## Notes

Semi-armor piercing round for the QF 5.25-inch Mark I gun, representing the classic British approach to dual-purpose ammunition design. Fired at 2,672 fps muzzle velocity. The SAP shell featured a hardened nose for penetrating light armor combined with a substantially larger bursting charge than the APC variant (4.0 lbs vs 2.4 lbs), making it effective against both armored destroyers and unarmored targets like aircraft. This compromise design could still penetrate 90mm of armor at 10,000 yards while delivering better high-explosive effect. The Mark III SAP became the preferred loading for most operational scenarios, with ships typically carrying a higher proportion of SAP than APC rounds. The 5.25-inch SAP proved highly effective during engagements with German destroyers and in AA defense of the Home Fleet. Ships like HMS Duke of York and HMS Anson used this ammunition extensively during Arctic convoy operations and the final pursuit of Scharnhorst.
