## Notes

Semi-armor piercing round for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI dual-purpose gun used extensively on British destroyers and convoy escorts. Fired at 2,660 fps muzzle velocity from the Mark XIX mounting. The SAP design represented a British specialty - a compromise between armor penetration and high explosive effect, making it effective against both destroyer-type vessels and aircraft. The hardened nose could penetrate light armor before the base fuze detonated the bursting charge inside the target, maximizing damage. This shell saw extensive service in all theaters during WWII, particularly effective in surface engagements against enemy destroyers and light craft. The Mark XVI gun and ammunition combination proved highly successful on Battle-class destroyers and numerous escort vessels, serving well into the 1960s in Royal Navy and Commonwealth service.
