## Notes

Armor-piercing capped round for the BL 4.7-inch Mark XII gun used on interwar British destroyers of the A to I classes. Fired at 2,650 fps muzzle velocity from 45-caliber barrels. The APC design featured a soft steel cap over the hardened armor-piercing body, designed to prevent shattering on impact with face-hardened armor - a significant advancement over earlier uncapped AP shells. While primarily a destroyer weapon, the 4.7-inch APC could penetrate up to 95mm of armor at 10,000 yards, making it effective against light cruisers and destroyers. The relatively small bursting charge was typical of interwar AP design philosophy. These destroyers saw extensive service in the early war years, particularly in the Mediterranean, though they were gradually replaced by vessels mounting the more effective 4.5-inch guns. The Mark X APC remained in service through 1945 on older destroyers relegated to convoy escort duties.
