Standard APC shell for Queen Elizabeth-class battleships and HMS Renown/Repulse. Used 4crh ogive with ballistic cap. Fired at 2,450 fps muzzle velocity from 42-caliber guns. The relatively small bursting charge was typical of early WWI-era AP shells. This shell served throughout both World Wars with excellent armor penetration characteristics.
