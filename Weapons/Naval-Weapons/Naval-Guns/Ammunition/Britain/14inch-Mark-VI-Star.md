## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the BL 14-inch Mark VII gun on King George V-class battleships, providing the most powerful battlefield illumination capability in the Royal Navy. Fired at 2,483 fps muzzle velocity with maximum range of over 35,000 yards, the star shell could reach altitudes of 10,000-15,000 feet depending on range and fuze settings. Upon fuze function, the shell ejected an enormous 3 million candlepower magnesium flare suspended on a large parachute, burning for 90 seconds and illuminating an area of 15-20 square miles - sufficient to reveal an entire enemy battle squadron. This capability proved decisive during the night action against Scharnhorst (December 26, 1943), where HMS Duke of York used 14-inch star shells to illuminate the German battlecruiser during the hours-long pursuit through Arctic darkness. The massive illumination allowed the British force to maintain continuous fire despite challenging weather conditions. KGV-class battleships typically carried a small number of star shells (3-5% of total ammunition) in each turret for immediate night action capability.
