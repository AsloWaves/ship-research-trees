## Notes

High-explosive shell for shore bombardment and anti-ship use against unarmored targets. Used lyddite (picric acid) or later Shellite D (TNT/beeswax mixture) as the bursting charge. Extensively used during WWI at Gallipoli and for shore bombardment operations in WWII. The relatively heavy shell weight combined with substantial explosive charge made it effective for demolition work and bombardment of coastal fortifications.
