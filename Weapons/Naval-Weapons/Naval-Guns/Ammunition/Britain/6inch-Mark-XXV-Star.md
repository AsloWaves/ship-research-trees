## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the BL 6-inch Mark XXIII gun, providing powerful battlefield illumination for cruiser operations. Fired at 2,758 fps muzzle velocity with precision time fuzes set for bursts at 6,000-10,000 feet altitude depending on tactical requirements. Upon fuze function, the shell ejected a brilliant 1,000,000 candlepower magnesium flare suspended on a large parachute, burning for a full minute and illuminating an area of 8-10 square miles. This exceptional performance made the 6-inch star shell invaluable during night cruiser actions in the Mediterranean, where British doctrine emphasized aggressive night surface warfare. The rounds were crucial during major night battles including Matapan (March 1941), where star shell illumination from cruisers HMS Ajax, Orion, and Gloucester revealed the Italian fleet to Admiral Cunningham's battleships with devastating effect. Town and Colony-class cruisers typically carried star shells as 10% of their 6-inch ammunition load, maintaining ready star shells in each turret for immediate illumination capability.
