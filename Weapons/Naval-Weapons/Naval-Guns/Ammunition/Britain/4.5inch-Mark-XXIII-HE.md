## Notes

Improved high explosive round for the QF 4.5-inch gun, introduced late in WWII with significantly enhanced bursting charge compared to the earlier Mark V. Fired at 2,449 fps muzzle velocity. The Mark XXIII incorporated lessons learned from wartime experience, featuring improved fragmentation characteristics and a more powerful bursting charge that made it exceptionally effective against both aircraft and unarmored surface targets. The increased HE content (15.5% vs 13.6% in Mark V) provided greater lethality at the cost of slightly reduced armor penetration. This round became the standard HE loading for post-war Royal Navy destroyers and saw extensive service during the Korean War, Suez Crisis, and various Cold War actions. The Mark XXIII's effectiveness in shore bombardment roles made it particularly valued by Commonwealth navies, remaining in front-line service through the 1960s on Daring-class and Battle-class destroyers.
