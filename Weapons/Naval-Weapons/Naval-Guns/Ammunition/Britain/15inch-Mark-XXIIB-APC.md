Improved interwar APC shell with 6crh streamlined design and improved ballistic cap. Featured a larger bursting charge (1.1% vs 0.7%) compared to Mark I, improving post-penetration damage. Used in modernized Queen Elizabeth-class battleships and HMS Vanguard. The shell incorporated lessons learned from WWI and interwar gunnery trials, with better aerodynamics and penetration performance.
