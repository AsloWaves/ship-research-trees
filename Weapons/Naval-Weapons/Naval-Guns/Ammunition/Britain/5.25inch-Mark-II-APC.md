## Notes

Armor-piercing capped round for the QF 5.25-inch Mark I dual-purpose gun, one of the most advanced British naval weapons of WWII. Fired at 2,672 fps muzzle velocity from King George V-class battleships and various cruisers and carriers. The 5.25-inch gun represented an ambitious attempt to create a truly effective dual-purpose weapon capable of engaging both surface vessels and aircraft with the same mounting. The APC shell featured excellent ballistic characteristics and could penetrate 110mm of armor at 10,000 yards - sufficient to defeat destroyer and light cruiser armor. The soft steel cap prevented shattering against face-hardened armor. While the gun's rate of fire (7-8 rounds/minute) was somewhat slow for optimal AA work, the APC round made the 5.25-inch highly effective in surface engagements. The weapon and ammunition saw extensive service on the Home Fleet battleships and in the Mediterranean theater.
