## Notes

High-explosive shell for Nelson-class battleships. Used for shore bombardment and against unarmored vessels. Filled with TNT or Shellite D. HMS Rodney famously used both AP and HE shells during the final engagement with Bismarck in May 1941, with HE rounds contributing to the destruction of the German battleship's superstructure. The massive explosive content made these shells devastating against soft targets.
