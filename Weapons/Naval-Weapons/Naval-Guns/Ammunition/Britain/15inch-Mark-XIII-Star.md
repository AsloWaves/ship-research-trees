## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the legendary BL 15-inch Mark I gun, providing the Royal Navy's capital ships with unparalleled night fighting capability from WWI through WWII. Fired at 2,450 fps muzzle velocity with maximum range exceeding 33,000 yards, the star shell could reach altitudes of 12,000-16,000 feet. Upon fuze function, it ejected a brilliant 3.5 million candlepower magnesium flare suspended on a large parachute, burning for 90 seconds and illuminating an area of 18-22 square miles. This massive illumination capability allowed British battleships to dominate night surface actions. The 15-inch star shell saw its first major use at Jutland (1916) and continued service through both World Wars. Notable uses included the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941), where HMS Warspite, Valiant, and Barham used star shells to illuminate the Italian fleet for devastating close-range fire, and during bombardment operations at Normandy where star shells aided fire control for night shoots. Queen Elizabeth and Renown-class battleships typically maintained ready star shells in each turret throughout WWII.
