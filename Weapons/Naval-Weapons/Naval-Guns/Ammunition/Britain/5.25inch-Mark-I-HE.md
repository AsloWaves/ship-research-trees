## Notes

Dual-purpose HE shell for the QF 5.25-inch Mark I gun used on King George V-class battleships, Dido-class cruisers, and several fleet carriers. Fired at 2,672 fps muzzle velocity. Designed to engage both surface and air targets with equal effectiveness. Featured time fuzes for AA barrage fire and impact fuzes for surface work. The relatively heavy shell combined with good ballistics made it effective against aircraft, though the slow rate of fire (7-8 rpm) was a limitation. Used throughout WWII in major fleet actions including the pursuit of Bismarck and Mediterranean operations.
