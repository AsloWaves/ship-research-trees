Standard HE shell for the QF 4.5-inch gun used on late-war British destroyers including Battle-class and later vessels. Also used in the 4.5-inch Mark V dual-purpose mounting on aircraft carriers and auxiliary vessels. Fired at 2,449 fps muzzle velocity. The fixed QF (Quick-Firing) cartridge design enabled rapid fire rates up to 12 rounds per minute. Effective for both surface and AA engagements, though optimized for surface targets. Used extensively in post-war Royal Navy service.
