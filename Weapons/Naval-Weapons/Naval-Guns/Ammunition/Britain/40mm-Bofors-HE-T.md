## Notes

High explosive tracer variant of the standard Bofors 40mm round, introduced in 1942 to improve gunnery accuracy through visual feedback. Fired at 2,890 fps muzzle velocity. The tracer element burned brightly for approximately 5 seconds, allowing crews to observe the trajectory and make rapid fire corrections - crucial for engaging fast-moving aircraft. The slightly reduced bursting charge (to accommodate the tracer compound) was considered an acceptable trade-off for the improved hit probability. Standard practice was to load magazines with alternating HE and HE-T rounds, or with every third or fourth round being a tracer. This combination maximized both destructive effect and fire control effectiveness, contributing to the Bofors' reputation as one of the finest AA weapons of WWII.
