## Notes

Armor-piercing tracer round for the Bofors 40mm, designed for engaging lightly armored surface targets such as E-boats, landing craft, and coastal vessels. Fired at 2,890 fps muzzle velocity. The hardened steel core could penetrate approximately 50mm of armor at 500 yards at 90 degrees, making it effective against most small craft and light armor. While the primary role of the Bofors was anti-aircraft defense, the AP-T round proved valuable in surface engagements, particularly in coastal waters and during amphibious operations. The tracer element provided the same fire control benefits as in the HE-T round. British forces found AP-T particularly useful in the Mediterranean and Channel operations against German and Italian fast attack craft.
