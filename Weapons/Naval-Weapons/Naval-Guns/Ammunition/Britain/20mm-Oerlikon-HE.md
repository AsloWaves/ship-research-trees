## Notes

Standard high explosive round for the Swiss-designed Oerlikon 20mm automatic cannon, widely adopted by the Royal Navy from 1940 onwards as its primary light anti-aircraft weapon. Fired at 2,725 fps muzzle velocity. The HE shell was effective against aircraft and light surface targets at ranges up to 4,800 yards. Used extensively on virtually every class of British warship during WWII, from destroyers to battleships. The Oerlikon proved highly effective in close-range AA defense, particularly against Kamikaze attacks in the Pacific theater. Over 55,000 Oerlikon guns were manufactured for British service during the war.
