## Notes

Standard high explosive round for the QF 2-pounder Mark VIII naval gun, commonly known as the "pom-pom" due to its distinctive firing sound. Fired at 2,400 fps muzzle velocity. The 2-pdr served as the Royal Navy's primary close-range anti-aircraft weapon in the early war years before the adoption of Oerlikon and Bofors guns. Typically mounted in quad (Mark VII) or octuple (Mark VI) power-operated mountings that could deliver devastating volumes of fire. The cyclic rate of 96-98 rounds per minute per barrel meant an octuple mounting could theoretically fire 780 rounds per minute. Despite being obsolescent by 1942, the pom-pom remained in service throughout the war on older vessels and in shore installations, proving particularly effective in the Mediterranean theater.
