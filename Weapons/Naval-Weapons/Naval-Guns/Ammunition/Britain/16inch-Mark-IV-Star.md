## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the BL 16-inch Mark I gun on HMS Vanguard, representing the pinnacle of British battlefield illumination capability. Fired at 2,614 fps muzzle velocity with maximum range exceeding 40,000 yards, the star shell could reach altitudes of 15,000-20,000 feet depending on tactical requirements. Upon time fuze function, the shell ejected an enormous 4 million candlepower magnesium flare suspended on a massive parachute, burning for 100 seconds and illuminating an area of over 20 square miles - sufficient to reveal an entire enemy fleet formation even in the darkest conditions. The Mark IV incorporated improvements based on WWII experience, including enhanced stability during descent and improved all-weather performance. Despite never being used in combat (HMS Vanguard commissioned after the war's end), the 16-inch star shell demonstrated remarkable performance during peacetime exercises, with Royal Navy observers noting it could effectively illuminate targets at ranges where most other navies' star shells would have burned out. Vanguard maintained ready star shells in each turret throughout her service life for potential night surface actions.
