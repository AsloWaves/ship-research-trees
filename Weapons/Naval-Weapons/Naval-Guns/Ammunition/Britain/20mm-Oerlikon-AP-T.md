## Notes

Armor-piercing tracer round for the Oerlikon 20mm, designed primarily for engaging lightly armored targets such as E-boats, landing craft, and aircraft with armored components. Fired at 2,725 fps muzzle velocity. The hardened steel core could penetrate 20mm of armor at 100 yards at 90 degrees. The tracer element burned for approximately 2 seconds, allowing gunners to observe fall of shot and make corrections. While less commonly used than HE-I rounds in AA batteries, AP-T was valuable for engaging surface targets and served as a spotting round in mixed ammunition belts. The combination of penetration capability and visual feedback made it particularly useful for training purposes.
