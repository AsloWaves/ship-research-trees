## Notes

Semi-armor piercing round for the BL 8-inch Mark VIII gun mounted on County-class heavy cruisers. Fired at 2,805 fps muzzle velocity from 50-caliber barrels. The Mark X SAP represented British heavy cruiser ammunition philosophy - combining good armor penetration with substantial high-explosive effect. The hardened nose could penetrate 140mm of armor at 10,000 yards (sufficient for most cruiser engagements) while the 12.8 lb bursting charge delivered excellent post-penetration damage. This made it effective against both armored and unarmored targets. The County-class cruisers and their Mark X SAP served extensively in all theaters during WWII, seeing notable action during the pursuit of Bismarck (HMS Dorsetshire delivered the coup de grâce with 8-inch fire), in the Mediterranean against Italian cruisers, and in the Pacific against Japanese forces. The combination of long range (31,500 yards maximum) and dual-purpose effectiveness made the 8-inch SAP a formidable weapon, remaining in Royal Navy service through the early 1950s.
