## Notes

Common Pointed Capped shell for the BL 13.5-inch Mark V gun, representing an early British semi-armor piercing design. Fired at 2,582 fps muzzle velocity. The CPC designation indicated a shell designed for dual-purpose use - capable of defeating moderate armor while carrying a substantially larger bursting charge than pure AP shells (31.25 lbs vs 12.5 lbs). This made it more effective against lightly protected targets and provided better high-explosive effect when penetration was achieved. The Mark IV could still penetrate 260mm of armor at 10,000 yards, sufficient for most cruiser-type targets. British doctrine typically loaded magazines with a mix of APC and CPC shells, with APC for engaging heavily armored battleships and CPC for lighter targets and long-range fire where the improved burst effect compensated for reduced penetration. The 13.5-inch CPC saw limited action at Jutland where British super-dreadnoughts engaged German battlecruisers at long range. These shells were retired with their parent ships under the Washington Treaty.
