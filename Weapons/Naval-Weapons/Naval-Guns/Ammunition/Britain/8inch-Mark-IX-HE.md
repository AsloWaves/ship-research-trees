## Notes

High-explosive shell for County-class heavy cruisers. Used for engaging destroyers, shore targets, and unarmored vessels where penetration was not required. Filled with TNT or Shellite D. The substantial bursting charge made these rounds effective for shore bombardment and anti-destroyer work. County-class cruisers typically carried a mixed loading of APC and HE shells to handle different tactical situations encountered during convoy escort and surface actions.
