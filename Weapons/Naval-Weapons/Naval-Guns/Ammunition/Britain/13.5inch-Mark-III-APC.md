## Notes

Armor-piercing capped shell for the BL 13.5-inch Mark V gun mounted on Orion-class and King George V-class (1911) battleships - Britain's first "super-dreadnoughts." Fired at 2,582 fps muzzle velocity from 45-caliber barrels. The Mark III APC represented a significant advancement in British armor-piercing technology, featuring a soft steel cap that prevented shattering against face-hardened armor - a critical lesson from trials that showed uncapped shells could shatter on oblique impacts. The 13.5-inch gun firing the Mark III shell could penetrate 320mm of armor at 10,000 yards, making it superior to contemporary German 12-inch guns. However, the small bursting charge (only 1.0% of shell weight) reflected early WWI-era philosophy that emphasized penetration over post-penetration damage. These shells saw limited action at Jutland (1916) aboard HMS Orion, Monarch, Conqueror, and Thunderer. The 13.5-inch ships were largely relegated to secondary duties after 1918 and scrapped under the Washington Naval Treaty.
