## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the BL 4.7-inch Mark XII gun mounted on interwar British destroyers. Fired at 2,650 fps muzzle velocity with time fuze settings typically adjusted for bursts at 4,000-6,000 feet altitude. Upon reaching the set altitude, the fuze would eject a 500,000 candlepower magnesium flare suspended on a small parachute, burning for approximately 45 seconds and illuminating several square miles of ocean. This capability was essential for night destroyer actions, which were common in the Mediterranean theater during the early war years. British destroyer doctrine emphasized aggressive night attacks, and effective star shell illumination was crucial to success. The 4.7-inch star shell saw extensive use during actions such as the Battle of Calabria (1940) and the Battle of Cape Matapan (1941), where night illumination played a decisive role. Destroyers typically carried star shells as 10-15% of their total ammunition load.
