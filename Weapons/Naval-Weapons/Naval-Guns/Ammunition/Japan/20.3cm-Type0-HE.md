## Notes

The Type 0 HE shell provided Japanese heavy cruisers with effective bombardment capability. These shells used shimose powder, a picric acid-based explosive developed by Japanese chemist Masachika Shimose. Shimose powder was more sensitive than TNT but provided greater blast effect. The shell was frequently used during shore bombardments and against unarmored vessels, proving particularly effective during the Guadalcanal campaign nighttime bombardments.
