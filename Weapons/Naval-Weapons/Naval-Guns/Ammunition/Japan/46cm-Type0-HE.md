## Notes

The Type 0 high-explosive shell was designed for bombardment operations and engaging unarmored targets. Though carried aboard Yamato-class battleships, these shells saw limited use as the vessels were primarily intended for surface engagements with armored warships. The large bursting charge made it devastating against land targets and light vessels.
