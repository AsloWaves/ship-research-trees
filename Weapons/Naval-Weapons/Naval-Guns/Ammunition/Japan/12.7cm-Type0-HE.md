## Notes

The Type 0 HE shell was the primary anti-aircraft and general-purpose round for Japanese destroyer main batteries. While Japanese destroyers prioritized torpedo attacks in their tactical doctrine, their gun armament proved essential in the numerous surface engagements of the Pacific War. The high muzzle velocity and relatively large bursting charge made these shells effective against both surface targets and aircraft, though the manual loading and traverse rates limited anti-aircraft effectiveness against modern aircraft.
