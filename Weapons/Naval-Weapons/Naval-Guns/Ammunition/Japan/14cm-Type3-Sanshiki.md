## Notes

The 14cm Type 3 Sanshikidan represented an attempt to provide anti-aircraft capability to older vessels armed with 14cm batteries that lacked modern dual-purpose weapons. The development followed the same principles as other Sanshikidan rounds—creating a cloud of incendiary projectiles that could damage or destroy aircraft through direct hits or near misses. The 900 sub-projectiles created a denser pattern than smaller calibers, improving hit probability.

In practice, the 14cm Sanshikidan saw limited service due to the small number of 14cm-armed vessels still in active fleet service by 1942. Most ships carrying these weapons served in training roles or rear-area patrol duties where air attack was less likely. The few instances of combat employment showed the same limitations as other Sanshikidan types—ineffectiveness against robust modern aircraft, difficulty in fuze setting, and the need for accurate fire control data. The round's primary value was psychological, as the spectacular pyrotechnic display could sometimes disrupt attacking formations.
