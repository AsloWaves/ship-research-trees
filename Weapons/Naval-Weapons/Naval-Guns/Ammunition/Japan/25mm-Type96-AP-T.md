## Notes

The Type 96 AP-T round was designed primarily for use against lightly-armored aircraft and motor torpedo boats. The hardened steel core could penetrate aircraft armor plate and engine blocks at close range, making it more effective than HE rounds against robust American aircraft such as the F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair. The round was particularly valued for its ability to damage aircraft even with non-critical hits.

IJN anti-aircraft doctrine called for loading belts with a mix of AP-T and HE-T rounds, typically in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio. The AP-T rounds were intended to inflict structural damage and knock out engines, while HE rounds targeted control surfaces and fuel systems. Against PT boats and landing craft, pure AP-T loading was sometimes used to maximize penetration capability. The yellow/white tracer distinguished it from the red/orange HE-T tracer, allowing experienced crews to monitor their ammunition mix during sustained engagements.
