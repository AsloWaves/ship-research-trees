## Notes

The 41cm Type 3 Sanshikidan was one of the most formidable anti-aircraft projectiles ever conceived, carrying 5,400 incendiary sub-projectiles that created a massive aerial burst pattern. The round was developed for the Nagato-class battleships, which received extensive anti-aircraft upgrades during wartime refits but still lacked sufficient light and medium AA armament to defend against massed air attacks. The Type 3 was intended to provide long-range interception capability beyond the reach of conventional AA guns.

Combat experience with the 41cm Sanshikidan mirrored that of other large-caliber Type 3 shells—impressive visual effect but minimal practical results. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Nagato fired numerous Type 3 rounds at attacking American carrier aircraft, creating enormous pyrotechnic displays that did little to stop determined attacks. The fundamental problem was unchanged from smaller calibers: the time of flight to high altitude was so long (30+ seconds to 20,000m) that aircraft could maneuver out of the predicted impact zone before the shell burst. Additionally, the slow rate of fire (approximately 1.5 rounds per minute) meant that only a handful of shells could be fired during a typical attack run. The 41cm Sanshikidan stands as a monument to Japanese ingenuity and desperation, a technically sophisticated weapon that could not overcome the tactical realities of modern aerial warfare.
