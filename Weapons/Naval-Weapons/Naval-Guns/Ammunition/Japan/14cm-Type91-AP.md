## Notes

The 14cm Type 91 AP was designed for Japan's light cruisers and older armored cruisers armed with 14cm main batteries, including ships like Tenryu and Tatsuta. The armor-piercing shell incorporated the same ballistic cap technology developed for larger-caliber rounds, allowing it to defeat face-hardened armor at oblique impact angles. The 14cm AP was intended primarily for use against enemy cruisers and large destroyers at medium ranges.

By the time of the Pacific War, most 14cm-armed ships had been relegated to secondary duties or converted to training vessels, as newer light cruisers mounted the superior 15.5cm gun. However, some 14cm weapons found new life aboard auxiliary cruisers and converted merchant raiders, where they provided substantial firepower for commerce warfare. The Type 91 AP's combination of penetration and bursting charge made it effective against armed merchant cruisers and Q-ships that might otherwise outgun standard auxiliary vessels.
