## Notes

The 41cm Type 91 AP shell equipped the Nagato-class battleships, which were Japan's most powerful battleships prior to the Yamato class. Like its larger 46cm counterpart, this shell featured the revolutionary underwater trajectory capability, with a specially designed nose cap that prevented tumbling when the shell struck water. This allowed the shell to maintain a relatively straight path underwater and strike targets below the waterline or armor belt. The Type 91 designation was shared across multiple calibers and represented a family of advanced armor-piercing shells that gave Japan a significant tactical advantage in the early Pacific War.
