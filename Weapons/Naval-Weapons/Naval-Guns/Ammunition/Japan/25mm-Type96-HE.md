## Notes

The 25mm Type 96 HE was the standard ammunition for the IJN's most numerous anti-aircraft weapon system. Despite being widely deployed throughout the fleet, the round suffered from several significant deficiencies. The small bursting charge provided minimal fragmentation effect, and the base fuze frequently failed to detonate on aircraft fabric surfaces. The round was most effective when used in concentrated barrage fire from multiple mounts.

The Type 96 25mm system, while copied from the French Hotchkiss design, used ammunition manufactured to Japanese specifications. Quality control issues during wartime production led to inconsistent performance, with some batches experiencing higher-than-normal dud rates. By 1944, the inadequacy of the 25mm system against robust American aircraft was widely recognized, but Japan lacked the industrial capacity to replace it with more effective weapons.
