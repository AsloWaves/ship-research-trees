## Notes

The Type 3 San-shiki was one of the most unusual naval ammunition types ever developed. Designed as an anti-aircraft barrage shell, it functioned as a giant shotgun shell that dispersed 900 incendiary tubes in a cone pattern. Each tube contained magnesium and thermite and was coated with rubber to provide spin stabilization. When the time fuze activated, an ejection charge expelled the tubes forward in a spreading pattern meant to destroy aircraft through impact and fire damage.

The shell was famously used during the Battle of Okinawa when Yamato fired these shells at attacking American aircraft. However, the weapon proved largely ineffective due to the difficulty of timing and aiming such massive guns against fast-moving aircraft. The concept was innovative but impractical, representing the Imperial Japanese Navy's desperate attempts to defend their battleships against overwhelming air superiority.
