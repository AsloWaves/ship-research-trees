## Notes

The Type 96 HE-T was developed shortly after the standard HE round to improve aiming accuracy during anti-aircraft engagements. The tracer element allowed gunners to observe their fire and make corrections, which was essential given the limited training many IJN AA crews received as the war progressed. The tracer composition reduced the already-small bursting charge slightly, but the improved accuracy was considered a worthwhile tradeoff.

In practice, the bright tracer could also serve as a warning to enemy pilots, allowing them to take evasive action. IJN doctrine typically called for mixing HE-T rounds with standard HE and AP-T ammunition in a ratio that provided adequate fire observation without excessive visual signature. The standard loading was approximately 1 tracer round per 3-5 non-tracer rounds, though this varied by ship and tactical situation.
