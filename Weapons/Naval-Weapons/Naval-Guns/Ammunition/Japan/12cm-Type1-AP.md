## Notes

The 12cm Type 1 AP was developed to provide older destroyer classes with effective armor-piercing capability against enemy destroyers and light cruisers. The capped design helped the shell maintain integrity when striking face-hardened armor at oblique angles, while the base fuze ensured detonation occurred after penetration. The round incorporated lessons learned from the more sophisticated 12.7cm Type 1 AP, scaled down for the smaller caliber.

In practice, 12cm-armed destroyers rarely engaged in surface actions after 1942, as most major fleet engagements involved the more modern 12.7cm-armed destroyer classes. The Type 1 AP found its primary use in convoy escort duties, where it provided a defense against enemy destroyers attempting to intercept Japanese supply lines. Several instances were recorded of 12cm-armed destroyers successfully driving off or damaging Allied submarine-hunting destroyers using Type 1 AP at ranges under 10,000 meters.
