## Notes

The 36cm Type 0 Star Shell represented the apex of Japanese illumination technology for most of the war, providing unprecedented range and illumination intensity. The massive illuminant canister produced a brilliant light visible for dozens of kilometers, capable of illuminating entire naval formations. The Kongo-class fast battleships, which frequently operated with cruiser divisions in night actions, used these star shells to dominate nighttime engagements through superior reconnaissance and target illumination.

Combat employment of 36cm star shells demonstrated both their effectiveness and limitations. During night actions in the Guadalcanal campaign, Kongo-class ships used star shells to illuminate American forces at ranges exceeding 20,000 meters, well beyond the effective range of most American searchlights. The brilliant illumination allowed Japanese forces to conduct precision torpedo attacks and gunfire while maintaining tactical advantage. However, the massive muzzle flash from firing 36cm guns also revealed the battleship's position, sometimes negating the reconnaissance advantage. Additionally, the slow rate of fire of battleship main guns (approximately 2 rounds per minute) meant that maintaining continuous illumination required careful coordination between multiple turrets. By 1944, with American forces routinely employing radar and starshells of their own, the 36cm star shell's tactical value diminished significantly.
