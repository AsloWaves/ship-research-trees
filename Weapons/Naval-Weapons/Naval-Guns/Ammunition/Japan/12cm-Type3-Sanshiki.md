## Notes

The 12cm Type 3 Sanshikidan was a scaled-down version of the famous large-caliber Type 3 shells, designed to provide older destroyers with anti-aircraft capability beyond the range of their light AA weapons. Upon reaching the set altitude, the time fuze ignited an expelling charge that burst the shell casing and scattered 650 incendiary tubes in a shotgun-like pattern. Each tube burned intensely, intended to ignite aircraft fuel tanks and damage control surfaces.

The effectiveness of the 12cm Sanshikidan was limited by several factors. The relatively small number of sub-projectiles compared to larger-caliber versions meant the pattern density was lower, reducing hit probability. The mechanical time fuze required manual setting and precise fire control data, which older destroyers often lacked. Most critically, American aircraft of 1943-45 featured self-sealing fuel tanks and increasingly robust construction that made them resistant to incendiary damage. Despite these limitations, the Type 3 provided a capability where none previously existed, and several instances of aircraft damage were attributed to Sanshikidan bursts during desperate defensive actions.
