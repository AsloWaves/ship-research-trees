## Notes

The 46cm Type 0 Practice round was essential for training the gun crews of Yamato and Musashi, the only ships to carry these massive weapons. The practice shell was manufactured to the exact same external dimensions and weight as the Type 91 AP shell, ensuring identical ballistic performance. This allowed gun crews to conduct realistic firing exercises without expending precious combat ammunition or risking the catastrophic effects of live ammunition in training areas.

Due to the immense cost and complexity of manufacturing 46cm shells, practice rounds were used sparingly even for training purposes. Most gunnery exercises for Yamato-class ships used sub-caliber training devices or theoretical calculations rather than full-caliber practice shoots. The few practice rounds that were manufactured typically featured a mild steel body filled with concrete and sand to achieve the correct weight distribution. Upon impact with water, the shell would break apart rather than maintaining integrity like a combat AP round. Security concerns meant that practice shoots were conducted only in restricted waters far from potential enemy observation, as the distinctive splash pattern would reveal details about the gun's performance characteristics.
