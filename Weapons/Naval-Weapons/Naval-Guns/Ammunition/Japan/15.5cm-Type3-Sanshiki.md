## Notes

The 15.5cm Type 3 Sanshikidan was one of the more effective variants of the Type 3 concept, benefiting from the large shell volume that allowed for 1,200 incendiary sub-projectiles. The round saw extensive use aboard the Yamato-class battleships, where it formed part of the sophisticated anti-aircraft defense system. The high muzzle velocity and good ballistic coefficient allowed engagement of high-altitude bombers that were beyond the effective range of lighter AA weapons.

Combat reports from Yamato and Musashi indicate mixed results with the Type 3 Sanshikidan. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea (1944), Yamato's secondary battery fired numerous Sanshikidan rounds at attacking American aircraft, creating impressive pyrotechnic displays but achieving few confirmed hits. The mechanical time fuzes proved difficult to set accurately under combat conditions, and the pattern density was insufficient against dispersed formations. During Yamato's final sortie in April 1945, the ship expended hundreds of Type 3 rounds against massive air attacks, but the overwhelming numbers of attackers rendered even well-aimed barrages ineffective. Despite these limitations, the 15.5cm Sanshikidan remained one of Japan's most capable long-range AA projectiles.
