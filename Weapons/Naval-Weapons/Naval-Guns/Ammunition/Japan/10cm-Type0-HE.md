## Notes

The Type 0 HE shell was specifically designed for the excellent Type 98 10cm/65 dual-purpose gun system, Japan's most effective naval anti-aircraft weapon of World War II. The fixed ammunition and high muzzle velocity gave this weapon a high rate of fire (15-20 rounds per minute) and excellent ballistic performance. The Akizuki-class destroyers, which mounted eight of these guns in four twin turrets, were specifically designed as anti-aircraft escorts and represented Japan's most advanced destroyer design of the war.

The shell featured a sensitive impact/proximity fuze combination that made it effective against both aircraft and surface targets. While this weapon system came too late and in too few numbers to significantly affect the air war over the Pacific, it was recognized by Allied intelligence as the most capable Japanese naval AA gun of the war. The high velocity and dual-purpose capability made it superior to earlier Japanese AA weapons and comparable to contemporary American 5-inch/38 caliber systems.
