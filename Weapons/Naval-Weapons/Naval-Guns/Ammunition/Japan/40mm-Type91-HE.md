## Notes

The 40mm Type 91 represented Japan's belated attempt to adopt the highly successful Bofors 40mm design that dominated Allied anti-aircraft defense. Development began in 1943 after IJN observers noted the effectiveness of Bofors guns in Allied hands, and captured examples were studied intensively. However, Japan's deteriorating industrial situation meant that production never reached significant numbers, with most installations limited to late-war carriers and capital ships.

The Type 91 HE round was mechanically and ballistically similar to the Allied Bofors ammunition, featuring superior range, hitting power, and reliability compared to the ubiquitous 25mm Type 96. The larger bursting charge provided much better fragmentation effect, and the mechanical time fuze allowed for airburst capability against aircraft formations. Unfortunately for the IJN, the 40mm system came too late and in too small quantities to significantly impact the overwhelming Allied air superiority of 1944-45.
