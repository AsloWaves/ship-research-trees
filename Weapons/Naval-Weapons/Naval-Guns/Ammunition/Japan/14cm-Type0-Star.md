## Notes

The 14cm Type 0 Star Shell served aboard Japan's older light cruisers and auxiliary vessels that mounted 14cm main batteries. The round provided greater illumination capability than destroyer-caliber star shells, with a larger illuminant canister and longer burn time. This made it valuable for illuminating larger areas during fleet actions or for conducting nighttime search operations in waters suspected of harboring enemy submarines or surface raiders.

By the outbreak of the Pacific War, most 14cm-armed ships were assigned to secondary duties such as training or convoy escort, limiting the tactical employment of the Type 0 Star Shell. However, these vessels occasionally found themselves in surface actions where night illumination was critical. The round saw use in various minor engagements throughout the South Pacific and in anti-submarine operations in home waters. The larger caliber provided superior range compared to destroyer star shells, allowing 14cm-armed cruisers to illuminate targets while remaining outside the effective range of enemy destroyer guns.
