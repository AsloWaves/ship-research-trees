## Notes

The 36cm Type 91 AP shell was used by Japan's fast battleships and battlecruisers, including the famous Kongo-class which saw extensive action throughout the Pacific War. This shell incorporated the same underwater trajectory technology as the larger caliber Type 91 shells, though to a lesser extent due to size constraints. The Kongo-class vessels were among the most active Japanese capital ships of World War II, participating in numerous engagements from the invasion of the Philippines to the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
