## Notes

The 12.7cm Type 1 AP shell was the standard armor-piercing ammunition for the Imperial Japanese Navy's large destroyers, which were among the most powerful destroyer types in the world. Japanese destroyers emphasized night-fighting capabilities and offensive torpedo armament, with their guns serving both anti-surface and anti-aircraft roles. The Type 1 AP shell featured a semi-armor-piercing design (common shell) that provided good penetration against light armor while still having enough explosive filler for blast effect against unarmored targets. These destroyers and their guns participated in virtually every major naval engagement of the Pacific War.
