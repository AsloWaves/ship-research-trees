## Notes

The 12cm Type 0 HE was the standard high-explosive round for Japan's older destroyer classes, including the Minekaze, Momi, and Kamikaze classes that predated the widespread adoption of the 12.7cm gun. The round featured a relatively large bursting charge for its caliber, making it effective against unarmored targets and capable of inflicting significant blast damage on destroyer-sized vessels.

By the time of Pearl Harbor, most frontline IJN destroyers had transitioned to the superior 12.7cm gun, relegating 12cm-armed vessels to secondary roles such as convoy escort, patrol duty, and transport. However, the 12cm Type 0 saw extensive service throughout the war in these roles. The round proved particularly effective during shore bombardment missions and anti-submarine warfare, where its combination of range and explosive power was well-suited to supporting amphibious operations and attacking surfaced submarines.
