## Notes

The 36cm Type 3 Sanshikidan was developed specifically for the Kongo-class fast battleships, which frequently operated with carrier task forces and thus faced intensive air attack. With 4,800 incendiary sub-projectiles, the round created the densest pattern of any Type 3 shell except the massive 46cm version. IJN doctrine called for firing Sanshikidan in salvos, creating multiple overlapping bursts that theoretically could intercept even large formations of bombers.

The Kongo-class ships expended substantial quantities of Type 3 ammunition during major fleet actions in 1944. At the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Haruna and Kongo fired dozens of Sanshikidan rounds at American carrier aircraft, creating spectacular but largely ineffective aerial barrages. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the fast battleships again employed Type 3 shells during air attacks, with similarly disappointing results. The fundamental problem was not the ammunition itself—the pattern density and incendiary effect were theoretically adequate—but rather the impossibility of accurately predicting aircraft positions seconds in advance. Even with advanced fire control systems, the time lag between firing and shell burst at 15,000+ meters meant that maneuvering aircraft could easily avoid the burst area. The 36cm Sanshikidan's legacy is thus one of technological sophistication that could not overcome tactical reality.
