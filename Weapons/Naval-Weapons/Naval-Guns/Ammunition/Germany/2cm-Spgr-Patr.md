## Notes

The 2cm Spgr. Patr. was the earliest standard high-explosive round for German 2cm anti-aircraft guns, introduced with the Flak 30. Unlike the later L'Spur variant, this version lacked a tracer element, making it less desirable for fire control purposes but slightly more consistent in ballistic performance. The round featured a sensitive impact fuze designed to detonate on contact with aircraft surfaces, spreading fragments in a cone pattern. In naval service, this ammunition saw widespread use early in the war but was gradually supplemented and often replaced by tracer variants that provided better fire control. The round remained in production throughout the war as basic training ammunition and for situations where tracer observation was unnecessary or undesirable, such as night combat where tracers could reveal gun positions.
