## Notes

The 40.6cm Pzgr. L/4.4 was designed as the armor-piercing projectile for the planned H-class super-battleships, which were never completed. This shell represented the pinnacle of German armor-piercing projectile design, incorporating all lessons learned from earlier battleship ammunition development. The 1,030-kilogram projectile would have been among the heaviest AP shells ever designed, exceeded only by the Japanese 46cm Type 91 shell. Theoretical penetration calculations suggested this shell could defeat any armor protection afloat or planned during the early 1940s, including the belt armor of Iowa-class battleships. The design featured a heavy ballistic cap and hardened steel body manufactured using advanced metallurgical techniques developed for the 38cm shells. The relatively small bursting charge followed German AP philosophy prioritizing penetration over post-penetration explosive effect. Prototype shells were manufactured for testing purposes but never saw operational use as the H-class program was cancelled in 1942 when resources were redirected to U-boat construction. The ammunition design work continued sporadically until 1943 as part of long-range naval planning, but by then the strategic situation made completion of such vessels impossible.
