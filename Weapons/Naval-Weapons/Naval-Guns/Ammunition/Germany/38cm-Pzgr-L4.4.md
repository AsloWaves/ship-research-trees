## Notes

The 38cm Pzgr. L/4.4 was the standard armor-piercing shell for the Bismarck-class battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz. This shell featured a hardened steel cap and ballistic cap for improved penetration. The relatively small bursting charge was typical of German AP shells, which prioritized penetration over post-penetration damage. These shells were used in the famous engagement where Bismarck sank HMS Hood with a catastrophic magazine hit in May 1941.
