## Notes

The 15cm Spgr. L/4.5 was the standard high-explosive shell for German 15cm naval guns. Used for anti-destroyer work, shore bombardment, and against unarmored targets. The shell featured a base-detonating fuse and provided excellent fragmentation effect. These shells were the most commonly used type for 15cm guns in most combat situations, being more versatile than AP shells. Used extensively during the Channel Dash in 1942 and various convoy operations in the Baltic and Arctic.
