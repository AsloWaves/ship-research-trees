## Notes

The 15cm Spgr. L/4.5 Bdz was developed specifically for the Type 1936A and later destroyers (Z23-Z39) that were armed with more powerful 15cm guns instead of the standard 12.7cm armament. The "Bdz" (Bodenzunder) designation indicates a base-detonating fuse designed to maximize penetration before detonation. This made the shell particularly effective against destroyer and light vessel targets, as it would penetrate the hull plating before exploding internally. These larger-gunned destroyers were intended to give German destroyers superiority over Allied counterparts in surface actions, particularly in the North Sea and Arctic theaters.
