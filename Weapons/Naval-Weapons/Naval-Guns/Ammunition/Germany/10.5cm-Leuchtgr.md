## Notes

The 10.5cm Leuchtgr. was a critical ammunition type for German destroyers and light cruisers, providing battlefield illumination during night actions. The shell contained a magnesium-aluminum pyrotechnic composition suspended beneath a small parachute, which was ejected from the shell casing at a predetermined altitude set by a time fuze. The brilliant white light produced allowed visual acquisition of enemy vessels during night surface actions, a capability essential for German destroyers operating in northern waters where darkness or twilight conditions prevailed for extended periods. The 45-second burn time provided sustained illumination while the parachute drifted slowly downward, though wind conditions could carry the flare significantly during descent. German destroyer tactics typically involved firing patterns of star shells to illuminate search areas or known enemy positions. These rounds saw extensive use during Arctic convoy battles, the Channel Dash, and Baltic Sea operations where night fighting was common. Each destroyer typically carried 10-15% of its ammunition load as star shells.
