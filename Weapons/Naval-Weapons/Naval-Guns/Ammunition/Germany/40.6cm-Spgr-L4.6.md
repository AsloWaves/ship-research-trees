## Notes

The 40.6cm Spgr. L/4.6 was designed as the high-explosive projectile for the planned H-class super-battleships that were never completed. This massive shell represented the ultimate development of German naval high-explosive ammunition, featuring a bursting charge of 74.5 kilograms of TNT - the largest explosive payload in any German naval shell design. The tremendous destructive power would have made this ammunition devastating against cruisers, destroyers, and merchant vessels, with a single hit likely causing catastrophic damage. The design incorporated nose fuze options for surface burst effects and base fuze variants for penetration before detonation. Theoretical fragmentation patterns suggested a lethal radius of approximately 45 meters, with dangerous fragments effective to over 200 meters. The shell was designed to be particularly effective against heavily-subdivided warship structures, where the massive explosive force could breach multiple compartments simultaneously. Like the AP variant, prototype shells were manufactured for ballistic testing but the H-class program cancellation in 1942 meant these rounds never saw operational use. Design work continued into 1943 as part of optimistic long-range planning, with engineers developing both standard HE and specialized anti-destroyer variants with base fuzes. The ammunition represented the culmination of German naval ordnance development but remained theoretical due to the strategic impossibility of completing the intended platforms.
