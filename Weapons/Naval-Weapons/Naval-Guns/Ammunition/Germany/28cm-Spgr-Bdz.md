## Notes

The 28cm Spgr. Bdz. was a base-fuzed high-explosive shell developed for the Scharnhorst-class battlecruisers, designed to penetrate light armor and deck plating before detonating inside enemy vessels. The base fuze location and short delay allowed the massive shell to punch through destroyer and light cruiser armor, detonating within hull spaces for maximum destructive effect. The 20.6-kilogram bursting charge, while smaller than some contemporary designs, proved devastatingly effective when detonating internally. This ammunition was particularly effective against British destroyers and armed merchant cruisers encountered during commerce raiding operations. During the Battle of North Cape (December 1943), Scharnhorst fired base-fuzed HE at British destroyers attempting torpedo attacks, achieving several damaging hits. The base fuze had to withstand enormous setback forces during firing while remaining sensitive enough for reliable functioning. The delayed detonation effect meant shells could penetrate multiple bulkheads before exploding deep within target ships, causing catastrophic damage to machinery spaces and magazines. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau typically loaded a mix of AP, nose-fuzed HE, and base-fuzed HE depending on expected targets, with base-fuzed rounds particularly valued for engaging destroyers and light cruisers.
