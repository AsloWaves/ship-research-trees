## Notes

The 38cm Leuchtgr. was the most powerful naval illumination round ever produced for operational service, designed for the Bismarck-class battleships. The massive 45-kilogram illuminant charge produced extraordinary brightness equivalent to 15 million candles, capable of illuminating ocean areas visible from extreme distances even in Arctic darkness and adverse weather. The 90-second burn time was the longest of any naval star shell in World War II, providing sustained illumination throughout extended engagement sequences. The enormous parachute assembly required to deploy and slow this massive flare represented a significant engineering achievement, designed to withstand deployment at high altitude and extreme descent velocities. During Bismarck's final action (May 1941), star shells were reportedly prepared but the daytime engagement meant they were not employed. Tirpitz carried these rounds throughout her career for potential night surface actions that never materialized. The tremendous brightness could illuminate targets at maximum main battery range, allowing full utilization of the ship's gunnery capability in darkness. The high muzzle velocity meant star shells could be placed at very long ranges with flat trajectories, reducing flight time and allowing rapid illumination of distant targets. Each battleship typically carried 2-3% of main battery ammunition as star shells, representing approximately 20-25 rounds per vessel ready for immediate night action capability.
