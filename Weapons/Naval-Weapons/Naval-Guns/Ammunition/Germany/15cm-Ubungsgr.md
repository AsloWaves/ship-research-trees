## Notes

The 15cm Übungsgr. was the standard practice ammunition for German light cruiser gunnery training. The round replicated the weight and ballistic characteristics of service ammunition exactly, allowing realistic training without expending combat rounds or live explosives. The projectile body was filled with inert material (typically a sand/concrete mixture) to achieve the correct weight, with a small smoke pot or dye marker that could be installed to mark the point of impact for observation. Colored dye released on water impact created visible splashes for fall-of-shot spotting during training exercises. German cruisers conducted extensive gunnery training throughout the war when fuel availability permitted, with practice rounds conserving valuable explosive-filled ammunition for combat use. The Kriegsmarine maintained rigorous training standards, and crews regularly fired practice ammunition at towed targets or splash targets to maintain proficiency. Some practice rounds included a small spotting charge that produced a smoke puff on impact for better visibility. The ballistic match to service rounds meant that firing tables and range calculations used in practice directly applied to combat conditions.
