## Notes

The 12.7cm Spgr. Zt. was developed as the primary anti-aircraft ammunition for heavy German AA guns in the 12.7cm caliber, employed on major warships as part of their heavy anti-aircraft battery. The sophisticated mechanical time fuze allowed precise airburst placement against high-altitude bomber formations, a critical capability as Allied strategic bombing intensified. The fuze was set using automated fuze-setting equipment integrated with radar-directed fire control systems on late-war installations. The large bursting charge created an extensive fragmentation pattern effective against heavy bombers like the B-17 and Lancaster. These rounds were mounted on Bismarck, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and Gneisenau as part of their upgraded anti-aircraft armament. The high ceiling capability made this ammunition essential for engaging high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and bomber formations. Later production incorporated improved Dopp Z S/60 proximity fuzes when available, significantly increasing effectiveness by eliminating the need for precise fuze timing calculations.
