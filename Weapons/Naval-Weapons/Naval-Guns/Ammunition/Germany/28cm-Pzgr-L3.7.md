## Notes

The 28cm Pzgr. L/3.7 was the armor-piercing shell used by the Deutschland-class pocket battleships (Deutschland/Lutzow, Admiral Scheer, Admiral Graf Spee). This was an older design compared to the L/4.4 shells used on Scharnhorst-class, featuring a shorter and lighter projectile. Despite this, it achieved good penetration through high velocity from the SK C/28 gun. Most famously used by Admiral Graf Spee during the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939, and by Admiral Scheer during commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
