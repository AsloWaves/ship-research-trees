## Notes

The 8.8cm Pzgr. was developed to provide the famous 8.8cm Flak with anti-armor capability, a role it famously fulfilled in North African land campaigns. In naval service, this ammunition was employed by armed merchant raiders and auxiliary cruisers when engaging armored targets or when penetration of merchant vessel structures was required. The capped armor-piercing projectile could defeat the side armor of light cruisers and destroy critical machinery in merchant vessels with precision shots below the waterline. The ballistic cap improved penetration performance against face-hardened armor. While less commonly loaded aboard warships than HE ammunition, AP rounds were kept available for surface engagements. The high velocity and flat trajectory made accurate shooting relatively simple at typical naval engagement ranges. Admiral raiders such as Michel and Thor carried this ammunition for dealing with armed merchant cruisers or defensively equipped Allied merchantmen encountered in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.
