## Notes

The 20.3cm Pzgr. L/4.4 was the armor-piercing shell for the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers (Admiral Hipper, Blucher, Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, Lutzow). These shells featured excellent ballistic performance and achieved high penetration for their caliber through combination of good sectional density and high velocity. Prinz Eugen used these shells during the Denmark Strait engagement alongside Bismarck in May 1941, scoring hits on HMS Prince of Wales. The shells featured the typical German AP cap design with both armor-piercing and ballistic caps.
