## Notes

The 10.5cm Pzgr. was the armor-piercing round for German destroyer main batteries and light cruiser secondary armament. This ammunition was designed to engage enemy destroyers, light cruisers, and merchantmen at typical surface action ranges. The capped armor-piercing shell could defeat the side armor of contemporary destroyers and penetrate light cruiser belt armor at moderate ranges. The small bursting charge was typical of German AP design philosophy, prioritizing penetration over post-penetration effect. In practice, destroyers primarily used HE ammunition against surface targets, reserving AP for engagement with armored opponents. The high muzzle velocity provided flat trajectory and excellent accuracy. Z-class destroyers armed with 10.5cm SK C/32 guns carried a proportion of AP ammunition for surface engagements, though combat experience showed HE was more effective against the typical destroyer targets. The round saw action throughout the war in Baltic, North Sea, and Arctic operations.
