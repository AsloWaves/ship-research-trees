## Notes

The 10.5cm Spgr. L/4.4 was the standard heavy anti-aircraft shell for the Kriegsmarine, used on all major capital ships including Bismarck, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Admiral Hipper-class cruisers. This shell featured contact and proximity-fused variants, though the proximity-fused versions were rare and introduced late in the war. The shell provided the main heavy AA defense for German capital ships against high-altitude bombers. Used extensively during air attacks on Tirpitz in Norwegian fjords and during the final actions of major German warships.
