## Notes

The 3.7cm Spgr. L'Spur was the tracer variant of the standard 3.7cm high-explosive round, incorporating a pyrotechnic tracer element in the base to allow visual tracking of projectiles. The slightly reduced bursting charge (38g vs 41g in the non-tracer version) compensated for the weight of the tracer compound while maintaining identical ballistic performance. This ammunition became the preferred loading for naval anti-aircraft mounts, as the tracer allowed gun crews to observe fall of shot and make rapid corrections, crucial when engaging fast-moving aircraft targets. The 4-second burn time provided visibility throughout the engagement envelope. In night combat, the tracers were particularly valuable for fire control, though they did reveal gun positions to enemy aircraft. The twin-mount Flak M43 installations using this ammunition provided effective intermediate-range anti-aircraft defense on late-war destroyers and capital ships.
