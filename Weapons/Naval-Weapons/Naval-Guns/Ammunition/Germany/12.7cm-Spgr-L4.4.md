## Notes

The 12.7cm Spgr. L/4.4 was the standard high-explosive shell for German destroyer main armament. Used by the famous Z-class destroyers (Zerstorer) in numerous engagements including the Battles of Narvik, Channel Dash, and various convoy actions in the Atlantic and Arctic. The shell featured excellent fragmentation characteristics and was effective against both surface targets and aircraft. The relatively large bursting charge percentage made these shells particularly destructive against light-skinned vessels and shore installations.
