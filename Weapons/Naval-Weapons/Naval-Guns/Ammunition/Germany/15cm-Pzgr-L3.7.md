## Notes

The 15cm Pzgr. L/3.7 was the standard armor-piercing shell for German 15cm naval guns, used on light cruisers and as secondary armament on capital ships. These shells featured typical German AP construction with armor-piercing and ballistic caps. Used extensively by light cruisers like Leipzig, Nurnberg, and Emden during various operations. As secondary armament on Bismarck and Scharnhorst-class ships, these shells provided anti-cruiser capability and were effective against destroyer and light cruiser targets.
