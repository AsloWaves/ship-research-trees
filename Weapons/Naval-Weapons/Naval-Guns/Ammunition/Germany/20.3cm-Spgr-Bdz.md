## Notes

The 20.3cm Spgr. Bdz. was a specialized base-fuzed high-explosive round designed for enhanced penetration and delayed detonation effects. Unlike the standard nose-fuzed 20.3cm Spgr. L/4.7, the base fuze location allowed the shell to penetrate light armor plating, deck armor, or ship structures before detonating, maximizing internal damage. This made it particularly effective against destroyers, light cruisers, and merchant vessels where penetration into vital spaces was desired. The 0.025-second delay after impact allowed the shell to travel several meters into the target structure before detonation, creating devastating internal explosions. The base fuze mounting required careful design to withstand the extreme setback forces during firing (over 40,000 G's) while remaining sensitive enough to function reliably on target impact. Admiral Hipper-class cruisers typically carried a mix of nose-fuzed and base-fuzed HE rounds along with armor-piercing ammunition. The base-fuzed variant saw action during Arctic convoy battles and the Channel Dash, proving highly effective against British destroyers and escort vessels. The delayed detonation effect was particularly devastating against unarmored merchant vessels, where shells could penetrate deep into cargo holds before exploding.
