## Legendary & Iconic Torpedoes

### G7e (TII) - "The Silent Killer"
**Historical Impact**: **True wakeless torpedo**—battery-electric propulsion left NO visible wake, making U-boats nearly impossible to detect by lookouts. 28 kts, 11,000 yd range, 617 lbs warhead. Slower than steam G7a but invaluable for daylight attacks. Accounted for significant Allied shipping losses.

**Game Representation**: Tier 8 electric torpedo. No wake detection penalty. Slower speed balanced by stealth. Critical for daylight submarine gameplay.

### T5 Zaunkönig - "First Acoustic Homing"
**Historical Impact**: **World's first operational acoustic homing torpedo** (September 1943). Passive homing on destroyer/corvette propeller noise. Code-named "Wren" (Zaunkönig). Initially devastatingly effective against Allied escorts until countermeasures (Foxer noisemakers) deployed. Represented leap in torpedo technology—no longer required precise aim.

**Game Representation**: Tier 9 revolutionary weapon. First homing torpedo for Germany. Changes gameplay from manual aim to fire-and-forget. High cost but game-changing capability.

### T11 - "Advanced Acoustic"
**Historical Impact**: Most advanced German WWII torpedo. Two-speed capability (33 kts or 24 kts), active/passive sonar option, 18,000 yd range. Pattern-running + acoustic homing combination. Limited production (late 1944), few saw combat before war ended.

**Game Representation**: Tier 9 ultimate WWII weapon. Expensive but combines speed, range, and homing. Represents technological peak before German defeat.

### G7es (TIII) - "Pattern Runner"
**Historical Impact**: Revolutionary **pattern-running torpedo** for convoy attacks. Could be programmed to run circular or zigzag search patterns through convoy lanes. Even without hit, forces convoy to scatter. Introduced 1943, became standard for convoy operations.

**Game Representation**: Tier 8 specialized weapon. Area-denial capability. Effective against grouped targets (convoys) but wasted on single ships.

### SUT - "Export Success"
**Historical Impact**: Surface and Underwater Target torpedo (1967). Wire-guided heavyweight for Bundesmarine submarines (Type 206). Successful export to multiple navies. Represents West German post-war torpedo industry revival.

**Game Representation**: Tier 10 modern heavyweight. NATO-compatible. Balanced performance for Cold War era.

## Research Cost & Time Balance

**Tier-Based Scaling**:
- **Tier 1-2** (1873-1906): Low cost ($0-$180K), short time (0-45 days) - early development
- **Tier 3-5** (1906-1920): Medium cost ($140K-$750K), medium time (60-180 days) - WWI
- **Tier 6-8** (1920-1945): High cost ($600K-$3.5M), long time (150-420 days) - interwar/WWII innovation
- **Tier 9** (1943-1972): Very high cost ($2.6M-$5M), extended time (270-540 days) - acoustic homing
- **Tier 10** (1965-1975): Extreme cost ($4M-$10M), maximum time (360-600 days) - modern systems

**Special Considerations**:
- T5 Zaunkönig: High cost ($2.8M) for revolutionary acoustic homing technology
- T11: Very high cost ($3.5M) for advanced combined systems
- Pattern-running torpedoes: Moderate premium ($1.8M-$2M) for programming complexity
- Post-war hiatus: Seal DM1 requires only starting torpedo (fresh restart)
- Experimental HTP/rocket: Very high cost ($3.2M-$5M) for unproven technology
