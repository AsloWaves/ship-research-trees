## Next Steps After Assignment

1. Each agent receives this document + research_template.md
2. Agents begin parallel research immediately
3. Main orchestrator monitors progress
4. Results aggregated as agents complete
5. Validation and SQL generation by orchestrator
6. Final database application and summary report

**Good luck to all research agents!**
