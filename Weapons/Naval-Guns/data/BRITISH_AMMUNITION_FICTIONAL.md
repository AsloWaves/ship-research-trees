## Design Philosophy

### Creative Mark Designations
Following authentic Royal Navy naming conventions:
- **Mark + Roman Numerals**: Mark II, Mark XVIII, Mark Va
- **Letter Suffixes**: Mark IIa (heavy), Mark IIb (high-velocity)
- **Special Designations**: "Dreadnought", "Hood", "Vanguard Experimental"
- **Ship Class Names**: "King George", "Nelson Heavy", "Tribal Special"
- **Descriptive Names**: "Velocity", "Thunderer", "Battle"

### Ammunition Categories Generated

1. **Super-Heavy Shells** (APC/APCBC): Maximum penetration, lower velocity
2. **High-Velocity Shells** (HV-APC/AP): Extended range, flatter trajectory
3. **Ballistic Cap Improvements** (APCBC): Better penetration at range
4. **High-Capacity Explosives** (HE/HC): Increased bursting charge
5. **VT-Fused AA** (HE-VT): Proximity fuses for AA use
6. **Improved Semi-AP** (SAPC): Better dual-purpose performance
7. **Experimental/Maximum Charge**: "What-if" scenarios

## Balance Considerations

### Shell Weight vs. Velocity Trade-offs
- **Super-heavy**: +10-15% weight, -10-15% velocity, +20% penetration
- **High-velocity**: -10-15% weight, +10-15% velocity, +10% range
- **Ballistic cap**: +0% weight, +0% velocity, +15% long-range penetration

### VT-Fused AA Ammunition
- Same ballistics as standard HE
- +50-100% AA effectiveness (proximity fuse)
- Historic introduction: 1944-1945 (late-war)
- Post-war standard for all DP guns

### Range Extensions
- Historical max: 37,870 yards (15" Mark XVIIb)
- Fictional max: 40,000 yards (16" Mark III "Velocity")
- Reasonable extrapolation based on lighter shells
