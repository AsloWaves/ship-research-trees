---

## 🎯 Progression Milestones & Strategy

### **Early Game Strategy** (T1-T3 Ships)
**Recommended Investment**:
- Focus on 3-4 neutral crew cards
- Wait until Level 25 to commit to classifications
- Choose based on preferred playstyle:
  - Aggressive: 2 Gunners + 1 Torpedoman + 1 Engineer
  - Defensive: 1 Gunner + 1 AA + 1 Engineer + 1 Damage Control
  - Balanced: 2 Gunners + 1 Engineer + 1 Damage Control

**Cost**: 225,000-300,000₡ total (affordable from T2-T3 earnings)

---

### **Mid Game Strategy** (T4-T6 Ships)
**Recommended Investment**:
- Crew cards reach Level 80
- Choose 2-3 Advanced Specializations for primary roles
- Focus investment on main combat roles:
  - Gunner → Fire Control or Rapid Fire (depending on ship class)
  - Engineer → Speed or Endurance (depending on playstyle)

**Cost**: 1,000,000-1,500,000₡ additional (2-3 T5-T6 missions)

---

### **Late Game Strategy** (T7-T10 Ships)
**Recommended Investment**:
- Crew cards reach Level 150+
- Choose 1-2 Elite Specializations for critical roles
- High permadeath risk = carefully select which crew to risk
- Consider backup crew cards for critical positions

**Cost**: 5,000,000-10,000,000₡ additional (major commitment)

**Risk Management**:
- T8 zones: 30% permadeath = expect to lose 1 in 3 elite crew eventually
- T10 zones: 100% permadeath = only use disposable crew or accept total loss
- Insurance consideration: Keep backup Tier 2 crew for replacements

---

## 💡 Design Balance Points

### **Economic Pressure**
- Elite crew cost = 1-3 missions at appropriate tier
- Creates meaningful choice: upgrade ship vs. crew vs. modules
- Loss of elite crew = significant setback but not game-ending
- Encourages diverse progression (multiple crew cards, multiple specializations)

### **Time Investment**
- 400-500 hours per elite crew = serious commitment
- Matches ship progression timelines (T1-T10 = 200-400 hours)
- Players reach endgame with 1-2 elite crew naturally
- Further crew specializations = dedicated long-term goals

### **Permadeath Integration**
- T6 permadeath = 15% risk, elite crew still viable
- T8 permadeath = 30% risk, elite crew high stakes
- T10 permadeath = 100% risk, elite crew extremely risky
- Creates natural risk/reward: use elite crew for advantage vs. preserve them

### **Strategic Depth**
- 7 basic classifications × 3 advanced per class × 3 elite per advanced = 63 total specializations
- Each ship requires 5-15 crew positions (depending on tier)
- Impossible to master everything = specialization encouraged
- Player identity formed through crew composition choices
