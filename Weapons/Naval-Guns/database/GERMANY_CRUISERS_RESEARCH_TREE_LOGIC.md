## Overview

German cruiser development from unprotected cruisers through WWI light cruisers to WWII heavy cruisers. Germany pioneered modern light cruiser design with the Gazelle class (1901), developed powerful armored cruisers (Scharnhorst, Blücher), and built innovative heavy cruisers (Admiral Hipper class). The Deutschland-class "pocket battleships" are included in the Battleship tree (already completed).

**Key Innovations**:
- **First Modern Light Cruisers** (1901): Gazelle class - established modern light cruiser design
- **15cm Gun Standard** (1914): Pillau class - first 15cm (5.9") guns, became German standard
- **Waterline Belt Armor** (1911): Magdeburg class - improved protection
- **Interwar Innovation** (1925): SMS Emden - first post-Versailles cruiser
- **Heavy Cruisers** (1939): Admiral Hipper class - 8×20.3cm guns, powerful WWII cruisers

**Total Nodes**: 40 cruisers spanning 1890-1945 (paper designs)

## Branch Descriptions

### 1. Starting (2 nodes)
FREE starting cruisers. SMS Bussard (1890) represents early unprotected cruiser design. SMS Gazelle (1901) was the first modern light cruiser, establishing design principles used throughout WWI. Both provide tutorial introduction.

### 2. Protected Cruisers (2 nodes)
Last protected cruisers with armored deck protection. Victoria Louise class was Germany's last protected cruiser class. Kaiserin Augusta was a large protected cruiser with heavy armament.

### 3. Armored Cruisers (6 nodes)
Evolution from Fürst Bismarck (1900) through SMS Scharnhorst (famous for Coronel victory, sunk at Falklands) to SMS Blücher (transitional design approaching battlecruisers, sunk at Dogger Bank 1915). Heavy armor and powerful armament characterized German armored cruisers.

### 4. Light WWI Early (3 nodes)
First true light cruisers including Bremen class and Dresden class (commerce raiders). SMS Dresden was famous for evading British forces after Falklands. Established 10.5cm gun standard.

### 5. Light WWI Standard (3 nodes)
Kolberg introduced improved L/45 guns. SMS Magdeburg (1911) was first with waterline belt armor, significantly improving protection. SMS Karlsruhe achieved 27.5 kts speed. These formed WWI workhorses.

### 6. Light WWI Advanced (4 nodes)
SMS Pillau (1914) introduced 15cm (5.9") guns, becoming German standard and revolutionizing light cruiser armament (+30% firepower over 10.5cm). Graudenz, Wiesbaden, and Königsberg II classes refined this design to create ultimate WWI light cruisers.

### 7. Interwar Light (4 nodes)
SMS Emden (1925) was first post-Versailles cruiser, unique design. Königsberg class (1929) established modern light cruiser standard with 9×15cm guns and 32-knot speed. Leipzig and Nürnberg improved the design. These were Germany's last light cruisers.

### 8. Heavy Cruisers (5 nodes)
Admiral Hipper class (1939-1945) were Germany's only true heavy cruisers with 8×20.3cm (8") guns. Five ships planned: Admiral Hipper (lead ship), Blücher (sunk Norway 1940), Prinz Eugen (most famous, Bismarck escort, only major German surface ship to survive WWII), Seydlitz (incomplete, carrier conversion planned), Lützow (sold to USSR incomplete as Petropavlovsk).

### 9. Modernization (3 nodes)
Refits including WWI cruiser postwar improvements, SMS Emden 1940 refit with enhanced AA, and Prinz Eugen 1945 late-war configuration with maximum AA armament.

### 10. Paper Ships (8 nodes)
Cancelled designs including P-class heavy cruisers (Plan Z), M-class improved light cruisers, Improved/Super Hipper designs (9×20.3cm guns), Spähkreuzer (scout cruiser), dedicated AA cruiser, torpedo cruiser, and future post-war concepts. All have reliability penalties (-10% to -15%).
