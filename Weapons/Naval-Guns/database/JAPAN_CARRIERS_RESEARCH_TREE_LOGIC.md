# JAPAN AIRCRAFT CARRIERS RESEARCH TREE LOGIC

**Node Range**: 4100-4144 (45 nodes)
**Nation**: Japanese
**Ship Type**: Aircraft Carriers (CV)

## Overview

Japanese aircraft carrier development represents **the most advanced and successful carrier aviation program** of the early WWII period. The Imperial Japanese Navy pioneered naval aviation, created the **first purpose-built aircraft carrier** (Hōshō, 1922), executed history's **most devastating carrier strike** (Pearl Harbor), and operated the **largest aircraft carrier until the 1950s** (Shinano, 72,800 tons).

**Key Innovations**:
- **Hōshō (1922)**: **World's first purpose-built aircraft carrier** (not a conversion)
- **Akagi & Kaga**: Pearl Harbor strike force carriers (converted from capital ships)
- **Shōkaku & Zuikaku**: "Arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world" (1941)
- **Taihō (1944)**: **First Japanese armored carrier** (75-80mm flight deck)
- **Shinano (1944)**: **72,800 tons—largest carrier until USS Forrestal** (1954), converted Yamato-class

**Combat Achievements**:
- Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941): 6 carriers, 353 aircraft—most devastating carrier strike in history
- Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942): Sank British carriers Hermes and Cornwall
- Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942): First carrier-vs-carrier battle
- **Catastrophic Losses**: Midway (June 1942)—lost Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū in one day

## Historical Context

### Hōshō: World's First Purpose-Built Aircraft Carrier
**Revolutionary Achievement** (1922):
- **World's first purpose-built aircraft carrier** (not a conversion)
- Previous carriers: HMS Furious, HMS Argus (converted from other types)
- **7,470 tons**, 21 aircraft capacity
- **Flush deck design** (bridge/mast removed 1923 for clear deck)
- **Six small funnels** extending to port/starboard (could be raised/lowered)
- Served throughout WWII, survived the war

### Akagi & Kaga: Pearl Harbor Strike Force
**Treaty Era Conversions**:
- **Akagi**: Converted battlecruiser (originally Amagi-class), 36,500 tons, 66 aircraft
- **Kaga**: Converted battleship (originally Tosa-class), 38,200 tons, 90 aircraft (highest capacity)
- **Pearl Harbor** (December 7, 1941): Part of 6-carrier strike force, 353 aircraft
- **Major Rebuild** (1935-1938): Three flight decks → single enlarged flight deck + island
- **Battle of Midway** (June 4, 1942): Both lost in one day—catastrophic defeat

### Shōkaku & Zuikaku: The Best Japanese Carriers
"**Arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world**" (1941 completion):
- **25,675 tons**, 72-75 aircraft, **34 knots** speed
- **Participated in every major action except Midway**: Pearl Harbor, Indian Ocean, Coral Sea, Guadalcanal, Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf
- **Shōkaku**: Torpedoed and sunk by USS Cavalla at Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19, 1944)
- **Zuikaku**: **Last Pearl Harbor carrier to be sunk** (October 25, 1944, Battle of Leyte Gulf)
- Most successful Japanese carriers of the war

### Taihō: The Armored Carrier
**First Japanese Armored Flight Deck** (1944):
- **29,300 tons**, 53 aircraft capacity
- **75-80mm armored flight deck**—designed to withstand 500 kg bomb hits
- **Battle of Philippine Sea** (June 19, 1944): Torpedoed by USS Albacore
- **Tragic Loss**: Single torpedo → aviation fuel vapors accumulated → catastrophic explosion → sank
- **Lesson**: Armored deck provided no protection against internal explosion

### Shinano: The Largest Carrier
**Record-Breaking Dimensions** (1944):
- **72,800 tons full load**—**largest aircraft carrier until USS Forrestal** (1954, 81,000 tons)
- **265.8m long**, 36.3m beam—massive dimensions
- **Converted Yamato-class battleship** (after Midway losses, cancelled battleship hull converted)
- **Completed**: November 19, 1944, Yokosuka
- **Tragic Fate**: Sunk **10 days later** (November 29, 1944) by USS Archerfish—shortest operational life of any major carrier
- **Never operational**: Sunk during transfer voyage with incomplete watertight integrity

### Pearl Harbor: Most Devastating Carrier Strike
**December 7, 1941**:
- **6 carriers**: Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū, Shōkaku, Zuikaku
- **353 aircraft**: 183 first wave, 170 second wave
- **Results**: 4 battleships sunk, 4 damaged, 188 aircraft destroyed, 2,403 killed
- **Demonstrated**: Carrier aviation as dominant naval warfare method
- **Changed naval warfare forever**

### Battle of Midway: Catastrophic Loss
**June 4, 1942**—**Turning Point of Pacific War**:
- **Lost in ONE DAY**: Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū—**4 fleet carriers**
- **Lost**: 248 aircraft, 3,057 personnel, most experienced aircrew
- **Japan never recovered**: Pilot losses irreplaceable, carrier force crippled
- **End of expansion**: Offensive capability shattered permanently

## Summary

The Japanese aircraft carrier research tree represents the most advanced and successful early carrier aviation program in history. From Hōshō (world's first purpose-built carrier, 1922) to Shinano (largest carrier until USS Forrestal, 1954) to the devastating Pearl Harbor strike (6 carriers, 353 aircraft), Japan pioneered naval aviation and demonstrated carrier dominance over battleships.

The tree offers 45 nodes covering 1922-1970, providing multiple paths through:
- **Early Pioneers**: Hōshō (first purpose-built carrier)
- **Pearl Harbor Force**: Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū, Shōkaku, Zuikaku
- **Best Carriers**: Shōkaku & Zuikaku ("best in the world" 1941)
- **Armored Carriers**: Taihō (first armored), Shinano (largest ever)
- **Wartime Emergency**: Unryū class (simplified Hiryū-based)
- **Light/Escort**: Support carriers for ASW and convoy
- **Post-War**: JMSDF helicopter carriers

**Total**: 45 nodes with 2 FREE starting ships (Hōshō, Akagi).

**CONGRATULATIONS**: This completes the entire Japanese naval research tree system! All 218 nodes finished!
