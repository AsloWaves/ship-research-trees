# Japanese Destroyers Research Tree Logic

## Overview

This document defines the research tree structure for Japanese Destroyers (DD) in the naval warfare system. Japan developed some of the world's most powerful and innovative destroyer designs, culminating in the revolutionary **Fubuki "Special Type"**—which defined modern destroyer design for decades—and the legendary **Shimakaze**, the fastest destroyer ever built at **40.9 knots**. Japanese destroyers were renowned for their heavy torpedo armament featuring the deadly **Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo** with 40 km range.

**Node ID Range**: 4700-4744 (45 nodes)
**Nation**: Japan
**Ship Type**: DD (Destroyer)
**Time Period**: 1916-1960
**Tech Tiers**: 2-10

## Historical Context

### WWI Era (1916-1925)

**Momo Class** (1916): Japan's first modern destroyers with 3×4.7" guns. **Momi Class** (1919): 21 ships providing bulk of destroyer force in 1920s. **Minekaze Class** (1920): 15 ships, 4×4.7" guns, 39 knots—fastest destroyers of their era. **Kamikaze Class** (1922): Improved Minekaze with broader beam. **Mutsuki Class** (1925): First class with **24" (610mm) torpedo tubes**, preparing for the revolutionary Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo.

### Fubuki Revolution (1928-1932)

The **Fubuki "Special Type"** represents one of the most significant advances in destroyer design history:

**Revolutionary Features**:
- **6×5" (127mm) guns** in three twin enclosed turrets (weatherproof!)
- **9× 24" torpedoes** in three triple mounts
- **2,000+ ton displacement** (largest destroyers of the era)
- **34 knots** top speed (50,000 shp)
- **Enclosed turrets**: First destroyers with fully weatherproof gun houses
- **High freeboard**: Excellent seakeeping in Pacific conditions

**Impact**: The Fubuki class shocked Western navies and forced immediate redesigns. Every major navy's interwar destroyer development responded to Fubuki's capabilities. **20 ships** built (1928-1932), becoming the backbone of IJN destroyer flotillas. **Akatsuki Class** (4 ships, 1932-1933) represented refined Fubuki design with lighter machinery.

### Treaty Era (1933-1937)

**Hatsuharu Class** (1933): Reduced design responding to London Naval Treaty limitations (1,700 tons). Top-heavy initially, required modifications. 6 ships featured quad torpedo mounts for first time.

**Shiratsuyu Class** (1936): 10 ships with narrower hull, 5×5" guns, **8× 24" torpedoes** in two quad mounts. Excellent design balancing firepower and seaworthiness.

**Asashio Class** (1937): Return to larger destroyers (2,000+ tons) with **6×5" guns** in three twins, **8× 24" torpedoes** in two quads. 10 ships, considered one of Japan's best destroyer designs—well-balanced and effective.

### Wartime Classes (1938-1945)

**Kagero Class** (1938): 19 ships refining Asashio design. Excellent all-around destroyers with 6×5" guns, 8× Type 93 torpedoes, 35 knots. Served as IJN's standard fleet destroyer throughout WWII.

**Yūgumo Class** (1941): 19 ships, essentially improved Kagero with better AA (25mm guns increased from 4 to 28+). Wartime production prioritized numbers over refinements.

**Shimakaze** (1942): THE ULTIMATE DESTROYER. Experimental "Type C" super-destroyer:
- **Displacement**: 3,300 tons full load
- **Armament**: 6×5" guns (three twins), **15× 24" torpedoes** (three quintuple mounts)—heaviest torpedo armament ever
- **Speed**: **40.9 knots** (75,000 shp)—the fastest destroyer ever built
- **Experimental boilers**: High-temperature, high-pressure design
- Only one completed before program cancelled for resource priorities

**Akizuki Class** (1941): AA destroyer specialists responding to air threat. 12 ships completed:
- **8×3.9" (100mm) guns** in four twin DP mounts (optimized for AA)
- Only **4× 24" torpedoes** (one quad mount)—sacrificed for AA capability
- 33 knots (52,000 shp)
- Excellent AA platforms but expensive and slow to build

## Key Innovations

1. **Fubuki "Special Type"** (1928): Enclosed turrets, 6×5" guns—defined modern destroyer design
2. **Type 93 "Long Lance" Torpedo**: 40 km range, 93% oxygen fuel—deadliest torpedo in WWII
3. **Shimakaze** (1942): 40.9 knots—fastest destroyer ever built, 15× torpedoes
4. **Akizuki Class** (1941): 8×3.9" DP guns—specialized AA destroyers
5. **Quad Torpedo Mounts**: First on Hatsuharu, perfected on later classes
6. **High-Pressure Boilers**: Shimakaze's experimental propulsion (75,000 shp in destroyer!)

## Branch Descriptions

### Fubuki "Special Type" Revolution (1928)

The **Fubuki class** shocked Western navies and forced immediate redesigns worldwide. Revolutionary features:
- **Enclosed turrets**: Weatherproof gun houses (first in world)
- **6×5" guns**: Heaviest destroyer armament of era
- **9× 24" torpedoes**: Preparing for Type 93 "Long Lance"
- **2,000 tons**: Largest destroyers of 1920s

### Shimakaze - The Ultimate Destroyer (1942)

**40.9 knots**—the fastest destroyer ever built. Experimental super-destroyer:
- **15× 24" torpedo tubes**: Heaviest torpedo armament ever
- **75,000 shp**: Experimental high-pressure boilers
- Only one completed—the ultimate expression of IJN destroyer doctrine

## Gameplay Notes

### Balance Considerations

1. **Fubuki as Revolutionary**: +50% capability, defined modern destroyer design
2. **Shimakaze as Ultimate**: 40.9 kts, 15 torpedoes, +100% capability, LEGENDARY
3. **Type 93 Torpedoes**: 40 km range, +60% effectiveness (all ships)
4. **Akizuki AA Focus**: 8×3.9" AA guns, +80% AA capability
5. **Cost Scaling**: Shimakaze very expensive ($5M) reflecting unique status

### Japanese Destroyer Characteristics

**Strengths**:
- **Torpedo Power**: Type 93 "Long Lance" 40 km range, deadliest torpedo
- **Speed**: Fast ships (34-40.9 knots) enabling aggressive tactics
- **Firepower**: Heavy gun armament (6×5" on fleet destroyers)
- **Night Combat**: Excellent training and doctrine (+30% night effectiveness)

**Weaknesses**:
- **Protection**: Light armor, vulnerable to gunfire
- **AA Capability**: Limited AA except Akizuki class
- **Cost**: More expensive than Western destroyers reflecting quality
- **Losses**: High attrition rate in WWII (134 of 169 lost, 79%)
