**Node ID Range**: 1300-1361

## Historical Overview

Japanese torpedo development represents one of WWII's greatest weapons achievements - the **Type 93 "Long Lance"** oxygen torpedo. With 40,000-yard range and 49-51 knot speed, it dominated Pacific naval combat and shocked Allied forces unprepared for its capabilities.

Key Japanese contributions:
- **Oxygen propulsion**: Revolutionary technology giving unprecedented range
- **Large caliber**: 24" (610mm) diameter vs. standard 21" (533mm)
- **Superior range**: Type 93 outranged all Allied torpedoes by 2-3x
- **Surface ship focus**: Unlike other nations emphasizing submarines, Japan prioritized destroyer/cruiser torpedoes
- **Aerial torpedo excellence**: Type 91 devastated Pearl Harbor and dominated early Pacific War

## Legendary & Iconic Torpedoes

### Type 93 "Long Lance" - "The Destroyer King"
**Historical Impact**: **Most feared torpedo of WWII**. Pure oxygen propulsion (vs. compressed air) left almost no wake, 24" diameter, 1,080 lbs warhead, 49-51 knots, **40,000 yard range**. Dominated night battles (Guadalcanal, Java Sea, Philippine Sea). Allied forces didn't believe reports of its range until captured examples examined. Named "Long Lance" by postwar historian Samuel Eliot Morison.

**Technical Innovation**: Pure oxygen propulsion eliminated nitrogen bubbles that create wakes in air/steam torpedoes. Extremely dangerous to manufacture and handle (explosive oxygen), but combat performance justified risks.

**Game Representation**: Tier 9 legendary weapon. Longest range torpedo in game (40,000 yd vs. typical 15,000). Slightly slower than steam (49 kts vs. 50+) but nearly invisible wake. Massive warhead. Iconic destroyer/cruiser weapon that defined IJN surface combat doctrine.

### Type 95 - "Long Lance Submarine Variant"
**Historical Impact**: Submarine version of Type 93 oxygen technology. 21" diameter (standard submarine tubes), 35,000 yard range at 49 knots. Used by I-class submarines with devastating effect. Longest-range submarine torpedo of WWII.

**Game Representation**: Tier 9 submarine oxygen torpedo. Exceptional range for submarine warfare. Enables ultra-long-range attacks unavailable to other nations' submarines.

### Type 91 Modification 2 - "Pearl Harbor Weapon"
**Historical Impact**: Air-launched torpedo that devastated battleship row at Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941). Specially modified with wooden stabilizers for shallow water (40 ft depth vs. typical 75+ ft), allowing attacks in Pearl Harbor's confined anchorage. Also used at Taranto-inspired attacks throughout Pacific.

**Game Representation**: Tier 8 aerial torpedo with shallow running capability. Essential for carrier-based torpedo bomber gameplay. Historical accuracy in Pearl Harbor scenarios.

### Type 97 - "Destroyer Standard"
**Historical Impact**: Pre-Long Lance standard destroyer torpedo. 24" diameter, alcohol-fueled, 52 knots, 20,000 yard range. Excellent performance (outranged Allied torpedoes) but completely overshadowed by Type 93's revolutionary oxygen technology.

**Game Representation**: Tier 7 destroyer torpedo. Bridge between conventional alcohol-fueled torpedoes and oxygen Long Lance. Shows progression of Japanese torpedo superiority.

- 1316 → 1315 (early improvements)
- 1317 → 1316 (full capability Long Lance)
- 1318 → 1317 (wartime optimization)
- 1319 → 1318 (ultimate variant)

### Type 93 "Long Lance" - Full Historical Context
**Development**: Began 1928 under Rear Admiral Kaneji Kishimoto and Captain Toshihide Asakuma. First successful test 1931. Production 1933. Operational secrecy maintained until war's end - Allies didn't understand its capabilities until captured examples examined.

**Combat Record**: Dominated night surface actions:
- **Battle of Java Sea** (Feb 1942): 5 Allied cruisers/destroyers sunk
- **Guadalcanal Naval Battles** (1942-43): Multiple US cruisers sunk
- **Battle of Tassafaronga** (Nov 1942): 1 US cruiser sunk, 3 damaged
- **Battle of Empress Augusta Bay** (Nov 1943): Decisive Japanese advantage

**Technical Superiority**:
- Range: 40,000 yd (Type 93) vs. 15,000 yd (US Mark 15) vs. 13,500 yd (German G7a)
- Speed: 49-51 kts competitive with best Allied torpedoes
- Warhead: 1,080 lbs vs. 643 lbs (Mark 15) vs. 617 lbs (G7a)
- Wake: Near-invisible (pure oxygen combustion) vs. highly visible steam/air wakes

**Weakness**: Secondary explosions - if hit before launch, pure oxygen caused catastrophic ship fires/explosions. Several Japanese cruisers lost due to Type 93 magazines detonating.

### Kaiten - Historical Context
**Desperation Weapon**: Developed late 1944 as war turned against Japan. Modified Type 93 torpedoes with pilot compartment. Pilot manually guided to target, no escape mechanism. **Kamikaze weapon** - one-way mission.

**Combat Record**: Sunk tanker USS Mississinewa (Nov 1944), damaged several ships. But limited effectiveness - ~100 Kaiten deployed, only ~4 successful attacks. Most pilots killed by depth charges before reaching targets. Ultimately another tragic example of Japan's desperation tactics.

**Game Representation**: Included for historical completeness. Tier 9 placement reflects technical capability (Type 93 base) but marked clearly as kamikaze weapons. Very high costs reflect their nature.
