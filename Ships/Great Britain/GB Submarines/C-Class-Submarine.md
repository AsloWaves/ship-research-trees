# C-Class Submarines (1905-1910)

## Overview
The C-class were the final and most numerous petrol-electric submarines, with 38 boats built 1905-1910. They represented the ultimate development of petrol-powered submarine design before the transition to diesel propulsion. The class saw extensive WWI service in home waters, Mediterranean, and Baltic operations, with heavy losses.

## Design

**Refined Petrol Design:**
- Similar to B-class
- Enhanced range (1,500 vs 1,000 nm)
- Improved submerged speed (7 vs 6.5 knots)
- Better reliability
- Mass production (38 boats)

**Key Features:**
- Proven design repeated
- Incremental improvements
- Large production run
- Last petrol submarines

## Boats by Groups

**C1-C10 (1906-1907):**
- Early production
- Home Fleet service

**C11-C20 (1907-1908):**
- Mid-production improvements
- Mediterranean deployment

**C21-C30 (1908-1909):**
- Late production
- Enhanced equipment

**C31-C38 (1909-1910):**
- Final boats
- Best of class
- Some WWI only

## WWI Service

**Major Operations:**
- North Sea patrols
- Mediterranean operations
- Baltic operations (C26, C27, C32, C35)
- Dardanelles campaign
- Adriatic patrols
- Defensive operations

**Baltic Operations:**
- C26, C27, C32, C35 deployed 1916
- Difficult operations
- Extreme conditions
- Limited success

## Losses

**Heavy Casualties: 15 of 38 lost (39%):**

**Combat Losses:**
- C3 - Lost in action, 1915
- C11 - Mined North Sea, 1915
- C16 - Mined North Sea, 1917
- C31 - Mined, 1918
- C33 - Lost in action, 1915
- C34 - Mined, 1917

**Accidental Losses:**
- C1 - Collision, 1909
- C7 - Mined (own mines), 1917
- C17 - Collision, 1917
- C29 - Collision, 1915

**Baltic Losses:**
- C26, C27, C32, C35 - Scuttled to prevent capture, April 1918 (Russian Revolution)

## Notable Actions

**Mediterranean Service:**
- Dardanelles operations
- Adriatic patrols
- Anti-submarine patrols
- Support operations

**Baltic Adventure:**
- 4 boats deployed 1916
- All scuttled 1918 (Russian collapse)
- Extreme operating conditions
- Pioneering operations

## Fate

**Post-WWI:**
- Survivors scrapped 1919-1922
- Obsolete by armistice
- Replaced by modern types
- 10-15 year service lives

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Ultimate petrol submarine
- Mass production successful
- Combat proven
- Heavy loss rate

**Historical Significance:**
- Most numerous petrol class (38 boats)
- Extensive WWI service
- Baltic operations pioneering
- Last petrol submarines

**Operational Impact:**
- Widespread deployment
- Proven coastal defense
- Heavy losses highlighted limitations
- Led to diesel transition

**Lessons Learned:**
- Petrol too dangerous
- Better range needed
- Diesel essential
- Influenced D-class development
