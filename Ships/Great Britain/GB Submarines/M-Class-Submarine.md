# M-Class Submarines (1917-1918)

## Overview
The M-class were experimental monitor submarines with 3 boats built 1917-1918. Designed with massive 12-inch guns for shore bombardment, they were the only submarines ever built with battleship-caliber main armament. The class represented an attempt to create submarine monitors, but the concept proved impractical and was not repeated.

## Design

**Unique Concept:**
- Only submarines with battleship-caliber guns
- 12-inch Mk IX gun (salvaged from pre-dreadnought battleships)
- Gun mounted forward of conning tower
- Large size to accommodate massive armament
- Shore bombardment role

**Key Features:**
- 12-inch gun with 40 rounds
- Fixed mounting (aim by positioning submarine)
- Four bow torpedo tubes
- Large crew (60 men)
- Experimental design

**Design Philosophy:**
- Submarine monitor concept
- Shore bombardment capability
- Combine stealth with heavy firepower
- Experimental innovation
- Never repeated

## Boats

1. **M1** - 1918, lost 1925
2. **M2** - 1918, converted to aircraft carrier submarine, lost 1932
3. **M3** - 1918, converted to minelayer submarine, scrapped 1932

## WWI Service

**Limited War Service:**
- Commissioned late 1918
- Post-armistice deployment
- Experimental operations
- No combat use
- Concept trials

## Post-War Modifications

**M2 Aircraft Carrier Conversion (1925-1927):**
- 12-inch gun removed
- Hangar and catapult fitted
- Carried Parnall Peto seaplane
- Unique aircraft carrier submarine
- Lost 1932 with all hands (hangar door failure)

**M3 Minelayer Conversion (1927):**
- 12-inch gun removed
- Minelaying equipment installed
- 100 mines capacity
- Successful conversion
- Scrapped 1932

## Losses

**High Loss Rate: 2 of 3 lost (67%):**

**Post-War Losses:**
- **M1** - Collision with Swedish ship Vidar, 1925 (69 killed)
- **M2** - Sank in English Channel, 1932 (60 killed, hangar door failure during diving)

**Survivor:**
- **M3** - Only survivor, scrapped 1932

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Unique experimental design
- Concept impractical
- 12-inch gun difficult to use
- Too specialized
- Never repeated

**Historical Significance:**
- Only battleship-gun submarines
- M2 only aircraft carrier submarine (until WWII Japanese)
- Experimental innovation
- Design dead-end
- Technological curiosity

**Operational Impact:**
- Limited practical value
- Conversion to other roles more successful
- Shore bombardment concept abandoned
- Submarine monitors impractical
- Lessons learned for future designs

**Design Influence:**
- Concept not repeated
- Demonstrated submarine size limits
- Led to more practical designs
- Minelayer conversion (M3) more successful
- Aircraft carrier concept (M2) ahead of its time
