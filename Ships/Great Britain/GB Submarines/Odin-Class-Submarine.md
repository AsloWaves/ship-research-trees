# Odin-Class Submarines (1928-1929)

## Overview
The Odin-class were interwar patrol submarines with 9 boats built 1928-1929. They were the first post-WWI patrol submarine design, featuring improved habitability and range for overseas operations. The class saw extensive WWII service with heavy losses, particularly in the Mediterranean.

## Design

**First Post-WWI Patrol Design:**
- Improved habitability for long patrols
- Excellent surface range (8,500 nm)
- Eight 21-inch torpedo tubes
- Overseas deployment capable
- Diesel-electric propulsion

**Key Features:**
- Good surface speed (17.5 knots)

## Boats

1. **Odin** - 1929, lost 1940
2. **Olympus** - 1929, lost 1942
3. **Orpheus** - 1929, lost 1940
4. **Osiris** - 1929, survived war
5. **Oswald** - 1929, lost 1940
6. **Otus** - 1929, survived war
7. **Otway** - 1929, transferred to RAN, survived war
8. **Oxley** - 1929, lost 1939 (friendly fire)
9. **Grampus** - 1932, lost 1940

## Interwar Service

**Peacetime Deployment:**
- Mediterranean Fleet
- Far East deployments
- Home Fleet operations
- Training duties
- Overseas patrols

**Foreign Transfer:**
- **Otway** - Transferred to Royal Australian Navy
- Mediterranean service
- Far East patrols
- Colonial deployments

## WWII Service

**Extensive War Operations:**
- Mediterranean patrols
- North Sea operations
- Norwegian campaign
- Malta convoys
- Anti-shipping patrols

**Major Actions:**
- Mediterranean anti-shipping
- Norway operations 1940
- Malta supply runs
- Reconnaissance missions
- Combat patrols

## Losses

**Catastrophic Loss Rate: 7 of 9 lost (78%):**

**1939:**
- **Oxley** - Sunk by HMS Triton (friendly fire), September 1939 (first British submarine lost WWII)

**1940:**
- **Odin** - Depth charged by Italian destroyers, June 1940
- **Orpheus** - Mined off Tobruk, June 1940
- **Grampus** - Depth charged by Italian destroyers, June 1940
- **Oswald** - Depth charged by Italian destroyers, August 1940

**1942:**
- **Olympus** - Mined off Malta, May 1942 (89 killed)

**High Loss Rate:**
- Mediterranean operations deadly
- Anti-submarine warfare effective
- Mining hazards severe
- Only 2 survived WWII

## Post-War Fate

**Survivors:**
- **Osiris** - Scrapped 1946
- **Otus** - Scrapped 1946
- **Otway** (RAN) - Scrapped 1945
