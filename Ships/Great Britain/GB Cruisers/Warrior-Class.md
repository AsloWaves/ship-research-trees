## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Powerful armored cruiser design
- Good firepower and protection
- Too slow for battlecruiser role
- Vulnerable in fleet action

**Combat Lessons:**
- Two lost at Jutland demonstrated vulnerability
- Armored cruisers obsolete for fleet battle
- Should not engage battleships
- Defence's aggressive action criticized

**Historical Significance:**
- Defence loss dramatic (magazine explosion)
- Warrior survived battle but sank
- Last British armored cruiser losses in action
- Demonstrated need for battlecruisers instead
