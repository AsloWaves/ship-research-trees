**First Modern Light Cruisers** - Tenryu-class were Japan's first modern light cruisers. 2 ships commissioned 1919. Designed as destroyer flotilla leaders. 4,350 tons, 33 knots, 4× 140mm guns, 6× 21-inch torpedoes. Bridge between old protected cruisers and modern 5,500-ton series (Kuma/Nagara/Sendai). Experimental/prototype class - lessons learned → 5,500-ton design. Both ships fought entire WWII. Both lost in action (100% casualty rate). Tenryu torpedoed December 1942, Tatsuta March 1944. Small but influential class - pioneered Japanese light cruiser concept.

**Key Specs:** 3,230/4,350 tons | 463ft | 33 kn | 4× 140mm + 6× 21-inch torpedoes | 2 ships | Both lost

**Innovation:** **First modern Japanese light cruisers** (1919). Revolutionary concept: Purpose-built destroyer flotilla leaders (not converted old cruisers). Designed for: High speed (33 knots - keep up with destroyers), scout for fleet, lead destroyer torpedo attacks. Moderate size (4,350 tons - smaller than later 5,500-ton). Four 140mm guns (single mounts - same caliber as later cruisers). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes (heavy torpedo armament for cruiser). Mixed propulsion (oil + coal - transitional technology). Light armor (2.5-inch belt - speed priority). **Experimental class** - only 2 ships built (test concept before mass production). Success → led to Kuma-class (5 ships, 1920-1921) with refined design. Tenryu/Tatsuta: Prototypes that proved destroyer leader concept worked.

**Design:** Compact light cruiser hull (463 ft, 4,350 tons). Four 140mm Type 3 guns: single mounts (2 forward, 2 aft). Open mounts (no turrets). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes: two triple mounts (centerline). One 80mm AA gun (minimal - 1919 design). Light armor: 2.5-inch belt, 1-inch deck (protect against destroyer guns only). Three funnels (distinctive profile). Ten Kampon boilers (mixed oil/coal - transitional). Steam turbines (51,000 shp). Three shafts (unusual - later ships 2 or 4 shafts). 33 knots (good for 1919, adequate for destroyer leadership). Range 5,000 nm at 14 knots. Crew 332 (small for cruiser). Mine rails (could lay mines). Simple, economical design. Bridge structure: Compact, designed for flotilla command.

**Ships (2 built - BOTH LOST):**

1. **Tenryu** - Commissioned November 20, 1919
   - Lead ship, name means "Heavenly Dragon"
   - First modern Japanese light cruiser
   - Prototype for 5,500-ton series
   - Early WWII: China, Philippines, Dutch East Indies
   - Guadalcanal campaign (1942)
   - Lost: December 18, 1942, north of Madang (New Guinea)
   - Torpedoed by US submarine Albacore
   - Ship sank quickly
   - 285 killed (most of crew)
   - First Tenryu-class loss

2. **Tatsuta** - Commissioned March 31, 1919
   - "Tatsuta River"
   - Actually commissioned BEFORE Tenryu (but Tenryu was lead/name ship)
   - Early WWII: Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Solomons
   - Guadalcanal campaign
   - 1943-1944: Convoy escort duties
   - Lost: March 13, 1944, off Yokosuka (Japan!)
   - Torpedoed by US submarine Sandlance
   - **Sunk near home waters** (tragic - survived most of war)
   - 367 killed (heavy casualties)
   - Last Tenryu-class loss

**Construction:**

- **Builders:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal (both ships)
- **Design:** Japanese indigenous (influenced by British designs)
- **Laid down:** 1917 (both ships)
- **Launched:** 1918 (both ships)
- **Commissioned:** 1919 (Tatsuta March, Tenryu November)
- **Cost:** ~¥5-6 million each (1919 yen)
- **Why only 2:** Experimental class - test destroyer leader concept

**Service History:**

**1919-1941 (Peacetime):**
- Tatsuta commissioned March 1919 (first)
- Tenryu commissioned November 1919
- Fleet exercises (destroyer flotilla leadership)
- China operations (1920s-1930s)
- Modernization 1930s:
  - AA guns increased
  - Fire control improved
  - Minimal upgrades (small ships, limited potential)
- By 1941: Old (22 years), small, but needed

**December 1941 (War Begins):**
- **Philippines**: Both ships supported operations
- **Dutch East Indies**: Participated in invasions
- **Convoy escort**: Protected invasion forces

**1942 (Heavy Combat):**
- **Dutch East Indies Campaign** (January-March 1942):
  - Both ships active
  - Escort operations
  - Battle of Java Sea area (February-March)
- **Guadalcanal Campaign** (August 1942-February 1943):
  - Both ships involved
  - "Tokyo Express" runs (fast supply missions)
  - Destroyer escort
- **December 18, 1942**: **Tenryu LOST**
  - North of Madang, New Guinea
  - Torpedoed by USS Albacore (submarine)
  - Sank quickly, 285 killed
  - **First loss** (50% of class gone!)

**1943-1944 (Tatsuta Continues Alone):**
- **Tatsuta** (sole survivor):
  - Convoy escort duties
  - Reduced to secondary missions (old, small)
  - Training operations
  - Japan-based mostly
- **March 13, 1944**: **Tatsuta LOST**
  - Off Yokosuka (near Tokyo - home waters!)
  - Torpedoed by USS Sandlance (submarine)
  - Sank with heavy casualties (367 killed)
  - **Last Tenryu-class** destroyed
  - **Class extinct** (both ships lost, 100% casualty rate)

**100% Loss Rate - Both Lost:**

**Complete Class Annihilation:**
- 2 ships built
- 2 ships lost
- 0 survivors (100%)

**Both to Submarines:**
- Tenryu: USS Albacore (December 1942)
- Tatsuta: USS Sandlance (March 1944)
- Shows US submarine dominance

**Why All Lost:**
1. **Old ships**: 22-25 years old by WWII (worn out)
2. **Small size**: 4,350 tons (smaller than 5,500-ton cruisers, less survivable)
3. **Light armor**: 2.5-inch belt useless vs torpedoes
4. **Entire war service**: Both fought 1941-1942/1944 (maximum exposure)
5. **Convoy escort**: Vulnerable role (predictable routes, submarine targets)
6. **No retirement**: Needed every hull (fleet shrinking)

**Prototype for 5,500-Ton Series:**

**Experimental Purpose:**
- Tenryu-class: Test destroyer flotilla leader concept
- Only 2 ships built (proof of concept)
- Evaluate: Speed, armament, size requirements

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Concept works**: Flotilla leaders successful
2. **Size too small**: 4,350 tons cramped for command/crew
3. **Need more guns**: 4× 140mm adequate but could be better
4. **Speed good**: 33 knots sufficient
5. **Mixed fuel inefficient**: Coal+oil complicated, go all-oil

**Applied to Kuma-Class (1920-1921):**
- **Larger**: 5,832 tons (34% bigger than Tenryu)
- **More guns**: 7× 140mm (vs Tenryu's 4)
- **Faster**: 36 knots (vs 33 knots)
- **All-oil**: No coal (simpler, cleaner, more efficient)
- **More ships**: 5 built (vs 2 - proven concept, mass produce)

**Then Nagara (6 ships), Sendai (3 ships):**
- Total 5,500-ton series: 14 ships (Kuma 5 + Nagara 6 + Sendai 3)
- All based on lessons from Tenryu prototype

**Tenryu → 5,500-ton series = successful prototype → production**

**First Modern Destroyer Leaders:**

**Revolutionary Concept (1919):**
- **Before Tenryu**: Old cruisers used as flotilla leaders (slow, obsolete)
- **Tenryu innovation**: Purpose-built for role
  - Fast enough (33 knots) to keep up with destroyers (35-39 knots)
  - Command facilities (signals, communications, staff space)
  - Firepower to support destroyers (4× 140mm guns)
  - Heavy torpedoes (6 tubes - participate in destroyer attacks)

**Flotilla Leader Role:**
1. **Scout for fleet**: High speed, good range, search enemy
2. **Lead destroyer attacks**: Command destroyer flotillas in torpedo attacks
3. **Screen fleet**: Protect battleships from enemy destroyers/submarines
4. **Fast raids**: Hit-and-run attacks on enemy positions
5. **Convoy escort**: Protect merchant ships (later in war)

**Influenced Global Designs:**
- British: Built scout cruisers same era (similar concept)
- US: Omaha-class (1920s) larger destroyer leaders
- Japan continued: 5,500-ton series refined concept

**Tatsuta's Fate - Tragic Irony:**

**Survived Most of War:**
- Commissioned March 1919
- Fought: Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Guadalcanal (1941-1943)
- Survived 2+ years of war (sister Tenryu lost December 1942)
- By 1944: One of oldest cruisers still afloat

**March 13, 1944:**
- Off Yokosuka (near Tokyo)
- **Home waters** (supposedly safer than frontlines)
- Torpedoed by USS Sandlance
- Sank with 367 killed (most of crew)

**Irony:**
- Survived brutal Guadalcanal campaign
- Survived Dutch East Indies operations
- Survived 2+ years frontline combat
- **Killed near home** by submarine in "safe" waters
- Shows: No safe areas by 1944, US submarines everywhere

**Comparison - Early Japanese Light Cruisers:**

| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | Speed | Guns | Torpedoes | Role | Lost |
|-------|-------|------|------|-------|------|-----------|------|------|
| **Tenryu** | **2** | **1919** | **4,350** | **33 kn** | **4× 140mm** | **6× 533mm** | **Prototype** | **2 (100%)** |
| Kuma | 5 | 1920-21 | 5,832 | 36 kn | 7× 140mm | 8× 610mm | Production | 4 (80%) |
| Nagara | 6 | 1922-25 | 5,832 | 36 kn | 7× 140mm | 8× 610mm | Improved | 6 (100%) |
| Sendai | 3 | 1924-25 | 5,832 | 35.5 kn | 7× 140mm | 8× 610mm | Final | 3 (100%) |

**Tenryu: Smallest, slowest, oldest - but pioneered the series**

**Legacy:** Tenryu-class pioneered Japan's modern light cruiser concept. 2 ships (1919) first purpose-built destroyer flotilla leaders. Experimental/prototype class - only 2 built to test concept. Success led to 5,500-ton series (14 ships: Kuma + Nagara + Sendai). Tenryu/Tatsuta: Smaller (4,350 tons), slower (33 knots), fewer guns (4× 140mm) than successors but proved concept worked. Both fought entire WWII. Both lost to US submarines (100% casualty rate). Tenryu: December 1942 (USS Albacore). Tatsuta: March 1944 (USS Sandlance, near Tokyo - tragic irony). Despite losses, class successful - prototype that spawned entire cruiser series. Tenryu-class: Small but influential, complete sacrifice.

**Historical Significance:** Tenryu-class marked Japan's transition to modern light cruiser design. First purpose-built destroyer flotilla leaders (1919) - revolutionary concept vs using old cruisers. Showed Japanese forward thinking: Build specialized ships for specific roles. Only 2 built (experimental) - test before mass production (smart approach). Success → 5,500-ton series: Kuma (5 ships, 1920), Nagara (6, 1922-1925), Sendai (3, 1924-1925) = 14 total refined from Tenryu lessons. Evolution visible: Tenryu 4,350 tons, 4 guns, 33 knots → Kuma 5,832 tons, 7 guns, 36 knots = 34% larger, 75% more firepower, 9% faster. Both Tenryu lost (100%) to submarines - shows vulnerability of light armor cruisers vs underwater threat. Tatsuta's fate particularly tragic: Survived Guadalcanal, Dutch East Indies, 2+ years war, killed near Tokyo March 1944. By WWII, 25-year-old ships obsolete but desperately needed. Contrast: Built 1919 for destroyer leadership vs 1944 convoy escort (role degradation). Small class (2 ships) but huge impact: Pioneered design philosophy, spawned 14-ship series, influenced all subsequent Japanese light cruisers. Tenryu-class: Forgotten prototypes that changed Japanese naval architecture.
