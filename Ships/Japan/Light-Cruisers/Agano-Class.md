**Modern Light Cruisers** - Agano-class were last IJN light cruisers, designed as destroyer flotilla leaders. 4 ships completed 1942-1944. Six 6-inch guns + eight 24-inch torpedoes. High speed (35 knots). All four lost 1944-1946 (three in combat, Sakawa at Bikini Atoll atomic tests). Yahagi escorted Yamato on final mission (Operation Ten-Go).

**Key Specs:** 6,652/8,534 tons | 570ft | 35 kn | 6× 152mm + 4× 76mm AA + 32-61× 25mm AA + 8× 610mm torpedoes | 60mm belt | 4 ships

**Innovation:** Modern light cruiser design for late war. Destroyer flotilla leader concept - lead destroyer squadrons in night actions. Balanced armament for surface and AA combat. Six 6-inch guns (reduced from older classes). Heavy AA armament for 1942+. Eight Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes. High speed (35 knots) for fleet operations. Radar-equipped (Type 21, Type 13). Last IJN light cruisers completed - no successors due to war priorities.

**Design:** Three twin 6-inch turrets (two forward superfiring, one aft). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers amidships. Heavy AA battery (32-61× 25mm). High speed (35 knots) for destroyer operations. Light armor (2.4-inch belt). Two floatplanes with catapult. Radar-equipped. Good range (6,000 nm). Mine-laying capability (48 mines). Designed for night surface actions and AA defense. Emphasis on speed and firepower over protection.

**Comparison - Late-War Light Cruisers:**
| Class | Nation | Ships | Tonnage | Main Guns | Speed | AA Guns |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Agano** | **Japan** | **4** | **6,652** | **6× 6"** | **35 kn** | **32-61× 25mm** |
| Atlanta | USA | 11 | 6,000 | 16× 5" DP | 32.5 kn | 16× 5" DP |
| Cleveland | USA | 27 | 10,000 | 12× 6" | 32.5 kn | 12× 5" DP |

**Destroyer Flotilla Leader Concept:**
- Lead destroyer squadrons in night actions
- Flagship for destroyer division commander
- Provide additional firepower for destroyer force
- Coordination and communications center
- Speed matched to destroyers (35 knots)
- Heavy torpedo armament for surface actions

**Wartime Service:**
- All four commissioned after Guadalcanal campaign
- Missed early war carrier battles
- Participated in late-war defensive battles
- Heavy attrition 1944-1945
- None survived past 1946

**Legacy:** Agano-class represented last IJN light cruiser design. Modern destroyer-leader concept balanced firepower, speed, and AA defense. All four lost in various ways - submarine (Agano), air attack (Noshiro, Yahagi), nuclear test (Sakawa). Yahagi's participation in Yamato's final mission symbolic - escorted battleship to destruction. Sakawa unique fate - only IJN cruiser present at atomic tests. Short service lives (1-3 years combat) showed desperate final years. Design sound but arrived too late to influence war. Names: Rivers in Japan - Agano, Noshiro, Yahagi, Sakawa.

**Historical Significance:** Agano-class embodied late-war IJN cruiser design - reduced main battery, increased AA. Too few and too late to affect war outcome. Yahagi's sacrifice escorting Yamato symbolized IJN's end - modern cruiser and super battleship both destroyed by overwhelming air power. Sakawa's nuclear test fate ironic - survived combat only to be destroyed by atomic bomb. Last light cruisers completed by Japan - cruiser era ended with these four ships. Design showed lessons learned but insufficient resources and time to build more. Represented transition from surface-centric to air-centric naval warfare.
