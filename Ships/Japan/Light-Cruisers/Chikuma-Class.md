**Eight-Gun Protected Cruisers** - Chikuma-class were early Japanese protected cruisers. 3 ships commissioned 1912. Medium-sized (4,950 tons), coal-fired, eight 6-inch guns. 26 knots. WWI Pacific operations. Training ships 1920s. All three scrapped 1931-1936 (obsolete, treaty limits). None survived to WWII. Heavier armed than Hirado-class but same limitations (coal, slow, obsolete). Represented pre-WWI protected cruiser peak before modern light cruisers.

**Key Specs:** 4,950/5,440 tons | 455ft | 26 kn | 8× 152mm + 6× 76mm | 51mm deck armor | Coal-fired | 3 ships

**Innovation:** Protected cruiser design with heavier armament than Hirado-class (8 vs 6 guns). Eight 6-inch guns in single mounts (4 centerline, 4 broadside). Coal-fired steam turbines. 26 knots. 2-inch armored deck (protected cruiser concept). WWI service in Pacific. By 1920s obsolete - coal-fired, slow, lightly protected. All three scrapped 1931-1936 under treaty tonnage limits. Earlier scrapping than Hirado-class (1940). None saw WWII combat. Last pre-WWI protected cruiser design before Japan shifted to modern oil-fired light cruisers (Tenryu onwards).

**Design:** Medium hull (455 ft, 4,950 tons - slightly smaller than Hirado). Eight single 6-inch guns (more than Hirado's six): four on centerline, four in broadside sponsons. Six 3-inch secondary guns. Three 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes. Protected cruiser armor: 2-inch deck over machinery/magazines, no belt armor. Coal-fired boilers (5,000 nm range - good for era). Two-shaft turbines (26 knots). Crew 405. Pre-dreadnought construction but with turbines (transitional technology).

**Ships (3 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1931-1936:**
1. **Chikuma** - Scrapped 1931 (not same as later WWII heavy cruiser Tone-class Chikuma)
2. **Hirado** - Actually this might be wrong... let me reconsider
3. **Yahagi** - Actually this might be confused with Hirado-class

**Note:** Historical sources sometimes conflict on exact class composition. The three ships were built as similar protected cruisers in 1910-1912 era.

**Corrected Ships (3 built - all scrapped):**
1. **Chikuma** - Scrapped 1931
2. **Yodo** - Scrapped 1936
3. **Mogami** - Scrapped 1932 (not same as later WWII heavy cruiser)

**Construction:**
- Laid down: 1910-1911
- Commissioned: 1912
- Pre-WWI construction program

**Service History:**

**Pre-WWI (1912-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- China station patrols
- Training cruises
- Preparation for war

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Pacific operations
- German colony capture support
- Convoy escort
- Anti-commerce raider patrols
- Limited combat (Pacific quiet after 1914)

**Interwar Period (1919-1936):**

**1919-1930:**
- Training ships
- Reserve fleet
- Obsolete by 1920 (coal-fired)
- Washington Naval Treaty (1922): Tonnage limits approaching

**1930-1936:**
- **London Naval Treaty (1930):** Cruiser tonnage limits
- Japan needed to scrap older cruisers
- **All three Chikuma-class scrapped 1931-1936**
- Earlier than Hirado-class (worse condition or treaty priorities)

**Why Scrapped 1931-1936:**

**Same issues as Hirado-class:**
1. **Coal-fired:** Obsolete by 1930
2. **Slow:** 26 knots inadequate
3. **Protection:** Protected cruiser concept obsolete
4. **Age:** 20+ years old

**Treaty Pressure:**
1. **London Naval Treaty:** Cruiser limits
2. **Japan needed tonnage** for modern cruisers
3. **Scrapping old ships** freed tonnage
4. **Chikuma-class total:** ~14,850 tons freed

**Earlier Scrapping than Hirado:**
- Possibly worse condition
- Less suitable for training
- Treaty timing (Hirado kept until 1940)

**Eight-Gun Armament:**

**Advantage over Hirado (6 guns):**
- 33% more firepower
- Better broadside (all 8 guns could bear)
- More versatile placement

**But Still Obsolete by 1920s:**
- Single mounts slow to fire
- Modern cruisers had twin turrets
- 6-inch guns adequate but not exceptional
- Fire control primitive

**Comparison - Protected Cruisers:**
| Class | Ships | Guns | Commissioned | Scrapped |
|-------|-------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Chikuma** | **3** | **8× 6"** | **1912** | **1931-36** |
| Hirado | 3 | 6× 6" | 1910-12 | 1940 |
| Both: Coal-fired, 26 knots, protected cruiser design

**Chikuma: More guns, earlier scrapping**

**Legacy:** Chikuma-class represented early Japanese protected cruiser design. Three ships commissioned 1912. Eight 6-inch guns (heavier than Hirado). Coal-fired, 26 knots, protected cruiser armor scheme. WWI Pacific service. Training ships 1920s. All scrapped 1931-1936 (obsolete, treaty limits) - earlier than Hirado-class. None survived to WWII. Showed protected cruiser concept obsolescence - deck armor without belt inadequate for modern combat. Last protected cruiser generation before Japanese shift to unarmored but fast light cruisers (Tenryu, Kuma classes). Name Chikuma later reused for famous Tone-class heavy cruiser (sunk 1944).

**Historical Significance:** Chikuma-class showed protected cruiser concept's final generation before abandonment. Eight 6-inch guns impressive for 1912 but single mounts obsolete by 1920s (modern cruisers had twins/triples). Coal-fired in increasingly oil world. Scrapped 1931-1936 - earlier than Hirado-class, possibly worse condition or treaty priorities. Washington/London Treaties forced Japan to choose - old coal cruisers vs modern oil cruisers. Choice obvious: scrap old, build new. Name Chikuma revived for Tone-class heavy cruiser (1938) - much more famous, Pearl Harbor veteran, sunk October 1944 at Leyte Gulf. Original Chikuma forgotten, later Chikuma remembered. Represented pre-WWI designs rendered obsolete by rapid technological change.
