**The Command Ship** - Oyodo was a unique light cruiser designed as submarine flotilla command ship. 1 ship commissioned 1943. Only six 6.1-inch guns (two triple turrets) but six reconnaissance floatplanes. Powerful AA (8× 100mm DP + 52× 25mm). High speed (35 knots), long range (10,000 nm). Used as fleet command ship instead of submarine command. Survived until July 28, 1945 - last IJN cruiser sunk (Kure raid).

**Key Specs:** 8,164/11,433 tons | 631ft | 35 kn | 6× 155mm + 8× 100mm DP + 52× 25mm AA + 6 floatplanes | 50mm belt | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Purpose-designed submarine flotilla command ship. Large enough for admiral's staff (970 crew including staff). Six floatplanes for scouting (more than any cruiser). Two catapults. Minimal main armament (only six 6.1-inch guns in two turrets) - command, not combat. Heavy AA for 1943 (8× 100mm DP + 52× 25mm). High speed (35 knots) to keep up with fleet. Long range (10,000 nm) for Pacific operations. Never used as submarine command - became fleet flagship instead. Last cruiser sunk (July 28, 1945, Kure raid).

**Design:** Unique layout for command role. **Two triple 155mm turrets** (one forward, one aft) - minimal for cruiser. Heavy AA: Eight 100mm DP guns + 52× 25mm. **Six floatplanes** (two catapults amidships). Large superstructure for command facilities. Extensive communications equipment. Four-shaft propulsion (35 knots). Good armor for light cruiser (2-inch belt). Long, sleek hull (631 ft). Spacious quarters for staff. Designed around communication and reconnaissance, not firepower.

**Ship:**
- **Oyodo** - Sunk July 28, 1945 (Operation Crossroads air raid, Kure), ~190 killed

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** February 14, 1941
- **Launched:** April 2, 1942
- **Commissioned:** February 28, 1943

**Service History:**

**Design Purpose (never fulfilled):**
- Command ship for submarine flotilla
- Coordinate long-range submarine operations
- Six floatplanes for reconnaissance
- Find targets, direct submarines
- But: By 1943, submarine warfare less emphasized

**Actual Service (1943-1945):**

**1943 - Work-up and Training:**
- Commissioned February 1943
- Training off Japan
- Staff familiarization
- Testing aircraft operations

**1943-1944 - Fleet Service:**
- Never used for submarine command
- **Used as fleet flagship instead**
- Admiral Ozawa's staff aboard (various times)
- Communications and command ship

**June 1944 - Battle of Philippine Sea:**
- Part of Mobile Fleet
- Admiral Ozawa's temporary flagship
- Survived both days of battle
- Ship undamaged despite massive US air strikes

**October 1944 - Battle of Leyte Gulf:**
- Part of Northern Force (decoy carriers)
- Ozawa's flagship (shifted to Zuikaku after Taiho sank earlier)
- Survived battle
- Withdrew with remnants of fleet

**1945 - Final Months:**
- Operating from Kure Naval Base
- Limited fuel prevented operations
- Heavy AA made her valuable for base defense
- Moored at Kure

**July 28, 1945 - Sinking:**
*Operation Crossroads - Kure Raid*

**Background:**
- Final major US carrier raid on Japan
- Target: Kure Naval Base (major warships)
- Oyodo moored at Kure
- July 24-28, 1945: Multiple raids

**July 28, 1945:**
- **Massive US carrier strike** (1,000+ aircraft)
- Targets: Yamato (already sunk April), Ise, Hyuga, Haruna, cruisers

**Oyodo's Attack:**
- **Attacked by dive bombers and torpedo bombers**
- Multiple bomb hits
- At least one torpedo hit
- Heavy AA fire shot down several attackers
- But overwhelming numbers

**Fatal Damage:**
- Fires throughout ship
- Flooding from torpedo hit
- **Capsized at pier**
- **~190 killed, 780+ survivors** (most crew ashore)
- Ship moored, so rescue easier

**Significance:**
- **Last IJN cruiser sunk in WWII**
- Only 18 days before surrender (August 15)
- Symbolic end - newest cruiser type, last to die

**Why Last Cruiser Sunk:**
- Commissioned February 1943 - relatively new
- Survived Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf
- Heavy AA (52× 25mm) provided good defense
- Luck in multiple battles
- Final location (Kure) proved fatal - concentrated target

**155mm/60 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Longer barrel than standard 155mm
- **Caliber:** 155mm (6.1 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 27,400 meters (30,000 yards)
- **Rate of fire:** 5-6 rounds per minute
- **Shell weight:** 55.87 kg (123 lbs)
- Only 6 guns (minimal for 8,000-ton cruiser)

**100mm/65 Type 98 AA Gun:**
- Advanced AA gun for 1943
- **Caliber:** 100mm (3.9 inches)
- **Maximum ceiling:** 13,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 15-19 rounds per minute
- **Dual-purpose:** Anti-air and anti-surface
- 8 guns in four twin mounts

**Floatplane Complement:**
- **6× floatplanes total** (most on any cruiser)
- Types carried:
  - Aichi E13A "Jake" reconnaissance
  - Mitsubishi F1M "Pete" observation
  - Nakajima E8N reconnaissance (early)
- **Two catapults** amidships
- Large hangar for 6 aircraft
- Extensive maintenance facilities

**Comparison - Unique Cruisers:**
| Ship | Nation | Role | Main Guns | Aircraft | Fate |
|------|--------|------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Oyodo** | **Japan** | **Command** | **6× 6.1"** | **6** | **Sunk July 1945** |
| Atlanta | USA | AA cruiser | 16× 5" DP | 0 | 7 of 11 sunk |
| Dido | UK | AA cruiser | 10× 5.25" DP | 0 | 3 of 16 sunk |

**Why Only 6 Main Guns:**
**Design Trade-offs:**
- Command ship, not combat cruiser
- Space needed for:
  - Admiral's staff quarters
  - Communications center
  - Operations center
  - Aircraft hangar (6 planes)
  - Extensive radar/radio
- Heavy AA priority over main guns
- Role: Coordinate, not fight

**Kure Raid Context (July 24-28, 1945):**
*Final destruction of IJN*

**Targets Sunk:**
- **Battleships:** Haruna, Ise (beached), Hyuga (beached)
- **Heavy cruisers:** Tone, Aoba (beached)
- **Light cruisers:** Oyodo
- **Carriers:** Amagi, Katsuragi (damaged)
- **Destroyers/escorts:** Multiple

**Significance:**
- Virtual end of IJN surface fleet
- 18 days before surrender
- Symbolic destruction at home ports
- Oyodo: Last cruiser to die

**If Used As Designed:**
*Submarine flotilla command ship*

**Intended Operations:**
- Base at forward position (Truk, Rabaul)
- Launch 6 floatplanes for reconnaissance
- Locate enemy convoys, warships
- Radio coordinates to submarine fleet
- Coordinate wolf pack attacks
- Recover pilots, relay intel

**Why Never Used This Way:**
- By 1943, submarine campaign not priority
- US ASW too effective
- Japanese submarine tactics poor
- Fleet needed command ships more
- Aircraft carriers made floatplane scouts less useful

**Legacy:** Oyodo represented unique Japanese approach - specialized command ship with minimal firepower but maximum reconnaissance (6 floatplanes) and communications. Designed for submarine command, used as fleet flagship. Survived Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf (1944). Last IJN cruiser sunk (July 28, 1945, Kure raid) - only 18 days before surrender. Heavy AA (52× 25mm) fought to end. Capsized at pier after bomb and torpedo hits. Showed Japanese willingness to design specialized ships for specific roles. Never used as intended but served well as substitute flagship. Name: Oyodo River.

**Historical Significance:** Oyodo epitomized specialized design never used as intended. Built as submarine flotilla command ship (6 floatplanes, extensive communications) but used as fleet flagship. By 1943, Japanese submarine campaign struggling - US ASW too effective, Japanese tactics poor. Oyodo's intended role obsolete before commissioning. Pressed into service as fleet command ship instead - worked well (35 knots, good range, extensive facilities). Survived two major carrier battles (Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf). Fate sealed at Kure - last major raid (July 28, 1945), overwhelmed by 1,000+ aircraft. Last cruiser sunk, 18 days before surrender. Symbolic end: Newest cruiser design type, newest major cruiser, lasted until final days. Showed Japanese specialty ship design philosophy but also showed shifting priorities made specialized designs obsolete quickly.
