**Meiji Era Veterans** - Naniwa-class were Japan's first modern cruisers. 2 ships commissioned 1886-1887. British-built by Armstrong (Newcastle). 3,650 tons, coal-fired compound engines, 18 knots. Two 10.2-inch guns + six 6-inch. Protected cruiser design (deck armor only). Sino-Japanese War veterans (1894-1895). Russo-Japanese War service (1904-1905). Both scrapped 1912 (26 years old, obsolete). Represented Meiji-era naval modernization - Japan buying British warships to build modern fleet.

**Key Specs:** 3,650/4,100 tons | 300ft | 18 kn | 2× 260mm + 6× 152mm | 76mm deck armor | Coal compound engines | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First modern Japanese cruisers (Meiji-era modernization). British-designed and built by Armstrong Whitworth (famous British shipbuilder). Protected cruiser concept: 3-inch armored deck over machinery/magazines, no belt armor. Two 10.2-inch guns (heavy for cruiser). Six 6-inch secondary battery. Coal-fired horizontal compound engines (reciprocating). 18 knots (adequate for 1880s). Fought Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) - Japan's emergence as naval power. Fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) - victory over European power. Both scrapped 1912 (obsolete but honorable service). Founded Japanese cruiser tradition.

**Design:** Medium protected cruiser hull (300 ft, 3,650 tons). Two single 10.2-inch guns (heavy armament for cruiser - fore and aft). Six single 6-inch guns (broadside). Two 47mm guns. Four 14-inch torpedo tubes. Protected cruiser armor: 3-inch deck over vitals, no belt. Coal-fired horizontal compound reciprocating engines. Two shafts. 18 knots. Long range (9,000 nm at 10 knots - good for Pacific). Crew 357. British construction standards (high quality). Victorian-era warship design.

**Ships (2 built - both scrapped):**

**Both British-built, both scrapped 1912:**
1. **Naniwa** (Fast Wave) - Built Armstrong Newcastle UK, commissioned 1886, scrapped 1912
2. **Takachiho** (High Tide) - Built Armstrong Newcastle UK, commissioned 1887, scrapped 1912

**Construction:**

**Both ships:**
- **Builder:** Armstrong Whitworth, Elswick, Newcastle, UK
- **Laid down:** 1884-1885
- **Launched:** 1885-1886
- **Commissioned:** 1886-1887
- **Delivered:** Sailed from UK to Japan

**Service History:**

**Early Service (1886-1894):**
- Training Japanese crews
- Showing the flag (Meiji Japan's emergence)
- Fleet exercises
- China station patrols
- Demonstrating modern naval power

**Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895):**
*Japan's First Modern War*

**Background:**
- War over Korea
- China (traditional power) vs Japan (rising power)
- Naval superiority crucial

**Battle of the Yalu River (September 17, 1894):**
- **Major naval battle** (first modern fleet action for Japan)
- Japanese Combined Fleet vs Chinese Beiyang Fleet
- **Naniwa and Takachiho participated**
- Japanese victory (superior gunnery, tactics)
- Sank/damaged several Chinese ships
- **Established Japanese naval dominance**

**Naniwa's Notable Action:**
- Sank Chinese transport *Kowshing* (carrying Chinese troops)
- Controversial (British-flagged ship)
- International incident but legal under prize law
- Demonstrated Japanese resolve

**War Result:**
- Japanese naval victory
- China defeated
- Japan gained Taiwan, influence over Korea
- **Naniwa and Takachiho: Veterans of Japan's first modern naval victory**

**Post-Sino War (1895-1904):**
- Training ships
- Fleet exercises
- Already aging by 1900
- But: Kept in service (Japan needed every ship)

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
*Against European Power*

**Background:**
- War with Russia (European great power)
- Naval conflict critical
- **Naniwa and Takachiho:** 18 years old by war start (ancient)

**Service:**
- **Both participated** in various operations
- Convoy escort
- Coastal bombardment
- Fleet screening
- **Too old for battleline** (too slow, lightly armed)
- But: Useful for secondary duties

**Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905):**
- Decisive Japanese naval victory
- Destroyed Russian Baltic Fleet
- **Naniwa and Takachiho present** but secondary roles
- Japanese victory complete
- **Japan first Asian power to defeat European power at sea**

**Post-War (1905-1912):**
- Reserve fleet
- Training ships
- Completely obsolete (20+ years old)
- **Both scrapped 1912** (26 years service - excellent for era)

**Why British-Built:**

**Japan's Situation (1880s):**
1. **Meiji Restoration:** Modernizing after centuries of isolation
2. **No shipyards:** Japanese yards couldn't build modern warships
3. **Need urgent:** Threats from China, Russia, Western powers
4. **British expertise:** Britain world's leading naval power
5. **Money available:** Meiji government investing in military

**Solution:**
- Order modern warships from British yards
- Armstrong Whitworth (premier builder)
- Technology transfer
- Train Japanese crews on modern ships
- Learn to eventually build domestically

**Armstrong Whitworth:**

**Famous British Builder:**
- Built warships for many nations
- High quality, advanced designs
- Elswick Works (Newcastle) - major shipyard
- **Japanese orders (1880s-1900s):**
  - Naniwa-class (2 protected cruisers, 1886)
  - Multiple battleships
  - Technology transferred to Japan
  - Helped Japan develop domestic industry

**Protected Cruiser Design:**

**Concept (1880s-1890s):**
- Armored deck over machinery/magazines (2-3 inches)
- No belt armor on sides
- Protection from plunging fire (shells hitting deck)
- Lighter than armored cruisers
- Faster, longer range

**Naniwa-Class:**
- 3-inch armored deck
- Slopes on deck edges
- Magazines/engines protected
- Sides unarmored (vulnerable to broadside)
- Adequate for 1886, obsolete by 1900s

**10.2-inch Guns:**

**Heavy for Cruiser:**
- Battleships: 12-14-inch
- **Naniwa: 10.2-inch** (almost battleship caliber)
- Cruisers normally: 6-8-inch

**Why So Heavy:**
- 1880s thinking: Cruisers might fight battleships
- Heavy guns for penetration
- But: Only two guns (limited firepower)
- Later abandoned (too slow firing, too few guns)

**Comparison - Early Cruisers:**
| Class | Ships | Built | Tons | Guns | Wars | Fate |
|-------|-------|-------|------|------|------|------|
| **Naniwa** | **2** | **UK 1886** | **3,650** | **2× 10.2\" + 6× 6\"** | **Sino, Russo** | **Scrapped 1912** |
| Chikuma | 3 | Japan 1912 | 4,950 | 8× 6" | WWI | Scrapped 1930s |
| Tenryu | 2 | Japan 1919 | 3,948 | 4× 5.5" | WWII | Lost WWII |

**Naniwa: Earliest, British-built, two-war veterans**

**26-Year Service Life:**

**Excellent for Era:**
- 1880s ships: 20-25 years typical
- **Naniwa: 1886-1912 = 26 years**
- Fought two wars (1894, 1904)
- Honorable retirement
- Technology evolved beyond them (dreadnoughts, turbines, oil)

**Why Scrapped 1912:**
1. **Age:** 26 years old
2. **Technology:** Coal compound engines (obsolete)
3. **Speed:** 18 knots (modern cruisers 25+ knots)
4. **Armament:** 10.2-inch guns interesting but ship too old
5. **Dreadnought era:** All pre-dreadnought ships obsolete
6. **No value:** Even for training (too primitive)

**Legacy:** Naniwa-class represented Meiji Japan's naval modernization. Two British-built protected cruisers (1886-1887) - first modern Japanese cruisers. Fought Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) - Japan's emergence as naval power. Fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) - first Asian defeat of European power at sea. 26 years service (1886-1912). Both scrapped when obsolete. Founded Japanese cruiser tradition. British-built but Japanese-manned - learned modern naval warfare. Technology transfer enabled later domestic construction. By 1920s Japan building world-class cruisers (Furutaka onwards) - journey started with Naniwa. Names: Naniwa (Fast Wave), Takachiho (High Tide - later name reused for seaplane tender lost WWII).

**Historical Significance:** Naniwa-class marked Japan's transformation from feudal to modern naval power. Commissioned 1886-1887 when Japan emerging from isolation (Meiji Restoration 1868). British-built because Japan couldn't yet build modern warships. Fought Sino-Japanese War (1894) - proved Japan could defeat Asian rival. Fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) - proved Japan could defeat European great power. Battle of Tsushima (1905) - Naniwa present when Japan destroyed Russian fleet. Evolution: Naniwa (1886, British-built, 3,650 tons) → 60 years later → Mogami (WWII, Japanese-built, 13,000 tons, world-class). Naniwa: Humble beginning. Scrapped 1912 (26 years old) when dreadnought revolution made all pre-1906 ships obsolete. But honor: Founded tradition, taught Japanese Navy modern warfare, veterans of two victorious wars. Remembered as pioneers.
