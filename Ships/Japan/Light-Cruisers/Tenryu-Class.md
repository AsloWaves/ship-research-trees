**Smallest Cruisers** - Tenryu-class were Japan's first modern light cruisers. 2 ships built 1919. Smallest cruisers in IJN (3,230 tons). Four 5.5-inch guns + six 21-inch torpedoes. Oldest cruisers in WWII combat (built 1919, fought 1941-1944). Both sunk by submarines - Tenryu December 1942, Tatsuta March 1944.

**Key Specs:** 3,230/4,350 tons | 463ft | 33 kn | 4× 140mm + 6× 533mm torpedoes | 63mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First modern Japanese light cruisers (post-WWI design). Smallest cruiser-classified ships in IJN. Destroyer leader concept - command destroyer flotillas. High speed (33 knots) for 1919. Four 5.5-inch guns (minimal for cruiser). Six 21-inch torpedoes. Mixed coal/oil firing. Both served entire war despite age (24-25 years old in combat). Oldest cruisers in combat service WWII by any navy.

**Design:** Four single 5.5-inch guns (two forward, two aft). Two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes. Small displacement (3,230 tons - destroyer size). High speed (33 knots). Light armor (2.5-inch belt). Mixed coal/oil boilers (obsolete by WWII). Mine-laying capability. Three shafts. Essentially large destroyer leaders. Cramped for cruiser standards.

**Ships:**
- **Tenryu** - Sunk December 18, 1942 (submarine USS Albacore), 285 killed
- **Tatsuta** - Sunk March 13, 1944 (submarine USS Sandlance), 194 killed

**Construction:**
- **Tenryu:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, laid down May 17, 1917, launched March 11, 1918, commissioned November 20, 1919
- **Tatsuta:** Sasebo Naval Arsenal, laid down July 24, 1917, launched May 29, 1918, commissioned March 31, 1919

**Service:**
- **Tenryu (1919-1942):**
  - 1919-1941: Training, China operations, fleet exercises
  - 1941: Philippines invasion support
  - 1942: Dutch East Indies, Solomon Islands operations
  - **December 18, 1942:** Torpedoed by USS Albacore off New Britain

- **Tatsuta (1919-1944):**
  - 1919-1941: Training, China operations
  - 1941-1942: Wake Island, Philippines, Dutch East Indies
  - 1942-1943: Solomons, Rabaul operations
  - 1944: Transport/convoy escort duties
  - **March 13, 1944:** Torpedoed by USS Sandlance off Yokosuka

**Sinking of Tenryu (December 18, 1942):**
**Background:**
- Escorting convoy near Madang, New Guinea
- USS Albacore (SS-218) on patrol

**December 18, 1942 (3:09 AM):**
- USS Albacore fired 4 torpedoes
- Two torpedoes hit Tenryu
- Hits amidships and forward
- Severe flooding, fires
- **3:28 AM:** Capsized and sank
- **285 killed, 47 survivors**
- Quick sinking (19 minutes) due to small size

**Sinking of Tatsuta (March 13, 1944):**
**Background:**
- Returning to Yokosuka from Iwo Jima
- Transporting passengers and cargo
- USS Sandlance (SS-381) on patrol near Yokosuka

**March 13, 1944:**
- USS Sandlance fired 3 torpedoes
- At least two hits on Tatsuta
- Massive explosions (magazine hit)
- **Sank in minutes**
- **194 killed, 138 survivors**
- Sunk close to home port (near Yokosuka entrance)

**Why Both Lost to Submarines:**
1. **Small size:** Easy targets, less survivability
2. **Light armor:** 2.5-inch belt insufficient against torpedoes
3. **Old design:** 1919 - no modern ASW equipment
4. **Slow ASW:** Limited depth charges, old tactics
5. **US submarine superiority:** By 1942-1944, US subs dominated

**Age in WWII:**
- **Built:** 1919
- **WWII service:** 1941-1944
- **Age when sunk:** 23-25 years old
- **Oldest cruisers in WWII combat** by any navy
- Designed for WWI-era warfare, fought in WWII

**140mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as later cruisers (Kuma, Nagara, Sendai)
- **Caliber:** 140mm (5.5 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 19,750 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 5-7 rounds per minute
- Only 4 guns (vs 7 on later cruisers)

**Comparison - Small Cruisers:**
| Ship | Nation | Displacement | Guns | Year | Fate |
|------|--------|--------------|------|------|------|
| **Tenryu** | **Japan** | **3,230** | **4× 5.5"** | **1919** | **Submarine** |
| **Tatsuta** | **Japan** | **3,230** | **4× 5.5"** | **1919** | **Submarine** |
| Emden | Germany | 5,600 | 8× 5.9" | 1925 | Survived |
| Duguay-Trouin | France | 7,249 | 8× 6.1" | 1926 | Survived |

**Why So Small:**
- **WWI design:** Built during transition period
- **Experimental:** First modern light cruisers
- **Destroyer leader:** Designed to lead flotillas, not fleet actions
- **Budget:** Smaller = cheaper
- **Speed priority:** Light displacement for high speed

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Destroyer flotilla leader:** Command destroyer squadrons
- **Fast scouting:** Reconnaissance for main fleet
- **Convoy escort:** Protecting transports
- **Transport duties:** Carrying troops/supplies (late war)
- **Secondary operations:** Not frontline combatants by WWII

**Modernization (1930s-1940s):**
- AA armament increased: 1× 76mm and 12× 25mm added
- Torpedoes upgraded to Type 8
- Depth charges added
- Fire control improved
- But fundamentally limited by size and age
- Could not be significantly upgraded

**Why Used in WWII:**
- **All hulls needed:** Every warship valuable
- **Still functional:** Despite age, mechanically sound
- **Fast enough:** 33 knots adequate for escorts
- **Familiar:** Crews trained on these ships
- **Secondary duties:** Suitable for convoy escort, transport

**Loss Statistics:**
- **2 built, 2 sunk (100% loss rate)**
- **Both by submarines**
- **Loss period:** December 1942 - March 1944 (15 months)

**Notable Achievements:**
- **Longevity:** 23-25 years service (1919-1942/1944)
- **Continuous service:** Fought in China operations (1930s) and WWII
- **Durability:** Despite age and small size, served throughout war
- **First modern cruisers:** Pioneered post-WWI Japanese cruiser design

**Design Limitations:**
- **Too small:** 3,230 tons inadequate for cruiser role by WWII
- **Weak armament:** Only 4× 5.5-inch guns (vs 7-10 on other cruisers)
- **Old machinery:** Mixed coal/oil firing obsolete
- **Light protection:** 2.5-inch belt insufficient
- **Limited upgrade potential:** Size prevented major improvements

**Legacy:** Tenryu-class pioneered modern Japanese light cruiser design. Smallest cruisers in IJN (3,230 tons). Both served 23-25 years - remarkable longevity. Oldest cruisers in WWII combat by any navy. Both sunk by submarines (100% submarine loss rate). Tenryu sunk escorting convoy New Guinea. Tatsuta sunk near home port (Yokosuka). Small size and age made them vulnerable but both served courageously. Design influenced subsequent larger cruisers (Kuma, Nagara, Sendai). Showed even small, old ships had value in desperate war. Names: Rivers in Japan - Tenryu, Tatsuta.

**Historical Significance:** Tenryu-class represented Japan's first modern light cruisers. Built 1919, fought 1941-1944 - impressive 23-25 year service life. Oldest cruisers in WWII combat showed Japan's shortage - even obsolete ships pressed into service. Small size (3,230 tons) made them vulnerable - both sunk by submarines within 15 months. Despite limitations, both served throughout war in various roles. Design pioneered destroyer-leader concept that influenced later classes. Showed that age and size didn't prevent service but increased vulnerability. Both died to submarines - epitomized US submarine campaign's effectiveness against all IJN ship types regardless of size.
