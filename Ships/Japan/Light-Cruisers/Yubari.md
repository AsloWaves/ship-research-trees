**The Experiment** - Yubari was an experimental light cruiser testing compact design concepts. 1 ship built 1923. Smallest "true" cruiser (2,890 tons) with six 5.5-inch guns + torpedoes. Revolutionary weight-saving techniques by designer Yuzuru Hiraga. Influenced all subsequent IJN cruiser designs. High speed (35.5 knots) on small hull. Sunk April 1944 by submarine USS Bluegill.

**Key Specs:** 2,890/4,443 tons | 463ft | 35.5 kn | 6× 140mm + 4× 610mm torpedoes | 38mm belt | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Revolutionary experimental design by Yuzuru Hiraga. Maximized armament on minimal displacement. Six 5.5-inch guns (two twin turrets + two singles) on 2,890-ton hull - same guns as 5,500-ton Kuma-class. Compact machinery layout. Light armor. High speed (35.5 knots). Weight-saving techniques throughout. Proof-of-concept for "maximum armament, minimum tonnage" philosophy. **Every subsequent IJN cruiser (1920s-1940s) incorporated Yubari's design principles.** Most influential Japanese warship never mass-produced.

**Design:** Experimental compact layout. Two twin 5.5-inch turrets (one forward, one aft) + two single 5.5-inch mounts (amidships). Four single 24-inch torpedo tubes. Three-shaft propulsion (unusual). Light armor (1.5-inch belt). Small displacement (2,890 tons - destroyer-size). High speed (35.5 knots). Cramped interior. Innovative machinery arrangement. Mine-laying capability. Hiraga's masterpiece - fit cruiser armament on destroyer tonnage.

**Ship:**
- **Yubari** - Sunk April 27, 1944 (submarine USS Bluegill, off Sonsorol Island), 200+ killed

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Sasebo Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** June 5, 1922
- **Launched:** March 5, 1923
- **Commissioned:** July 31, 1923

**Service History:**

**Interwar Period (1923-1941):**
- **1923-1930:** Training, fleet exercises, experimental ship
- Tested new weapons, tactics, equipment
- Design evaluated extensively
- Influenced Kuma, Nagara, Sendai classes
- **1930s:** China operations (Second Sino-Japanese War)
- Modernized with improved AA armament

**WWII Service (1941-1944):**

**December 1941 - Wake Island:**
- Part of invasion force
- Supported landings
- Escaped major damage

**1942 - Aleutian Campaign:**
- Invasion of Attu and Kiska
- Screening and support duties
- Operated in harsh North Pacific conditions

**1942-1943 - Solomons:**
- Multiple Tokyo Express runs
- Guadalcanal operations
- Convoy escort duties
- Several close calls with US forces

**1943-1944 - Central Pacific:**
- Convoy escort (primary role)
- ASW patrols
- Transport duties
- By 1944, obsolete but still needed

**Sinking (April 27, 1944):**

**Background:**
- Escorting convoy from Palau to Sonsorol Island
- Age showing (21 years old in 1944)
- **USS Bluegill (SS-242)** on patrol

**April 27, 1944 (Evening):**
- **USS Bluegill detected convoy**
- Fired spread of 4 torpedoes at Yubari
- **Two torpedoes hit Yubari amidships**
- Severe flooding, fires
- Engine rooms flooded
- **Dead in water**

**Sinking:**
- Damage control efforts failed
- Small size meant limited survivability
- Flooding spread rapidly
- **Capsized and sank within 2 hours**
- **200+ killed, 120+ survivors**
- Escort destroyers rescued survivors
- USS Bluegill escaped undamaged

**Why Sank So Quickly:**
1. **Small size:** 2,890 tons - limited reserve buoyancy
2. **Light armor:** 1.5-inch belt insufficient against torpedoes
3. **Compact layout:** Flooding spread easily
4. **Age:** 21 years old - structural fatigue
5. **Torpedo hits amidships:** Flooded vital machinery spaces
6. **No damage control modernization:** Old equipment

**Yuzuru Hiraga - Designer:**
*Legendary naval architect*

**Background:**
- Chief Designer, Imperial Japanese Navy
- Designed Yubari as experimental ship
- Goal: Maximum armament, minimum displacement

**Innovations Tested on Yubari:**
1. **Compact machinery:** Reduced space and weight
2. **Welding techniques:** Lighter than riveting
3. **Optimized armor layout:** Protection only where needed
4. **Twin turrets:** Space-efficient armament
5. **High-strength steel:** Lighter structure, same strength

**Influence on Later Designs:**
Every IJN cruiser 1920s-1940s used Yubari principles:
- **Kuma-class (1920s):** Compact design, twin turrets
- **Nagara-class (1920s):** Refined Yubari layout
- **Sendai-class (1920s):** Further refinement
- **Agano-class (1940s):** Modern application of principles
- **Even heavy cruisers:** Mogami, Takao classes used concepts

**Design Philosophy:**
- "Maximum fighting power, minimum tonnage"
- Influenced Washington/London Naval Treaty designs
- Made treaty cruisers more effective
- But: Small size = limited survivability

**140mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Tenryu, Kuma, Nagara, Sendai classes
- **Caliber:** 140mm (5.5 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 19,750 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 5-7 rounds per minute
- **Shell weight:** 38 kg (84 lbs)

**Comparison - Compact Cruisers:**
| Ship | Nation | Displacement | Main Guns | Speed | Design Philosophy |
|------|--------|--------------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Yubari** | **Japan** | **2,890** | **6× 5.5"** | **35.5 kn** | **Experimental compact** |
| Tenryu | Japan | 3,230 | 4× 5.5" | 33 kn | Destroyer leader |
| Emden | Germany | 5,600 | 8× 5.9" | 29 kn | Treaty cruiser |
| Omaha | USA | 7,050 | 12× 6" | 35 kn | Scout cruiser |

**Why Only One Built:**
**Advantages shown:**
- Design principles worked
- Armament effective
- Speed good
- Economical construction

**Problems shown:**
- **Too cramped:** Crew comfort poor
- **Limited survivability:** Small size, light armor
- **Marginal seaworthiness:** Light in heavy seas
- **Limited upgrade potential:** No space for improvements

**Decision:** Apply principles to larger ships (Kuma-class), not build more Yubaris

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Destroyer flotilla leader:** Command squadrons
- **Fast scouting:** Reconnaissance
- **Convoy escort:** Protecting transports
- **Tokyo Express:** Fast supply runs
- **Experimental platform:** Testing weapons/equipment

**Modernization (1930s-1940s):**
- AA armament increased: 0 to 12× 25mm
- Fire control improved
- Depth charges added
- Torpedoes upgraded
- But limited by small size
- Could not be significantly upgraded

**Legacy:** Yubari was most influential Japanese warship never mass-produced. Experimental design (1923) tested revolutionary compact layout principles. Designer Yuzuru Hiraga's masterpiece - six 5.5-inch guns on 2,890-ton hull (destroyer displacement). Weight-saving techniques, compact machinery, twin turrets. **Every subsequent IJN cruiser incorporated Yubari's design lessons.** Made treaty cruisers more effective by maximizing armament within tonnage limits. Served 21 years (1923-1944) before submarine torpedoes sank her. Small size meant limited survivability. Proved concepts but showed need for larger hulls. Name: Yubari River, Hokkaido.

**Historical Significance:** Yubari represented Japanese design philosophy - maximum capability, minimum size. Revolutionary 1923 design influenced decades of cruiser construction. Hiraga's compact layout, weight-saving techniques became standard on all IJN cruisers through WWII. Proved "small but deadly" concept worked but at cost of survivability. Only one built because cramped, limited upgrade potential. But design principles lived on in Kuma, Nagara, Sendai, Agano classes. Sunk 1944 by submarine - small size, light armor, age made her vulnerable. Most important lesson: Good ideas can be incorporated into better designs. Yubari tested concepts, larger cruisers perfected them. Experimental ship's influence far exceeded single hull.
