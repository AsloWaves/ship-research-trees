**Last Protected Cruiser** - Tone (1910) was Japan's last protected cruiser design. 1 ship commissioned 1910. Single ship class (unique). Medium-sized (4,100 tons), coal-fired, 23 knots. Two 8-inch guns + ten 4.7-inch. WWI Pacific service. Scrapped 1931 after 21 years service. Represented end of protected cruiser era - Japan transitioning to modern light cruisers (Tenryu onwards, 1919). Name later reused for famous WWII Tone-class heavy cruiser (1938). Note: Not same as WWII Tone.

**Key Specs:** 4,100/4,590 tons | 399ft | 23 kn | 2× 203mm + 10× 120mm | 51mm deck/slopes | Coal reciprocating | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Last Japanese protected cruiser design. Single ship class (unique - experimental or one-off order). Larger than earlier protected cruisers (4,100 vs 3,650 tons Naniwa). Two 8-inch main guns (heavy cruiser caliber). Ten 4.7-inch secondary battery. Coal-fired reciprocating engines (traditional but obsolete by 1910). 23 knots (good for 1910). Protected cruiser armor scheme (deck armor, minimal belt). WWI Pacific operations. By time commissioned (1910), protected cruiser concept already obsolete (armored cruisers, battlecruisers emerging). Scrapped 1931. Last of breed - all future Japanese cruisers used different concepts (light cruisers, heavy cruisers).

**Design:** Medium cruiser hull (399 ft, 4,100 tons). Two single 8-inch guns (one forward, one aft - heavy for protected cruiser). Ten single 4.7-inch guns (broadside battery). Four 3-inch guns. Three submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Protected cruiser armor: 2-inch deck, 2-inch slopes, minimal belt. Coal-fired vertical triple expansion reciprocating engines. Two shafts. 23 knots. Crew 430. Pre-WWI construction - traditional technology, riveted hull. Last protected cruiser before Japan shifted to modern all-big-gun light cruisers (Tenryu, 1919).

**Ship (1 built):**

**Scrapped:**
1. **Tone** - Commissioned May 15, 1910, scrapped 1931 (note: not same as WWII heavy cruiser Tone, 1938)

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki
- **Laid down:** 1907
- **Launched:** April 15, 1907
- **Commissioned:** May 15, 1910

**Service History:**

**Pre-WWI (1910-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training cruiser
- China station patrols
- Already obsolescent when commissioned
- Dreadnought revolution (1906) made protected cruisers obsolete

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Pacific operations
- German colony capture support
- Convoy escort
- Anti-commerce raider patrols
- Limited combat (Pacific quiet after 1914)

**Post-WWI (1919-1931):**
- Training cruiser
- Reserve fleet
- By 1920 completely obsolete
- Modern light cruisers entering service (Tenryu 1919, Kuma 1920)
- **Scrapped 1931** (21 years service)

**Why Single Ship Class:**

**Unusual:**
- Most classes: 2-10+ ships
- **Tone: Only 1 ship**

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **Experimental:** Testing design concepts
2. **Budget:** Funds for one ship only
3. **Transition:** Between old (protected cruiser) and new (light cruiser) concepts
4. **Obsolescence:** Recognized protected cruiser obsolete, built one anyway (contract committed)
5. **Named ship:** Built for specific purpose/honor

**Result:**
- Unique class
- Last of type
- Not repeated

**Why Scrapped 1931:**

**Obsolescence:**
1. **Age:** 21 years old
2. **Concept:** Protected cruiser obsolete by 1910
3. **Technology:** Coal reciprocating (all modern cruisers oil turbines)
4. **Speed:** 23 knots (modern 33+ knots)
5. **Armament:** Two 8-inch + ten 4.7-inch (modern cruisers better armed)

**Treaty Era:**
- London Naval Treaty (1930): Cruiser limits
- Japan needed tonnage for modern cruisers
- Scrapping Tone freed ~4,000 tons
- Better modern cruisers than old protected cruiser

**Protected Cruiser Concept - End:**

**Why Abandoned:**
1. **Dreadnought revolution:** All-big-gun ships rendered mixed armament obsolete
2. **Armored cruisers:** Heavy armor better than deck armor
3. **Light cruisers:** All medium-caliber guns (6-inch) more effective than mixed (8-inch + 4.7-inch)
4. **Speed:** New turbine cruisers faster (30+ knots vs 20-23 knots)
5. **Oil:** Oil-fired more efficient than coal

**Tone (1910):**
- Last Japanese protected cruiser
- Obsolete when commissioned
- Concept never repeated

**8-inch Guns on Protected Cruiser:**

**Heavy Armament:**
- Protected cruisers normally: 6-inch guns
- **Tone: 8-inch guns** (heavy cruiser caliber)
- Only two guns (limited firepower)

**Shows Transition:**
- Moving toward heavy armament
- But: Still protected cruiser hull (weak protection)
- Awkward hybrid
- Better solutions: Heavy cruiser (armor + 8-inch guns) or light cruiser (speed + 6-inch guns)

**Name Reuse:**

**Tone:**
- **Original:** Protected cruiser (1910-1931)
- **Later:** Tone-class heavy cruiser (1938-1945)
- WWII Tone much more famous:
  - Pearl Harbor attack
  - Midway scouted US carriers
  - Sunk July 24, 1945 (Kure air raid)

**Original Tone forgotten, later Tone remembered**

**Comparison - Last Protected Cruisers:**
| Ship | Nation | Year | Tons | Main Guns | Fate |
|------|--------|------|------|-----------|------|
| **Tone (Japan)** | **Japan** | **1910** | **4,100** | **2× 8"** | **Scrapped 1931** |
| Chikuma | Japan | 1912 | 4,950 | 8× 6" | Scrapped 1930s |
| Hirado | Japan | 1912 | 5,050 | 6× 6" | Scrapped 1940 |

**Tone: Last pure protected cruiser design (others transitional)**

**Legacy:** Tone (1910) represented last Japanese protected cruiser. Single ship commissioned 1910. Two 8-inch guns, ten 4.7-inch, 23 knots, 4,100 tons. Protected cruiser concept (deck armor only). WWI Pacific service. Scrapped 1931 after 21 years. Last of breed - all future Japanese cruisers followed different concepts (Tenryu light cruisers 1919, Furutaka heavy cruisers 1926). Obsolete when commissioned (Dreadnought revolution 1906). Name later reused for famous WWII Tone-class heavy cruiser (1938). Original Tone forgotten but name honored.

**Historical Significance:** Tone (1910) marked end of protected cruiser era for Japan. Last ship using deck-armor-only concept. Commissioned 1910 when concept already obsolete - Dreadnought (1906) revolutionized naval warfare, protected cruisers instantly outdated. Single ship class (unique) suggests Japan recognized futility - built one because designed, never repeated. By 1919 Japan building modern Tenryu-class light cruisers (oil-fired, turbines, 33 knots, all 5.5-inch guns). Evolution visible: Tone (1910, coal, 23 knots, protected cruiser) → Tenryu (1919, oil, 33 knots, modern light cruiser) = generational leap in 9 years. Tone: Dinosaur at birth. Tenryu: Modern warship. Name later given to WWII Tone-class heavy cruiser (much more successful). Original Tone: Forgotten footnote. Later Tone: Pearl Harbor veteran. Shows importance of technology vs name.
