**Scout Cruisers** - Tone-class were unique heavy cruisers with all eight 8-inch guns forward, large aviation facilities aft. 2 ships. Scout cruiser concept - support carrier operations with reconnaissance aircraft (5-7 floatplanes). Both participated in all six major carrier battles 1941-1942. Tone sunk October 1944 (Kure air raid). Chikuma sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle off Samar).

**Key Specs:** 13,360/15,443 tons | 662ft | 35 kn | 8× 203mm (all forward) + 8× 127mm DP + 12× 610mm torpedoes + 5-7 floatplanes | 102mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Unique all-guns-forward layout - four twin 8-inch turrets superfiring forward. Entire stern area dedicated to aviation facilities - large catapults, hangars, cranes for 5-7 floatplanes. Scout cruiser concept - designed to provide reconnaissance for carrier task forces. Both ships participated in all six major carrier battles 1941-1942 (Pearl Harbor, Wake, Rabaul, Darwin, Ceylon, Midway). Last heavy cruisers completed by IJN. Design influenced by Mogami conversion experience.

**Design:** Four twin 8-inch turrets all forward (superfiring). No aft main turrets - entire stern for aviation. Two large catapults aft. Hangars for 5-7 floatplanes (mostly scouts). High speed (35 knots). Good range (8,000 nm). Twelve 24-inch torpedo tubes. Eight 5-inch DP guns amidships. Light armor (4-inch belt). Designed for carrier escort and scouting missions. Excellent seakeeping for aircraft operations.

**Ships:**
- **Tone** - Sunk July 24, 1945 (Kure, air raid while in shallow water), salvaged and scrapped 1947-1948
- **Chikuma** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle off Samar), 891 killed

**Construction:**
- **Tone:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down December 1, 1934, launched November 21, 1937, commissioned November 20, 1938
- **Chikuma:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down October 1, 1935, launched March 19, 1938, commissioned May 20, 1939

**Service:**
- **Tone (1938-1945):**
  - 1939-1941: Training, China operations
  - **December 7, 1941:** Pearl Harbor attack (scout cruiser for Kido Butai)
  - 1942: Wake, Rabaul, Darwin, Ceylon raids
  - **June 4, 1942:** Battle of Midway (launched reconnaissance aircraft)
  - 1943-1944: Guadalcanal, Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf
  - **July 24, 1945:** Sunk at Kure in shallow water by carrier aircraft
  - **July 28, 1945:** Capsized after additional attacks
  - Salvaged 1947-1948, scrapped

- **Chikuma (1939-1944):**
  - 1939-1941: Training, China operations
  - **December 7, 1941:** Pearl Harbor attack (scout cruiser)
  - 1942: Wake, Rabaul, Darwin, Ceylon, Midway
  - 1943-1944: Guadalcanal, Philippine Sea
  - **October 25, 1944:** Battle off Samar - sunk

**Pearl Harbor Attack (December 7, 1941):**
- Both Tone and Chikuma accompanied Kido Butai
- Scout cruiser role: launch reconnaissance aircraft
- Provided early warning and scouting for carrier force
- **Tone's scout aircraft:**
  - Spotted US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor
  - Confirmed fleet location and composition
  - Critical intelligence for strike waves
- Both ships provided AA defense and plane guard duties

**Battle of Midway (June 4, 1942):**
*Tone's Scout Delayed - Historical Consequence*

- Both Tone and Chikuma launched reconnaissance aircraft dawn June 4
- **Tone's Seaplane No. 4:**
  - Scheduled launch 4:30 AM
  - **Delayed 30 minutes** due to catapult malfunction
  - Assigned search pattern toward US carrier position
  - **7:28 AM:** Spotted US task force
  - Report vague: "Ten ships, apparently enemy"
  - **8:20 AM:** Confirmed "carriers" present
- **Historical impact:** 30-minute delay meant US carriers discovered AFTER Japanese strike launched against Midway Island
- Japanese aircraft armed with land-attack bombs, not anti-ship torpedoes
- Rearming aircraft when US dive bombers arrived
- Tone's delay contributed to Midway disaster

**Other Major Battles:**
- **Wake Island (December 23, 1941):** Supported capture
- **Darwin Raid (February 19, 1942):** Escorted carriers
- **Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942):** Scouted for carrier strikes on Ceylon
- **Battle of Santa Cruz (October 26, 1942):** Tone damaged by dive bomber
- **Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19-20, 1944):** Both survived
- **Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 23-25, 1944):** Both participated, Chikuma sunk

**Battle off Samar - Chikuma (October 25, 1944):**
*Last action of Chikuma*

**Background:**
- Part of Admiral Kurita's Center Force
- Engaged US escort carriers and destroyers (Taffy 3)

**The Battle:**
- **7:00 AM:** Commenced attack on escort carriers
- Chikuma engaged destroyers and destroyer escorts
- **Hit by multiple shell hits** from destroyers USS Johnston and Heermann
- **9:07 AM:** Torpedoed by TBM Avenger from escort carrier
- Torpedo hit amidships, severe flooding
- Dead in water, listing
- Continued to fire guns at aircraft
- **9:30 AM:** Ordered scuttled
- Destroyers rescued survivors, then torpedoed Chikuma
- **11:00 AM:** Sank
- **891 killed**

**Kure Air Raid - Tone (July 24-28, 1945):**
- Tone moored at Kure Naval Base
- Immobilized due to fuel shortage
- Used as floating AA battery
- **July 24, 1945:** Attacked by 400+ carrier aircraft from US Task Force 38
- Multiple bomb and rocket hits
- Settled in shallow water (10 meters depth)
- **July 28, 1945:** Additional attacks, capsized
- Remained partially above water
- Salvaged 1947-1948, scrapped

**Aviation Facilities:**
- **Catapults:** Two large catapults aft
- **Hangars:** Two hangars below deck level
- **Aircraft capacity:** 5-7 floatplanes (typically 5)
- **Types operated:**
  - Nakajima E8N "Dave" (reconnaissance)
  - Mitsubishi F1M "Pete" (observation)
  - Aichi E13A "Jake" (long-range reconnaissance) - primary type
  - Kawanishi E7K "Alf" (older type)
- **Cranes:** Large crane for recovering aircraft
- **Facilities:** Maintenance shops, fuel storage, ordnance
- **Operational advantage:** Could launch/recover aircraft in higher seas than carriers

**Scout Cruiser Concept:**
- Provide long-range reconnaissance for carrier task forces
- Launch aircraft beyond carrier detection range
- Scout ahead of fleet to locate enemy
- Provide additional air search capacity
- Guard carriers from surprise
- Recover damaged carrier aircraft if needed
- AA defense for carriers

**All-Guns-Forward Layout:**
**Advantages:**
- Maximum forward firepower
- Protected approach (bow-on)
- Aviation facilities unobstructed aft
- Efficient use of weight/space

**Disadvantages:**
- Zero aft firepower (stern chase vulnerability)
- All turrets vulnerable to single magazine explosion
- Unbalanced weight distribution
- Unique layout complicated construction

**Comparison - Tone vs Standard Heavy Cruiser:**
| Feature | Tone-class | Takao-class |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Main guns | 8× forward | 5× turrets (3 fwd, 2 aft) |
| Aircraft | 5-7 floatplanes | 3 floatplanes |
| Stern area | Aviation facilities | Turrets 4 & 5 |
| Role | Scout cruiser | General purpose |

**Legacy:** Tone-class unique design demonstrated IJN innovation and carrier-centric doctrine. All-guns-forward layout never repeated by any navy - interesting experiment but impractical. Scout cruiser concept validated - aviation facilities supported carrier operations effectively. Both ships participated in all six major carrier battles 1941-1942 - remarkable combat record. Tone's delayed seaplane at Midway had historical consequences. Chikuma fought to end at Samar. Tone survived to war's end, sunk in port. Design influenced no successors - last IJN heavy cruisers. Names: Rivers in Japan - Tone (Chiba), Chikuma (Nagano).

**Historical Significance:** Tone-class embodied carrier-centric doctrine - designed specifically to support carrier operations. Participated in more carrier battles than any other cruiser class (6 battles). Tone's Midway reconnaissance delay contributed to Japanese defeat - 30 minutes changed history. All-guns-forward layout demonstrated Japanese willingness to experiment. Scout cruiser concept showed importance of reconnaissance in carrier warfare. Chikuma's loss at Samar showed courage against overwhelming odds. Tone's survival to July 1945 meant witnessing IJN's complete defeat. Last heavy cruisers completed by any nation before Washington Treaty expiration - end of treaty era.
