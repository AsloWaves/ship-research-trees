**Treaty Cruisers** - Nachi-class (Myoko subclass) were Japan's first 10,000-ton treaty heavy cruisers. 4 ships commissioned 1928-1929. Ten 8-inch guns + 16 Long Lance torpedoes. High speed (35.5 knots). All 4 saw extensive combat. All 4 lost 1944-1945 (100% loss rate). Myoko sunk by submarine, Nachi at Manila Bay, Ashigara by submarine, Haguro surface action (last heavy cruiser lost, May 1945).

**Key Specs:** 10,000/13,380 tons | 668ft | 35.5 kn | 10× 203mm + 8× 127mm DP + 16× 610mm torpedoes | 100mm belt | 4 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese treaty heavy cruisers (Washington Treaty 10,000-ton limit). Maximum armament within treaty limits: Ten 8-inch guns (five twin turrets), 16 torpedoes (four quad launchers with Long Lance). High speed (35.5 knots). Good range (8,000 nm). Light armor to stay within tonnage. All four extensively modernized 1930s-1940s. Formed backbone of Japanese cruiser force. All four lost in combat - epitomized IJN heavy cruiser losses. Haguro last IJN heavy cruiser sunk (May 16, 1945).

**Design:** Five twin 8-inch turrets (three forward, two aft). Eight 5-inch DP guns (four twin mounts). **Sixteen 24-inch torpedoes** in four quad launchers (most on any cruiser). Three floatplanes, two catapults. Four-shaft turbines (35.5 knots). Light armor (4-inch belt) to meet tonnage limits. Tall pagoda-style superstructure (after modernizations). Long, sleek hull. Actually exceeded treaty limits by ~3,000 tons but kept secret. Represented Japanese maximum-armament-within-treaty philosophy (actually cheated).

**Comparison - Treaty Heavy Cruisers:**
| Class | Nation | Ships | Main Guns | Torpedoes | Speed | Lost |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|------|
| **Nachi** | **Japan** | **4** | **10× 8"** | **16** | **35.5 kn** | **4 (100%)** |
| Takao | Japan | 4 | 10× 8" | 16 | 35.5 kn | 3 (75%) |
| Pensacola | USA | 2 | 10× 8" | 0 | 32.5 kn | 0 (0%) |
| Kent | UK | 7 | 8× 8" | 0 | 31.5 kn | 1 (14%) |

**100% loss rate worst among heavy cruiser classes**

**Why 100% Loss Rate:**
1. **Aggressive use:** Frontline combat throughout war
2. **1944-1945:** Allied dominance overwhelming
3. **Submarines:** US/British subs deadly (2 lost)
4. **Air power:** Carrier aircraft unstoppable (1 lost)
5. **Surface action:** Destroyers with torpedoes lethal (1 lost)
6. **Age:** 15-17 years old by 1944-1945, wear showing

**Haguro's Last Stand:**
**Most dramatic loss**

**26th Destroyer Flotilla:**
- 5 British destroyers vs 1 heavy cruiser
- Coordinated torpedo attacks
- Night action (IJN usually advantage)
- But destroyers too fast, too many
- Haguro overwhelmed

**Significance:**
- Last IJN heavy cruiser sunk
- Last major surface action
- Showed destroyer torpedo tactics effective
- Even heavy cruiser vulnerable to coordinated attacks

**Modernizations (1930s-1940s):**

**Major Changes:**
- **Superstructure:** Enlarged to pagoda style
- **AA:** Increased from 4 to 50+ 25mm guns
- **Torpedoes:** Upgraded to Type 93 Long Lance
- **Fire control:** Improved directors and range finders
- **Radar:** Added late war (if time)
- **Armor:** Additional deck armor

**But fundamentally:**
- Still 1928 design
- Light armor vulnerable
- Tall superstructure target for dive bombers

**Legacy:** Nachi-class represented Japan's first treaty heavy cruisers. Maximum armament (ten 8-inch guns, 16 torpedoes) within 10,000-ton limit (actually exceeded). All four saw extensive combat 1941-1945. All four lost (100% loss rate) - worst among heavy cruiser classes. Nachi sunk at Manila Bay (November 1944). Haguro last heavy cruiser lost (May 1945, surface action with British destroyers). Ashigara torpedoed by submarine (June 1945, 853 killed). Myoko damaged, beached, scuttled. Showed aggressive employment led to attrition. Names: Mountains (Nachi, Haguro, Ashigara, Myoko).

**Historical Significance:** Nachi-class epitomized Japanese treaty cruiser philosophy - maximum firepower on minimum tonnage. Actually exceeded 10,000 tons but kept secret. Ten 8-inch guns + 16 Long Lance torpedoes made them most heavily armed cruisers. 100% combat loss rate showed aggressive employment's cost. All four fought Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944) - Myoko torpedoed and forced out, other three survived. Within 7 months, all four gone. Nachi at Manila (air attack). Haguro in last surface action (destroyers). Ashigara to submarine (fastest sinking, 4 minutes). Myoko beached and scuttled. Showed that by 1945, even treaty cruisers obsolete against Allied air/submarine/surface dominance. But fought to end - Haguro and Ashigara lost June 1945, one month before surrender.
