**Night Battle Cruisers** - Sendai-class were 1920s light cruisers designed as destroyer flotilla leaders. 3 ships. Seven 5.5-inch guns + eight 24-inch torpedoes. High speed (35 knots). All three lost in night surface actions 1942-1944 (Guadalcanal and Solomons campaigns). Jintsu's sacrifice at Kolombangara epitomized IJN night-fighting spirit.

**Key Specs:** 5,195/7,100 tons | 535ft | 35.25 kn | 7× 140mm + 8× 610mm Type 93 torpedoes + 20-33× 25mm AA | 63mm belt | 3 ships

**Innovation:** Improved Nagara-class with better seakeeping. Last IJN cruisers with 5.5-inch guns (subsequent classes had 6-inch). Destroyer flotilla leader concept - lead destroyer squadrons. High speed (35 knots) for destroyer operations. Eight Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes. Good night-fighting capability - searchlights, star shells, torpedoes. All three demonstrated IJN night-fighting doctrine in deadly Guadalcanal battles.

**Design:** Seven single 5.5-inch guns (four forward, three aft). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers. High speed for destroyer operations. Light armor (2.5-inch belt). Good maneuverability. Searchlights for night combat. One floatplane for reconnaissance. Mine-laying capability. Designed for night surface actions leading destroyer divisions.

**Comparison - 1920s Light Cruisers:**
| Class | Nation | Ships | Displacement | Main Guns | Speed |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Sendai** | **Japan** | **3** | **5,195** | **7× 5.5"** | **35 kn** |
| Nagara | Japan | 6 | 5,170 | 7× 5.5" | 36 kn |
| Omaha | USA | 10 | 7,050 | 12× 6" | 35 kn |
| Leander | UK | 8 | 7,270 | 8× 6" | 32.5 kn |

**Tactical Legacy:**
- Demonstrated effectiveness and vulnerability of night-fighting tactics
- Searchlights effective pre-radar, suicidal after radar
- Jintsu's sacrifice enabled destroyer torpedo success
- All three showed courage in desperate battles
- Night actions in Solomons among bloodiest of war

**Wreck of Naka:**
- Sunk in Truk Lagoon, shallow water
- Remains as dive site today
- Well-preserved wreck
- Popular with wreck divers
- Part of Truk Lagoon ghost fleet (40+ wrecks)

**Legacy:** Sendai-class epitomized IJN destroyer flotilla leader role and night-fighting doctrine. All three lost in night surface actions or air attack during Guadalcanal/Solomons campaigns. Jintsu's sacrifice at Kolombangara legendary - illuminated enemy, absorbed punishment, enabled destroyer torpedo attack. Demonstrated both effectiveness and fatal flaws of searchlight tactics. Sendai first major IJN warship sunk at Empress Augusta Bay. Naka's loss at Truk showed vulnerability of bases to carrier air power. All three names became synonymous with night combat courage. Names: Rivers in Japan - Sendai, Jintsu, Naka.

**Historical Significance:** Sendai-class showed transition from 1920s design to WWII combat realities. Pre-war night-fighting doctrine worked against equally-matched opponents but failed against radar-equipped US forces. Three ships, three night/air battle losses showed obsolescence of visual-only fire control. Jintsu became symbol of brave but outdated tactics - searchlights vs radar. Guadalcanal/Solomons campaign consumed all three in seven months (July 1943-February 1944). Represented interwar cruiser generation that bore brunt of Pacific War attrition. Last cruisers with 5.5-inch guns - transition to 6-inch standard.
