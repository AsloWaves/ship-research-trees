**Protected Cruiser Veterans** - Hirado-class were early Japanese protected cruisers. 3 ships commissioned 1912. Medium-sized (5,050 tons), coal-fired, six 6-inch guns. 26 knots. WWI service (Pacific, Indian Ocean). Training and reserve duties 1920s-1930s. All three scrapped 1940 (obsolete). None saw WWII combat. Represented pre-dreadnought protected cruiser design before light cruiser evolution.

**Key Specs:** 5,050/5,595 tons | 463ft | 26 kn | 6× 152mm + 6× 76mm | 51mm deck armor | Coal-fired | 3 ships

**Innovation:** Early protected cruiser design (1910s). "Protected" = armored deck over machinery (vs belt armor). Coal-fired steam turbines (transitional - later ships all-oil). Six 6-inch guns in single mounts. Three submerged torpedo tubes. 26 knots (adequate for era). WWI service in Pacific and Indian Ocean theaters. Training cruisers 1920s-1930s. All three survived WWI, scrapped 1940 (obsolete before WWII started). Showed transition from armored cruisers to modern light cruisers. Last coal-fired Japanese cruisers.

**Design:** Medium hull (463 ft, 5,050 tons). Six single 6-inch guns (centerline and broadside positions). Six 3-inch AA guns (added later). Three 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes. Protected cruiser design: 2-inch armored deck over machinery (main protection), minimal belt armor. Coal-fired boilers (4,500 nm range). Two-shaft turbines (26 knots - slower than modern cruisers). Crew 450. Pre-dreadnought construction - riveted hull, reciprocating machinery alongside turbines.

**Ships (3 built - all scrapped):**

**All survived WWI, scrapped 1940:**
1. **Hirado** - Scrapped 1940
2. **Yahagi** - Scrapped 1940 (not same as later WWII cruiser Yahagi)
3. **Tone** - Scrapped 1940 (not same as later WWII heavy cruiser Tone)

**Construction:**
- **Hirado:** Commissioned July 30, 1912
- **Yahagi:** Commissioned November 27, 1912
- **Tone:** Commissioned March 31, 1910 (actually completed earlier than others, lead ship)

**Service History:**

**Pre-WWI (1910-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training cruises
- China station patrols
- Preparation for expected war

**WWI (1914-1918):**

**Pacific Theater:**
- Japanese naval operations against German colonies
- Capture of German Pacific islands
- Convoy escort
- Search for German commerce raiders

**Indian Ocean:**
- Sent to support British/ANZAC forces
- Anti-commerce raider patrols
- Convoy protection (troop transports)
- Based at Singapore
- **Limited combat** (few German surface ships in area)

**Interwar Period (1919-1940):**

**1919-1930:**
- Training cruisers (cadet training)
- Reserve fleet status
- By 1920 already obsolete (coal-fired)
- Washington Naval Treaty (1922): Tonnage limits but old cruisers exempt initially
- Continued training missions

**1930-1940:**
- Reserve fleet
- Minimal operations (deteriorating condition)
- Training only (harbor duties)
- **1940:** All three scrapped (obsolete, worn out, WWII approaching)

**Why Scrapped 1940:**

**Technical Obsolescence:**
1. **Coal-fired:** All modern cruisers oil-fired by 1920
2. **Speed:** 26 knots slow (modern 33+ knots)
3. **Armament:** 6-inch guns in single mounts obsolete (modern twins/triples)
4. **Protection:** Protected cruiser design obsolete (modern light cruisers unarmored but faster)
5. **Age:** 28-30 years old by 1940

**Strategic:**
1. **WWII approaching:** Japan needed modern cruisers, not WWI relics
2. **Resources:** Steel/crew better used elsewhere
3. **Maintenance:** Increasingly expensive to maintain
4. **No combat value:** Would be liabilities in modern war

**Result:**
- All three scrapped 1940
- Good decision - would have been useless in WWII
- Freed crews and resources for modern ships

**Protected Cruiser Design:**

**Concept:**
- Armored deck over machinery and magazines (2 inches)
- Minimal or no belt armor on sides
- Protection from plunging fire (shells hitting deck)
- Lighter than armored cruisers
- Faster, longer range

**Hirado-Class:**
- 2-inch armored deck
- Slopes on deck sides (deflect shells)
- Minimal belt (2 inches on slopes only)
- Protected magazines and engines
- Adequate for era but obsolete by 1920s

**Problems:**
- No protection vs broadside fire (belt needed)
- Heavy deck weight (topweight issues)
- Complex construction
- By 1920s: Unarmored light cruisers faster, more effective

**Coal-Fired Limitations:**

**Why Coal in 1912:**
- Standard for era
- Proven technology
- Japan had coal supplies
- Oil technology new

**Problems by 1920s:**
1. **Smoke:** Reveals position (tactical liability)
2. **Range:** Less energy-dense than oil
3. **Speed:** Slower refueling
4. **Labor:** Coal handling crew needed
5. **Dirt:** Affects machinery, crew morale

**Why Scrapped vs Converted to Oil:**
- Conversion expensive (boiler replacement)
- Hull design optimized for coal bunkers
- Not worth investment given age
- Better to build new oil-fired cruisers

**Comparison - Early Light Cruisers:**
| Class | Ships | Commissioned | Displacement | Speed | Fate |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|------|
| **Hirado** | **3** | **1910-12** | **5,050 tons** | **26 kn** | **All scrapped 1940** |
| Tenryu | 2 | 1919 | 3,948 tons | 33 kn | Both lost WWII |
| Kuma | 5 | 1920-21 | 5,500 tons | 36 kn | 4 lost WWII |

**Hirado: Slowest, oldest, scrapped before WWII**

**WWI Service:**

**Limited Combat:**
- Pacific theater quiet (German squadron already destroyed 1914)
- Indian Ocean: Few German raiders
- Convoy escort main duty
- No major battles
- Peacetime-like operations mostly

**Strategic Value:**
- Presence deterrent (German raiders avoided)
- Convoy protection (troop transports)
- British cooperation (supported Allies)
- Training for crew (modern warfare concepts)

**Name Reuse:**

**Yahagi and Tone names later used:**
- **Yahagi (Agano-class light cruiser):** Commissioned 1943, sunk April 7, 1945 (Operation Ten-Go with Yamato)
- **Tone (heavy cruiser):** Commissioned 1938, sunk July 24, 1945 (air raid at Kure)

**Hirado name:** Not reused (less famous)

**Legacy:** Hirado-class represented early Japanese protected cruiser design. Three ships (1910-1912) served WWI in Pacific and Indian Ocean. Coal-fired, six 6-inch guns, 26 knots. Protected cruiser concept (armored deck, minimal belt). Training cruisers 1920s-1930s as technology advanced beyond them. All three scrapped 1940 (obsolete, worn out) before WWII - good decision given limitations. Last coal-fired Japanese cruisers. Showed transition from protected cruisers to modern light cruisers (Tenryu, Kuma onwards). Names: Hirado (city), Yahagi (river), Tone (river) - later two names reused for famous WWII cruisers.

**Historical Significance:** Hirado-class bridged eras - built as protected cruisers (pre-dreadnought concept), obsolete by dreadnought era. Coal-fired in increasingly oil-fired world. Scrapped 1940 showed Japanese Navy's wisdom - recognized futility of using 30-year-old coal cruisers in WWII. Compare to keeping Kaba-class destroyers for WWII (disaster). Hirado-class retirement avoided such fate. Represented last generation before modern light cruiser revolution (Tenryu 1919: 33 knots, oil-fired). WWI service quiet - Pacific theater had little combat after 1914. Training role 1920s-1930s justified continued existence. Names Yahagi and Tone later given to famous WWII cruisers - original ships forgotten but names remembered.
