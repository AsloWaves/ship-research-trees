**Early Domestic Destroyers** - Shinonome-class were early Japanese destroyers built domestically. 4 ships commissioned 1905. Very small (360 tons), coal-fired reciprocating engines. Two 3-inch guns + four 18-inch torpedoes. 29 knots. Russo-Japanese War era design. All four scrapped 1924-1928 (obsolete). None survived to WWII. Showed Japan's early destroyer construction capability - domestic yards building own designs after learning from British (Amatsukaze-class).

**Key Specs:** 360/430 tons | 223ft | 29 kn | 2× 76mm + 4× 450mm torpedoes | Coal reciprocating | 4 ships

**Innovation:** Early domestically-built Japanese destroyers (vs British-built Amatsukaze-class). Commissioned 1905 for Russo-Japanese War service. Tiny (360 tons - similar to foreign-built contemporaries). Coal-fired reciprocating engines. Two 3-inch guns. Four 18-inch torpedoes (two twin mounts). 29 knots (adequate for 1905). Showed Japanese yards learning destroyer construction - applied lessons from British ships. All four scrapped 1924-1928 (20+ years service). None worth keeping for WWII. Represented transition from buying foreign ships to building domestic - foundation for later Japanese destroyer excellence.

**Design:** Very small hull (223 ft, 360 tons). Two single 3-inch guns (fore and aft). Four 18-inch torpedo tubes (two twin mounts amidships). No AA guns. Coal-fired reciprocating engines (vertical triple expansion). Two shafts. 29 knots. Limited range (1,500 nm). Unarmored. Crew 60. Basic construction - early Japanese destroyer building. Similar to British designs but domestically built - Japanese yards learning craft.

**Ships (4 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1924-1928:**
1. **Shinonome** - Scrapped 1924
2. **Usugumo** - Scrapped 1924
3. **Oboro** - Scrapped 1928
4. **Akebono** - Scrapped 1928

**Construction:**
- Builders: Japanese naval yards (domestic construction)
- Laid down: 1904
- Commissioned: 1905
- Russo-Japanese War program

**Service History:**

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
- Commissioned during/after war
- Limited combat participation
- Torpedo boat defense
- Fleet screening
- Learning modern destroyer operations

**Post-War / Pre-WWI (1906-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- China station patrols
- Already becoming obsolete (larger destroyers building)

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Reserve status
- Coastal patrol
- Training duties
- Too small for fleet operations

**Post-WWI (1919-1928):**
- Reserve fleet
- Completely obsolete
- **Scrapped 1924-1928**
- 20-23 years service

**Domestic vs Foreign Construction:**

**Learning Process:**

**Foreign-Built (Amatsukaze-class 1905):**
- British Yarrow design
- Built in UK
- High quality
- Technology demonstration
- **Japan learned from these**

**Domestic-Built (Shinonome-class 1905):**
- Japanese design (based on British patterns)
- Built in Japan
- Quality adequate
- **Japan applied lessons**
- Beginning of domestic capability

**Result:**
- By 1910s: Japan building own destroyers confidently
- By 1920s: Japanese destroyer designs competitive
- By 1928: Fubuki-class revolutionary (world's best)
- **Foundation:** Early domestic builds like Shinonome

**Why All Scrapped 1924-1928:**

**Same Issues as All Early Destroyers:**
1. **Age:** 20+ years old
2. **Size:** 360 tons (tiny vs 1,500-2,000 ton modern)
3. **Technology:** Coal, reciprocating engines
4. **Speed:** 29 knots (modern 35+ knots)
5. **Obsolete:** No military value

**Scrapping Timeline:**
- Shinonome, Usugumo: 1924 (19 years service)
- Oboro, Akebono: 1928 (23 years service)
- Later two lasted longer (better condition or reserve needs)

**Comparison - Early Domestic vs Foreign Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Built | Where | Year | Fate |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|------|
| **Shinonome** | **4** | **Domestic** | **Japan** | **1905** | **Scrapped 1920s** |
| Amatsukaze | 2 | Foreign | UK | 1905 | Scrapped 1920s |
| Hatsu | 6 | Domestic | Japan | 1905-06 | Scrapped 1920s |

**Shinonome: Early domestic construction capability**

**20-Year Service Life:**

**Typical for Era:**
- Pre-WWI destroyers: 15-25 years normal
- **Shinonome-class: 19-23 years**
- Good service life for era
- Technology evolved beyond them
- Natural retirement

**Legacy:** Shinonome-class represented early Japanese domestic destroyer construction. Four small ships (360 tons) commissioned 1905. Built in Japanese yards - showed learning from British designs (Amatsukaze-class). Coal-fired, two 3-inch guns, four 18-inch torpedoes, 29 knots. Russo-Japanese War era. All four scrapped 1924-1928 (20+ years service). None survived to WWII. Foundation for Japanese destroyer evolution - from 360-ton coal boats (1905) to 2,000-ton revolutionary Fubukis (1928). Early domestic builds proved Japanese capability. Names: Morning/dawn phenomena (Shinonome=Dawn Clouds, Usugumo=Thin Clouds, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Shinonome-class marked Japan's transition from buying foreign destroyers to building domestic. Same year as British-built Amatsukaze-class (1905), but Shinonome-class built in Japan. Quality adequate, showing Japanese yards learning fast. Within 23 years (1905-1928), Japan evolved from copying British 360-ton boats to building revolutionary Fubuki-class (1,980 tons, world's best). Shinonome-class: Humble beginning, necessary step. All four scrapped 1924-1928 (obsolete but honorable service). Compare evolution: Shinonome (1905, domestic copy of British) → Fubuki (1928, revolutionary original design exceeding British) = mastery in one generation. Shows Japanese industrial learning speed. Shinonome forgotten but essential - couldn't build Fubuki without learning from Shinonome.
