**Russo-Japanese War Era** - Hatsu-class were very early Japanese destroyers. 6 ships commissioned 1905-1906 during/after Russo-Japanese War. Tiny (375 tons), coal-fired reciprocating engines, two 3-inch guns + four 18-inch torpedoes. 29 knots. Torpedo boat destroyers (original destroyer role). WWI coastal patrol. All six scrapped 1924-1928 (obsolete). None survived to WWII. Represented Japanese destroyer program's earliest generation - before mass production, before modern concepts.

**Key Specs:** 375/450 tons | 226ft | 29 kn | 2× 76mm + 4× 450mm torpedoes | Coal-fired reciprocating | 6 ships

**Innovation:** Very early destroyer design from Russo-Japanese War era (1904-1905). "Torpedo boat destroyers" - designed to defend battlefleet from enemy torpedo boats while launching own torpedo attacks. Tiny (375 tons - torpedo boat size). Coal-fired reciprocating engines (not even turbines). Two 3-inch guns. Four 18-inch torpedoes. 29 knots (good for era). Served Russo-Japanese War and WWI. Rapidly obsolete - by 1920 completely outclassed. All six scrapped 1924-1928. None worth keeping for WWII. Showed Japanese Navy's destroyer evolution starting point - tiny coal-fired boats to modern fleet destroyers.

**Design:** Very small hull (226 ft, 375 tons - barely larger than torpedo boat). Two single 3-inch guns (fore and aft). Four 18-inch torpedo tubes (two twin mounts amidships). No AA guns (concept didn't exist yet). Coal-fired reciprocating steam engines (vertical triple expansion). Two shafts. 29 knots maximum. Limited range (1,500 nm - coastal operations). Unarmored. Crew 60. Very simple construction - riveted hull, basic systems, minimal equipment. Designed for torpedo attack and torpedo boat defense - original destroyer role.

**Ships (6 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1924-1928:**
1. **Hatsu** - Scrapped 1924
2. **Hayatori** - Scrapped 1925
3. **Asagiri** - Scrapped 1925 (not same as later WWII Ayanami-class Asagiri)
4. **Murakumo** - Scrapped 1928
5. **Shinonome** - Scrapped 1928
6. **Usugumo** - Scrapped 1928

**Construction:**
- Laid down: 1904-1905
- Commissioned: 1905-1906
- Russo-Japanese War program

**Service History:**

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
- Later ships commissioned near war's end
- Limited combat participation
- Torpedo boat defense
- Fleet screening
- Training for larger destroyers

**Post-War / Pre-WWI (1906-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Coastal patrol
- Torpedo tactics development
- Already becoming obsolete (larger destroyers building)

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Coastal defense
- Harbor patrol
- Training duties
- Too small for fleet operations
- Pacific theater quiet anyway

**Post-WWI (1919-1928):**
- Reserve fleet
- Obsolete by any standard
- **Scrapped 1924-1928** (worn out, too small, too old)
- No value even for training

**Why Scrapped 1924-1928:**

**Technical Obsolescence:**
1. **Size:** 375 tons (modern destroyers 1,500-2,000 tons)
2. **Coal:** Obsolete fuel by 1920s
3. **Engines:** Reciprocating (modern: turbines)
4. **Speed:** 29 knots (modern: 35+ knots)
5. **Armament:** 3-inch guns, 18-inch torpedoes (obsolete calibers)
6. **Age:** 20+ years old

**Not Worth Keeping:**
- Too small for any useful role
- Maintenance expensive (obsolete parts)
- Crews better used elsewhere
- Scrapping made sense

**Russo-Japanese War Context:**

**War (1904-1905):**
- Japan vs Russia
- Naval battles: Tsushima, Yellow Sea
- Destroyers proved valuable
- Torpedo attacks effective
- Japan learned modern naval warfare

**Hatsu-Class Role:**
- Built during war
- Commissioned near war's end or after
- Limited combat
- But: Validated destroyer concept
- Led to larger classes

**Torpedo Boat Destroyer Concept:**

**Original Purpose:**
- **Enemy torpedo boats:** Small, fast, armed with torpedoes
- **Threat:** Could sink battleships
- **Counter:** "Torpedo boat destroyers" - fast ships to hunt torpedo boats
- **Armament:** Guns to sink torpedo boats + torpedoes to attack enemy fleet

**Hatsu-Class:**
- Fulfilled this role
- 29 knots caught torpedo boats
- 3-inch guns sank torpedo boats
- 18-inch torpedoes attacked fleet
- But: Concept evolved quickly to "destroyer" (general purpose)

**Coal Reciprocating Engines:**

**Technology:**
- Vertical triple expansion steam engines
- Coal-fired boilers
- No turbines (Dreadnought introduced turbines 1906)
- Proven but obsolete

**Problems:**
- Less efficient than turbines
- Less smooth (vibration)
- Less powerful
- Coal limitations (smoke, labor)
- By 1910s: All new destroyers had turbines

**Comparison - Early Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | Engines | Fate |
|-------|-------|------|------|---------|------|
| **Hatsu** | **6** | **1905** | **375** | **Recip** | **Scrapped 1920s** |
| Umikaze | 6 | 1911 | 380 | Turbines | Scrapped 1930s |
| Sakura | 18 | 1912 | 420 | Turbines | Scrapped 1930s |
| Kaba | 10 | 1915 | 665 | Turbines | 6 scrapped, 4 lost WWII |

**Hatsu: Smallest, oldest, earliest scrapped**

**Why 20-Year Service Life:**

**Typical for Era:**
- Pre-WWI ships: 15-25 years normal
- Technology evolved rapidly
- Ships obsolete quickly
- Hatsu: 1905-1928 = 23 years (typical)

**Modern Ships:**
- WWII ships: 30-40+ years common
- Better construction
- Modernization possible
- But: Hatsu too small/primitive to modernize

**Legacy:** Hatsu-class represented Japanese destroyer program's earliest stage. Six tiny ships (375 tons) commissioned 1905-1906 during/after Russo-Japanese War. Coal-fired reciprocating engines, two 3-inch guns, four 18-inch torpedoes. Torpedo boat destroyers - defended fleet from torpedo boats, launched own attacks. 29 knots. Rapidly obsolete as technology advanced. All six scrapped 1924-1928 (20+ years service). None survived to WWII. Showed Japanese Navy learning destroyer concepts - from 375-ton coal boats (1905) to 2,000-ton turbine fleet destroyers (Fubuki, 1928) in 23 years. Names: Hatsu (First), Hayatori (Falcon), Asagiri (Morning Mist), etc.

**Historical Significance:** Hatsu-class marked beginning of Japanese destroyer evolution. Built 1905-1906 for Russo-Japanese War - validated destroyer concept. But tiny (375 tons), coal-fired, reciprocating engines - primitive even for era. By 1920 hopelessly obsolete - modern destroyers 4× larger, turbine-powered, oil-fired. All six scrapped 1924-1928 - sensible given age and size. Compare to evolution: Hatsu (1905, 375 tons, coal, 29 knots) → Fubuki (1928, 1,980 tons, oil, 38 knots) = revolutionary change in 23 years. Hatsu-class forgotten - overshadowed by later famous classes. But necessary first step - Japan learned destroyer operations with Hatsu before building world-class destroyers like Fubuki. Represented humble beginnings before greatness.
