**WWI Veterans** - Kaba-class were Japan's first mass-produced destroyers. 10 ships commissioned 1915-1916. Small (665 tons), slow (30 knots), lightly armed (three 4.7-inch guns + six torpedoes). Coal/oil mixed firing (transitional technology). WWI convoy escort and patrol duties. Most scrapped 1932 (treaty limitations). Four survived to WWII - all lost 1942-1944. Showed obsolescence - WWI-era ships facing WWII combat. Last lost 1944 (29 years old). Represented Japanese destroyer origins.

**Key Specs:** 665/850 tons | 269ft | 30 kn | 3× 120mm + 6× 533mm torpedoes | Coal/oil mixed | 10 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese mass-produced destroyers (10 built WWI). Small, simple design for rapid construction. Three single 4.7-inch guns. Six torpedo tubes (three twin mounts). Mixed coal/oil firing (transitional - later ships all-oil). 30 knots (adequate for WWI). WWI convoy escort. Most scrapped 1932 under treaty limits (older ships eliminated). Four survived to WWII but hopelessly obsolete - slow, lightly armed, old. All four WWII survivors lost 1942-1944. Showed 29-year service span (1915-1944) - WWI technology fighting WWII war (unsuitable). Represented Japanese destroyer evolution starting point.

**Design:** Small hull (269 ft, 665 tons). Three single 4.7-inch guns (one forward, two aft). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes (three twin mounts amidships). No AA guns originally (added minimal AA before WWII). Coal/oil mixed firing boilers (coal primary, oil supplementary - transition technology). Two-shaft turbines (30 knots). Limited range (2,400 nm). Unarmored. Crew 92. Simple WWI construction - riveted, basic systems. Adequate for WWI but obsolete by 1930s.

**Construction:**
- Builders: Multiple naval yards
- Laid down: 1914-1915
- Commissioned: 1915-1916
- Wartime emergency construction (WWI)

**Service History:**

**WWI Service (1915-1918):**
- Convoy escort (Pacific)
- Anti-submarine patrols
- Japanese merchant protection
- Limited combat (German East Asia Squadron already destroyed)
- Training duties

**Interwar Period (1919-1941):**

**1919-1930:**
- Training ships
- Reserve fleet
- Patrol duties
- Local defense

**1930-1932:**
- **Washington/London Naval Treaties:** Tonnage limits
- Japan needed to reduce destroyer numbers
- Older ships targeted for scrapping
- **6 of 10 Kaba-class scrapped 1932**
- Newest/best-maintained kept (Kaki, Tsuga, Nire, Kuri)

**1932-1941:**
- Four survivors relegated to secondary duties
- Training
- Patrol
- Minesweeping
- Harbor defense
- Not considered frontline warships

**WWII Service (1941-1944):**

**Four Survivors:**
- Hopelessly obsolete by 1941
- 26 years old at Pearl Harbor
- Small, slow, lightly armed
- But: Japan desperate for any escorts

**Kaki (1941-1943):**

**1941-1942:**
- Convoy escort (rear areas)
- Minesweeping
- Patrol duties (safe waters)
- Not risked in frontline combat

**1943:**
- Pressed into forward convoy duty (ship shortage)
- Solomons area (dangerous waters)

**January 18, 1943:**
- **USS Guardfish (SS-217)** on patrol
- Detected Kaki escorting convoy
- Fired torpedoes
- **Hit Kaki**
- **Sank**
- **45 killed, 47 survivors**
- 28 years old at sinking

**Nire (1941-1942):**

**1941-early 1942:**
- Convoy escort (Dutch East Indies)
- Troop transport support
- Limited combat capability

**July 22, 1942:**
- Off New Guinea
- **Allied air attack** (B-17 or B-25 bombers)
- No effective AA defense (minimal AA guns)
- **Hit by bombs**
- **Sank**
- **31 killed, 61 survivors**
- 27 years old at sinking

**Tsuga (1941-1944):**

**1941-1943:**
- Convoy escort (Southeast Asia)
- Minesweeping duties
- Training ship occasionally

**1944:**
- Pressed into Philippine Sea operations (desperation)
- Inadequate for modern combat

**June 20, 1944:**
- Philippine Sea
- **Allied air attack** (carrier aircraft)
- No chance against modern aircraft
- **Hit by bombs/strafing**
- **Sank with all hands** (~92 killed)
- 29 years old - oldest ship lost

**Kuri (1941-1944):**

**1941-1943:**
- Convoy escort (South China Sea)
- Troop transport support
- Minesweeping

**May 18, 1944:**
- Sulu Sea (Philippines)
- **USS Bonefish (SS-223)** on patrol
- Detected Kuri
- Fired torpedoes
- **Hit and sank Kuri**
- **All hands lost** (~92 killed)
- 29 years old at sinking

**Loss Statistics:**

**10 built:**
- **6 scrapped pre-war (1932)** - treaty reduction
- **4 survived to WWII, all lost 1942-1944 (100% WWII loss rate)**

**WWII Causes:**
- Submarine: 2 ships (Kaki, Kuri)
- Air attack: 2 ships (Nire, Tsuga)

**Total WWII casualties:** ~270 killed (45 + 31 + 92 + 92)

**Why WWII Survivors Lost:**
1. **Obsolete:** 26-29 years old by WWII
2. **Slow:** 30 knots (1916) vs 35+ knots (modern destroyers)
3. **Lightly armed:** Three 4.7-inch guns vs modern six 5-inch
4. **No AA:** Minimal AA guns (1940s air threat fatal)
5. **Worn out:** Decades of service, poor maintenance
6. **Misused:** Frontline duty despite limitations

**Coal/Oil Mixed Firing:**

**Technology:**
- **Primary:** Coal-fired boilers
- **Supplementary:** Oil spray for boost
- **Transitional:** Between all-coal (pre-WWI) and all-oil (post-WWI)

**Problems:**
- Coal slower to load
- Dirtier (smoke reveals position)
- Labor-intensive (coal handlers needed)
- Less efficient than pure oil

**By WWII:**
- All modern destroyers all-oil
- Kaba-class coal/oil system ancient
- Maintenance nightmare

**Treaty Scrapping (1932):**

**Context:**
- London Naval Treaty (1930): Destroyer tonnage limits
- Japan had too many destroyers (tonnage exceeded limit)
- Solution: Scrap oldest ships

**Kaba-class:**
- 10 ships, 6,650 tons total
- **6 scrapped:** Freed 3,990 tons
- Allowed newer destroyers to be built
- **4 kept:** Best condition, used for training/patrol
- Ironic: Kept ships later lost in WWII

**Comparison - WWI Destroyers in WWII:**
| Class | Nation | Commissioned | WWII Service | Fate |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|------|
| **Kaba** | **Japan** | **1915-16** | **4 ships** | **All lost** |
| Clemson | USA | 1919-22 | 50+ ships | Most survived (rear areas) |
| V/W | UK | 1917-19 | 40+ ships | Many survived (escorts) |

**Kaba: Oldest destroyers in WWII combat (29 years)**

**Why All Four WWII Survivors Lost:**
1. **Age:** 26-29 years old (ancient for warships)
2. **Technology:** WWI-era vs WWII threats
3. **Speed:** 30 knots inadequate to escape
4. **Armament:** 3 guns couldn't defend vs air/sub
5. **Japan desperate:** Used everything available
6. **Allied superiority:** By 1942-1944 overwhelming

**Legacy:** Kaba-class represented Japanese destroyer origins. Ten ships commissioned WWI (1915-1916). Small, simple, coal/oil mixed firing. First mass-produced Japanese destroyers. Six scrapped 1932 (treaty limits). Four survived to WWII but hopelessly obsolete - all lost 1942-1944 at ages 27-29. Tsuga lost June 1944 at 29 years old (probably oldest destroyer lost in WWII combat). Showed impossibility of WWI technology vs WWII warfare. Coal/oil firing, slow speed, light armament fatal. Names: Trees (Kaba=Birch, Keyaki=Zelkova, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Kaba-class showed limits of warship service life. Built WWI (1915-1916) for convoy escort. Adequate for WWI but obsolete by 1930 (treaty scrapping eliminated 6 of 10). Four survivors pressed into WWII duty - catastrophic mistake. 26-29 years old, coal/oil firing, 30 knots, three 4.7-inch guns vs modern threats. All four lost 1942-1944 - Tsuga at 29 years old (probably oldest destroyer in WWII combat). Showed Japan's desperation - using WWI relics because modern ships mostly sunk. Compare to US/UK: Also used WWI destroyers but in rear areas only. Japan used Kaba-class in combat zones - inevitable losses. Represented wrong ships, wrong war, wrong time. But Japan had no choice - every hull needed.
