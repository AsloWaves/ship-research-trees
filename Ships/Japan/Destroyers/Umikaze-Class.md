**Early Torpedo Boats** - Umikaze-class were early Japanese destroyers. 6 ships commissioned 1911. Tiny (380 tons), coal-fired, lightly armed (two 3-inch guns + four 18-inch torpedoes). 33 knots. Pre-WWI/WWI service. Convoy escort and patrol. All scrapped 1932-1936 (obsolete and treaty limits). None survived to WWII. Showed Japanese destroyer program beginnings - small torpedo boats before evolution to larger fleet destroyers.

**Key Specs:** 380/450 tons | 228ft | 33 kn | 2× 76mm + 4× 450mm torpedoes | Coal-fired | 6 ships

**Innovation:** Early Japanese destroyer design (1910-1911). Very small (380 tons - torpedo boat size). Coal-fired steam turbines. Two 3-inch guns. Four 18-inch torpedo tubes. 33 knots (good speed for era). Pre-WWI construction. WWI convoy escort and patrol duties. Limited combat (Pacific theater quiet). Training and reserve duties 1920s. All scrapped 1932-1936 (obsolete technology, Washington Treaty tonnage limits). None survived to WWII (too old). Represented Japanese destroyer evolution starting point - before Kaba-class mass production and Fubuki-class revolution.

**Design:** Small hull (228 ft, 380 tons - closer to torpedo boat than destroyer). Two single 3-inch guns (one forward, one aft). Four 18-inch torpedo tubes (two twin mounts amidships). No AA guns. Coal-fired boilers (pre-oil technology). Two-shaft turbines (33 knots - fast for 1911). Very limited range (1,800 nm). Unarmored. Crew 70. Simple construction for rapid building. Adequate for 1911 but obsolete by 1920s.

**Ships (6 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1930s:**
1. **Umikaze** - Scrapped 1932
2. **Yamakaze** - Scrapped 1932
3. **Nowaki** - Scrapped 1933
4. **Kawakaze** - Scrapped 1933
5. **Suzukaze** - Scrapped 1936
6. **Tanikaze** - Scrapped 1936 (not same as later WWII Tanikaze)

**Construction:**
- Builders: Japanese naval yards
- Laid down: 1910
- Commissioned: 1911
- Pre-WWI emergency program

**Service History:**

**Pre-WWI (1911-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Torpedo tactics development
- Patrol duties
- Training for larger destroyer concepts

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Convoy escort (Pacific)
- Anti-submarine patrols (limited)
- Merchant protection
- Training (mostly - Pacific quiet during WWI)

**Interwar Period (1919-1936):**

**1919-1930:**
- Reserve fleet status
- Training ships
- By 1920 already obsolete (newer destroyers superior)
- Minimal operations
- Harbor patrol only

**1930-1936: Treaty Scrapping:**
- **Washington Naval Treaty (1922):** Destroyer tonnage limits
- **London Naval Treaty (1930):** Further restrictions
- Japan needed to reduce destroyer numbers
- Oldest ships targeted
- **All 6 Umikaze-class scrapped 1932-1936**
- Freed tonnage for modern destroyers (Fubuki-class etc.)

**Why All Scrapped:**
1. **Age:** 21-25 years old by scrapping (ancient for destroyers)
2. **Technology:** Coal-fired (obsolete by 1930)
3. **Size:** 380 tons (tiny - inadequate for modern combat)
4. **Armament:** 3-inch guns, 18-inch torpedoes (obsolete calibers)
5. **Treaty limits:** Japan needed tonnage for modern ships
6. **Condition:** Worn out from 20+ years service

**Coal-Fired Technology:**

**Why Coal in 1911:**
- Standard for era
- Oil technology new
- Coal widely available in Japan
- Proven reliability

**Problems:**
- Labor-intensive (coal handling crew needed)
- Dirty (smoke reveals position)
- Slower to refuel
- Less energy-dense than oil
- By 1920s: All new ships oil-fired

**Comparison - Early Japanese Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Commissioned | Displacement | Fuel | Fate |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|------|------|
| **Umikaze** | **6** | **1911** | **380 tons** | **Coal** | **All scrapped 1932-36** |
| Kaba | 10 | 1915-16 | 665 tons | Coal/oil | 6 scrapped 1932, 4 lost WWII |
| Momi | 21 | 1919-22 | 850 tons | Oil | 13 scrapped 1930s, 8 lost WWII |

**Umikaze: Smallest, oldest, earliest scrapped**

**18-inch Torpedoes:**

**Specification:**
- 450mm (18-inch) diameter
- Standard for era (1910s)
- By 1920s: 21-inch (533mm) standard
- By 1930s: 24-inch (610mm) Long Lance developed

**Umikaze Obsolescence:**
- 18-inch torpedoes obsolete by 1920
- Smaller warhead than 21-inch
- Shorter range
- Could not be upgraded to 21-inch (different tube size)

**Treaty Scrapping Context:**

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Limited battleships/cruisers primarily
- But destroyer tonnage also restricted
- Japan: 105,500 tons total destroyers allowed

**Problem:**
- Japan had 130,000+ tons of destroyers (over limit)
- Solution: Scrap oldest ships
- **Umikaze-class:** 2,280 tons total (6 ships × 380 tons)

**Result:**
- All 6 scrapped 1932-1936
- Freed tonnage for Fubuki-class (1,980 tons each)
- Strategic choice: Six 380-ton torpedo boats vs three 1,980-ton modern destroyers
- Modern ships more valuable

**Why None Survived to WWII:**

**Unlike Kaba-class (4 survived to WWII):**
- **Age:** Umikaze even older (1911 vs 1915)
- **Size:** Smaller (380 vs 665 tons)
- **Technology:** Pure coal (vs coal/oil mixed)
- **Condition:** Worse (older, more worn)
- **Value:** Lower (tiny, obsolete)

**Result:**
- All scrapped 1932-1936
- Good decision - would have been useless in WWII
- Even Kaba-class (larger, newer) suffered 100% WWII losses

**Legacy:** Umikaze-class represented early Japanese destroyer development. Six tiny ships (380 tons) commissioned 1911. Coal-fired, two 3-inch guns, four 18-inch torpedoes. 33 knots. Pre-WWI/WWI service in Pacific. Limited combat (Pacific quiet). All scrapped 1932-1936 (obsolete technology, treaty limits, worn out). None survived to WWII. Showed Japanese destroyer evolution starting point before Kaba-class (WWI) and Fubuki-class (revolutionary 1920s). Names: Wind types (Umikaze=Sea Wind, Yamakaze=Mountain Wind, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Umikaze-class showed Japanese destroyer program origins. Built 1911 as small coal-fired torpedo boats (380 tons). Adequate for 1911 but obsolete by 1920s. All six scrapped 1932-1936 - sensible decision given age, size, technology. Compare to Kaba-class: Some Kabas kept for WWII (disaster - all lost). Umikaze-class scrapped earlier avoided such fate. Represented transition era - coal to oil, torpedo boats to fleet destroyers. By time Fubuki-class commissioned (1928), Umikaze-class already museum pieces. 21-25 year service life typical for era (vs 10-15 years modern). None remembered today - overshadowed by later revolutionary designs like Fubuki, Kagero, etc. But necessary step in Japanese destroyer evolution.
