**Torpedo Masters** - Shiratsuyu-class were improved Hatsuharu-class destroyers. 10 ships built 1936-1937. Five 5-inch guns + eight 24-inch torpedoes in new quad mounts. All 10 lost in combat 1942-1945 (100% casualty rate). Shigure became "lucky ship" - survived multiple disasters that destroyed entire squadrons.

**Key Specs:** 1,712/2,380 tons | 347ft | 34 kn | 5× 127mm + 8× 610mm Type 93 torpedoes + 28× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 10 ships

**Innovation:** First IJN destroyers with new quad 24-inch torpedo mounts (Type 92 launcher). Improved stability over Hatsuharu-class (which had severe topweight problems). Better hull form. Five single 5-inch guns (centerline arrangement). Good seakeeping. Standard destroyer for late 1930s. All 10 participated extensively in Guadalcanal and Philippines campaigns. 100% loss rate showed heavy attrition.

**Design:** Five single 5-inch guns (three forward, two aft - all centerline). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers amidships. Good speed (34 knots). Light displacement (1,712 tons). Depth charges for ASW. Light AA (increased during war). Unarmored for speed and maneuverability. Typical late-1930s IJN destroyer design.

**Comparison - 1930s Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Displacement | Guns | Torpedoes | Loss Rate |
|-------|-------|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Shiratsuyu** | **10** | **1,712** | **5× 5"** | **8× 24"** | **100%** |
| Asashio | 10 | 1,961 | 6× 5" | 8× 24" | 100% |
| Fletcher | 175 | 2,050 | 5× 5" | 10× 21" | ~10% |

**Why 100% Loss Rate:**
1. **Extensive combat:** All 10 saw heavy action
2. **Guadalcanal attrition:** Multiple ships lost in Solomons
3. **Submarine warfare:** 50% sunk by subs
4. **No survivors:** War lasted too long for any to survive
5. **Aggressive employment:** Tokyo Express, night actions

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Tokyo Express:** Fast supply runs to Guadalcanal
- **Night surface actions:** Torpedo attacks on cruisers
- **Destroyer vs destroyer:** Multiple night battles
- **Convoy escort:** Transport protection
- **ASW:** Depth charge attacks

**Notable Ships:**

**Yudachi - "The Fighting Destroyer":**
- Most aggressive ship in class
- Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (November 13, 1942)
- Charged US battleship line
- Torpedoed USS South Dakota
- Fought multiple US ships simultaneously
- Finally overwhelmed and scuttled
- Legendary for bravery

**Shigure - "The Lucky Destroyer":**
- Survived Vella Gulf (entire squadron destroyed)
- Survived Surigao Strait (entire force destroyed)
- Escaped when all others sunk
- Crew considered blessed
- Finally sunk by submarine 1945
- Most famous Shiratsuyu-class

**Legacy:** Shiratsuyu-class represented mature 1930s destroyer design. First with quad 24-inch torpedo mounts. All 10 lost in combat (100% casualty rate) - one of highest loss rates for any destroyer class. Yudachi's aggressive action at Guadalcanal legendary. Shigure's miraculous survivals made her most famous IJN destroyer after Yukikaze. 100% loss rate demonstrated heavy attrition of IJN destroyer force. Names: Weather phenomena (rain, storms, wind).

**Historical Significance:** Shiratsuyu-class epitomized IJN destroyer employment in Pacific War. Extensive combat in Guadalcanal campaign - Tokyo Express runs, night surface actions. 100% loss rate (all 10 sunk) showed unsustainable attrition. Shigure's legend - surviving three squadron wipeouts - made her immortal in naval history. Yudachi's suicidal charge at battleship line epitomized aggressive spirit. Submarine losses (50%) demonstrated effectiveness of US submarine campaign. Class showed both effectiveness (torpedo attacks successful) and vulnerability (all eventually sunk) of IJN destroyers.
