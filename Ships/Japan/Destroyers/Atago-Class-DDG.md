- Cooperative with US Navy
- Proved capability in tests

**Operational Significance:**
- Can intercept missiles threatening Japan or US bases
- Provides upper-tier defense (Patriot provides lower-tier)
- Integrated air/missile defense network

**Based on Arleigh Burke Flight IIA:**

**US Design Evolution:**
- Flight I (Kongo based on this): 90 VLS, no hangar
- Flight II: 90 VLS, hangar added
- **Flight IIA** (Atago based on this): 96 VLS, full hangar, improved systems

**Atago Modifications:**
- Japanese electronics where possible
- FCS-3A radar (indigenous)
- OPS-28D surface search (Japanese)
- HOS-303 torpedoes (Japanese)
- Some US systems retained (Aegis, VLS, guns)
- Mixture of US and Japanese technology

**Comparison - Japanese Aegis:**
| Class | Year | Tons | VLS | Aegis Version | BMD | Ships |
|-------|------|------|-----|---------------|-----|-------|
| Kongo | 1993-98 | 9,485 | 90 | SPY-1D / J7 | IA/IB | 4 |
| **Atago** | **2007-08** | **10,000** | **96** | **SPY-1D(V) / 7.1** | **IA/IB/IIA** | **2** |
| Maya | 2020-21 | 10,250 | 96 | SPY-1D(V) / J7.B | IIA, SM-6 | 2 |

**Atago: Intermediate generation, larger/more capable than Kongo**

**FCS-3A Radar:**

**Japanese Indigenous:**
- X-band active electronically scanned array (AESA)
- Fire control and surface search
- Mounted on mast
- Supplements Aegis system
- Japanese-developed technology

**Capabilities:**
- Surface target tracking
- Low-altitude air targets
- Small craft detection
- Missile guidance
- Shows Japan's growing radar expertise

**Integration:**
- Works with Aegis system
- Provides additional tracking
- Redundancy (if Aegis damaged)
- Japanese-controlled system

**Only Two Ships - Why?**

**Limited Build:**
- Kongo: 4 ships
- Atago: 2 ships
- Maya: 2 ships (follow-on)
- Total: 8 Aegis destroyers for JMSDF

**Reasons:**
1. **Cost:** ~$1.5 billion each (expensive)
2. **Timing:** Bridge between Kongo and Maya
3. **Capability:** Significant upgrade over Kongo
4. **Force structure:** 8 Aegis destroyers adequate for JMSDF
5. **Evolution:** Testing technologies for Maya-class

**Strategy:**
- Kongo: First generation (learn Aegis)
- Atago: Second generation (improve capability)
- Maya: Third generation (latest technology)
- Continuous evolution rather than mass production

**Names Honor WWII Cruisers:**

**Atago:**
- Original: Takao-class heavy cruiser (1932-1944)
- Flagship of Second Fleet
- Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 23-26, 1944)
- **Sunk October 23, 1944** - torpedoed by USS Darter SS-227
- Went down in 18 minutes, 360 killed
- Admiral Kurita (fleet commander) aboard, transferred to Yamato

**Ashigara:**
- Original: Myoko-class heavy cruiser (1929-1945)
- "Hungry Wolf" nickname (aggressive tactics)
- **Sunk June 8, 1945** - Bangka Strait, torpedoed by HMS Trenchant (British submarine)
- One of last major Japanese warships sunk
- 853 killed

**Honor Through Names:**
- Modern Aegis destroyers carry proud names
- Different missions (heavy cruisers → missile defense)
- Historical continuity
- Warrior tradition

**30+ Years Expected Service:**

**Longevity Projection:**
- Commissioned: 2007-2008
- As of 2025: 17-18 years service
- Expected: 40+ years total
- Service to 2040s-2050s possible with upgrades

**Why Long Service:**
- Modern construction
- Continuous upgrades (BMD improvements)
- Critical capability (Aegis irreplaceable)
- Expensive to replace
- Still highly capable

**Planned Upgrades:**
- SM-6 integration (extended range AAW)
- Cooperative Engagement Capability improvements
- Electronic warfare enhancements
- Combat system software updates
- Possibly SM-3 Block IIA newer variants

**Legacy:** Atago-class represented second-generation Japanese Aegis capability. 2 ships (2007-2008) improved on Kongo-class: Larger (10,000 tons), more VLS (96 vs 90), better radar (SPY-1D(V)), enhanced BMD (SM-3 Block IIA). Based on Arleigh Burke Flight IIA. FCS-3A Japanese indigenous radar. Critical ballistic missile defense role - defend Japan from North Korean/future threats. Both active as of 2025 (17-18 years service). Expected to serve 40+ years with upgrades. Showed continuous Japanese Aegis evolution: Kongo (1993, first) → Atago (2007, improved) → Maya (2020, latest). Names honor WWII heavy cruisers Atago and Ashigara - historical continuity, proud tradition. Atago-class: World-class destroyers, critical defensive capability, decades more service ahead.

**Historical Significance:** Atago-class marked Japan's maturing Aegis capability. First ships (Kongo 1993) proved concept, second generation (Atago 2007) refined capability. Larger, more capable, enhanced BMD with SM-3 Block IIA (US-Japan joint development). Commissioned during period of growing threats: North Korea nuclear/missile programs, China military expansion. Japan responded with world-class naval capability. Both ships named for WWII heavy cruisers sunk in action (Atago at Leyte Gulf 1944, Ashigara by British submarine 1945) - shows Japanese embrace of naval heritage even as Maritime Self-Defense Force (not "navy"). Technology blend: US Aegis system, Japanese FCS-3A radar, mixed weapons. Shows US-Japan alliance strength (technology sharing) and Japan's indigenous capabilities. Active as of 2025 with decades more service - will defend Japan well into 2040s-2050s. Evolution continues: Atago (2007) → Maya (2020, even more capable). Continuous improvement, world-class capability, peaceful defensive mission. Modern Japan: From 1945 defeat → 2007 Atago Aegis destroyer = Complete transformation.
