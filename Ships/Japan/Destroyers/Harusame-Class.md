**Tsushima Veterans** - Harusame-class were pre-WWI Japanese destroyers. 4 ships commissioned 1903-1905. Small (375 tons), coal-fired, 31 knots. Two 3-inch guns + four 18-inch torpedoes. All four fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) including Battle of Tsushima. All four scrapped 1923-1924 after 20 years service. None survived to WWII. Represented pre-WWI Japanese destroyer standard before modern developments.

**Key Specs:** 375/450 tons | 227ft | 31 kn | 2× 76mm + 4× 450mm torpedoes | Coal reciprocating | 4 ships

**Innovation:** Pre-Russo-Japanese War destroyer design (1903-1905). Small (375 tons - similar to contemporaries). Coal-fired reciprocating engines. 31 knots (standard for era). Two 3-inch guns. Four 18-inch torpedoes. All four commissioned just before or during Russo-Japanese War. All four fought Battle of Tsushima (May 1905) - Japan's decisive naval victory. All four survived war, scrapped 1923-1924 (20-21 years service). Showed Japanese destroyer effectiveness in major fleet action. Last generation before turbine-powered boats.

**Design:** Small destroyer hull (227 ft, 375 tons). Two single 3-inch guns (fore and aft). Four 18-inch torpedo tubes (two twin mounts amidships). No AA guns (concept didn't exist). Coal-fired reciprocating engines (vertical triple expansion). Two shafts. 31 knots. Limited range (1,500 nm - coastal operations). Unarmored. Crew 60. Standard pre-WWI construction - riveted, basic systems, Victorian technology evolving toward modern.

**Ships (4 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1923-1924:**
1. **Harusame** - Commissioned June 19, 1903, scrapped 1924
2. **Murasame** - Commissioned October 15, 1903, scrapped 1923
3. **Samidare** - Commissioned November 13, 1905, scrapped 1923
4. **Yudachi** - Commissioned January 8, 1905, scrapped 1923 (not same as later WWII Shiratsuyu-class Yudachi)

**Construction:**
- Builders: Japanese yards (domestic construction)
- Laid down: 1902-1904
- Commissioned: 1903-1905
- Pre/during Russo-Japanese War

**Service History:**

**Pre-Russo War (1903-1904):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- Work-up for expected war
- Harusame and Murasame commissioned before war started

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
*All Four Participated*

**Early War (1904):**
- Port Arthur blockade
- Patrol duties
- Torpedo boat defense
- Fleet screening

**Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905):**
*Decisive Naval Battle*

**Background:**
- Russian Baltic Fleet sailed around world to relieve Port Arthur
- Japanese Combined Fleet intercepted in Tsushima Strait
- Decisive battle of the war

**All Four Harusame-Class Present:**
- Part of destroyer flotilla
- Torpedo attacks on Russian ships
- Fleet screening
- Rescue operations
- **Japanese victory complete** - Russian fleet destroyed
- All four Harusame-class survived

**Destroyer Actions:**
- Night torpedo attacks
- Day torpedo runs
- Screening battleships
- Scouting
- Finishing damaged Russian ships

**Post-War (1905-1924):**

**1905-1915:**
- Training ships
- Fleet exercises
- China station patrols
- Already being surpassed by larger destroyers

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Reserve fleet
- Limited service (too small, too old)
- Training duties
- Pacific quiet anyway

**1919-1924:**
- Reserve status only
- Completely obsolete
- **All four scrapped 1923-1924**
- 20-21 years service

**Battle of Tsushima - Destroyer Role:**

**Importance:**
- Battleships won gun duel
- **Destroyers finished off damaged ships**
- Torpedo attacks disrupted Russian formation
- Night attacks prevented Russian escape
- Critical supporting role

**Harusame-Class Contribution:**
- Four small boats vs Russian fleet
- Successful torpedo attacks
- No losses (all four survived)
- Part of historic victory

**Why All Scrapped 1923-1924:**

**Obsolescence:**
1. **Age:** 18-21 years old
2. **Size:** 375 tons (modern destroyers 1,000-2,000 tons)
3. **Technology:** Coal reciprocating (modern: oil turbines)
4. **Speed:** 31 knots (modern: 35-38 knots)
5. **No value:** Too primitive even for training

**Treaty Era:**
- Washington Naval Treaty focus on capital ships
- But Japan also modernizing destroyer force
- Scrapping old ships for new construction

**Comparison - Russo-Japanese War Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Commissioned | Tsushima | Service Years | Fate |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------|---------------|------|
| **Harusame** | **4** | **1903-05** | **All 4** | **20-21** | **Scrapped 1920s** |
| Murakumo | 6 | 1900-01 | All 6 | 20-22 | Scrapped 1920s |
| Hatsu | 6 | 1905-06 | Some | 19-20 | Scrapped 1920s |

**Harusame: Middle generation, all Tsushima veterans**

**Name Reuse:**

**Yudachi:**
- Original: Harusame-class (1905-1923)
- Later: Shiratsuyu-class (1937-1942)
- WWII Yudachi famous for:
  - Third Battle of Savo Island (November 1942)
  - "Nightmare of Solomon" (aggressive night attack)
  - Sank or damaged multiple US ships
  - Sunk November 13, 1942

**Original Yudachi:** Tsushima veteran, forgotten
**Later Yudachi:** WWII "Nightmare," remembered

**Legacy:** Harusame-class represented pre-WWI Japanese destroyer standard. Four ships (1903-1905) commissioned just before/during Russo-Japanese War. All four fought Battle of Tsushima (May 1905) - Japan's decisive victory over Russia. Small (375 tons), coal-fired, 31 knots - Victorian technology. All four scrapped 1923-1924 after 20 years service. None survived to WWII. Tsushima veterans that witnessed Japan's emergence as naval power. Name Yudachi later reused for famous WWII destroyer. Names: Rain types (Harusame=Spring Rain, Murasame=Autumn Rain, Samidare=May Rain, Yudachi=Evening Rain).

**Historical Significance:** Harusame-class were Tsushima veterans - all four fought Japan's most decisive naval battle (May 27-28, 1905). Battle where Japan destroyed Russian Baltic Fleet, first time Asian power defeated European power at sea. Four small coal-fired destroyers (375 tons) vs Russian battleships - contributed torpedo attacks, screening, finishing damaged ships. All survived battle. Victory established Japan as naval power. Scrapped 1923-1924 when technology surpassed them. Evolution: Harusame (1903, 375 tons, coal, Tsushima veteran) → 25 years later → Fubuki (1928, 1,980 tons, oil, revolutionary world's best). Harusame: Honored veterans. Fubuki: Future realized. Both served Japan's naval ambitions in their time. Name Yudachi reused for WWII destroyer - original ship's Tsushima service earned that honor.
