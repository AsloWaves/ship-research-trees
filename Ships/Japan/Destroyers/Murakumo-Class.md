**Turn of Century Destroyers** - Murakumo-class were early Japanese destroyers from 1900. 6 ships commissioned 1900-1901. Tiny (336 tons), coal-fired reciprocating engines, 31 knots. Two 3-inch guns + four 18-inch torpedoes. All six fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) - Japan's victory over Russia. All six scrapped 1921-1923 after 20+ years service. None survived to WWII. Represented turn-of-century destroyer technology before modern developments.

**Key Specs:** 336/395 tons | 210ft | 31 kn | 2× 76mm + 4× 450mm torpedoes | Coal reciprocating | 6 ships

**Innovation:** Turn-of-century Japanese destroyer design (1900-1901). Small (336 tons - torpedo boat size). Coal-fired reciprocating engines. 31 knots (fast for 1900). Two 3-inch guns. Four 18-inch torpedoes (two twin mounts). All six commissioned before Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). All six participated in war - Japan's victory established naval dominance over Russia. All six scrapped 1921-1923 (20-22 years service). Victorian-era technology - before dreadnoughts, before turbines, before oil. Showed Japanese destroyer development continuity from 1890s to modern era.

**Design:** Very small hull (210 ft, 336 tons). Two single 3-inch guns (fore and aft). Four 18-inch torpedo tubes (two twin mounts amidships). No AA guns. Coal-fired reciprocating steam engines. Two shafts. 31 knots. Limited range (1,400 nm). Unarmored. Crew 55. Basic construction - riveted, Victorian technology. Designed for torpedo attack and torpedo boat defense - original destroyer mission.

**Ships (6 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1921-1923:**
1. **Murakumo** - Commissioned 1900, scrapped 1921
2. **Shiranui** - Commissioned 1901, scrapped 1921
3. **Kagero** - Commissioned 1900, scrapped 1923 (not same as later WWII Kagero-class)
4. **Usugumo** - Commissioned 1901, scrapped 1923
5. **Shirakumo** - Commissioned 1901, scrapped 1923
6. **Asashio** - Commissioned 1901, scrapped 1923 (not same as later WWII Asashio-class)

**Construction:**
- Builders: Japanese yards (domestic construction)
- Laid down: 1899-1900
- Commissioned: 1900-1901
- Pre-Russo-Japanese War program

**Service History:**

**Pre-Russo War (1900-1904):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- Torpedo tactics development
- Preparing for expected war with Russia

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
*All Six Participated*

**Background:**
- War with Russia (European great power)
- Naval superiority decisive
- Destroyers crucial for torpedo attacks and fleet screening

**Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905):**
- **Decisive naval battle** - Japan destroyed Russian Baltic Fleet
- **All six Murakumo-class present**
- Destroyer attacks on Russian ships
- Fleet screening duties
- **Japanese victory complete**
- Russia sued for peace

**Destroyer Role:**
- Torpedo attacks (night and day)
- Screening battlefleet
- Scouting
- Rescue survivors
- All six survived war

**Post-War (1905-1923):**

**1905-1915:**
- Training ships
- Fleet exercises
- China station patrols
- Already becoming obsolete (larger destroyers building)

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Reserve fleet
- Limited service
- Too small for combat
- Training duties

**1919-1923:**
- Reserve only
- Completely obsolete
- **All six scrapped 1921-1923**
- 20-22 years service (good for era)

**Russo-Japanese War Significance:**

**Naval Victory:**
- First time Asian power defeated European power at sea
- Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905)
- Russian Baltic Fleet destroyed
- **Murakumo-class: Veterans of this historic victory**

**Destroyer Lessons:**
- Torpedo attacks effective
- Fleet screening crucial
- Speed and maneuverability important
- Influenced future Japanese destroyer development

**Why 31 Knots (Fast for 1900):**

**Technology:**
- Reciprocating engines optimized
- Light hull (336 tons)
- Coal-fired but efficient
- Speed priority for torpedo attacks

**Compare:**
- Battleships 1900: 18 knots
- Cruisers 1900: 20-23 knots
- **Murakumo: 31 knots** (significantly faster)

**Speed Purpose:**
- Catch torpedo boats
- Escape battleship fire
- Position for torpedo attacks
- Retreat after attack

**Comparison - Russo-Japanese War Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | Speed | Fate |
|-------|-------|------|------|-------|------|
| **Murakumo** | **6** | **1900-01** | **336** | **31 kn** | **All scrapped 1920s** |
| Shinonome | 4 | 1905 | 360 | 29 kn | All scrapped 1920s |
| Hatsu | 6 | 1905-06 | 375 | 29 kn | All scrapped 1920s |

**Murakumo: Oldest, smallest, fastest of Russo-Japanese War destroyers**

**20-Year Service Life:**

**Typical for Era:**
- Pre-WWI destroyers: 15-25 years normal
- **Murakumo-class: 20-22 years**
- Natural end of service life
- Technology evolved beyond them

**Scrapping Timeline:**
- Murakumo, Shiranui: 1921 (21 years service)
- Others: 1923 (22-23 years service)
- Earlier scrapped ships in worse condition

**Name Reuse:**

**Two Names Later Reused for Famous WWII Destroyers:**

**Kagero:**
- Original: Murakumo-class (1900-1923)
- Later: Kagero-class lead ship (1939-1943, sunk off Rabaul)

**Asashio:**
- Original: Murakumo-class (1901-1923)
- Later: Asashio-class lead ship (1937-1943, sunk off Rabaul)

**Names honored by reuse for more successful classes**

**Legacy:** Murakumo-class represented turn-of-century Japanese destroyers. Six ships (1900-1901) - late Victorian technology. 336 tons, 31 knots, coal-fired. All six fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) - veterans of Japan's historic naval victory over Russia at Tsushima. All six scrapped 1921-1923 after 20+ years service. None survived to WWII. Founded destroyer tradition. Names Kagero and Asashio later reused for famous WWII destroyer classes. Original Murakumo-class: Forgotten Tsushima veterans. Later classes with those names: Remembered for WWII service.

**Historical Significance:** Murakumo-class witnessed Japan's emergence as naval power. Commissioned 1900-1901 during Meiji era modernization. All six fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) - Battle of Tsushima marked first time Asian navy defeated European power. Destroyers' torpedo attacks contributed to Russian fleet destruction. Scrapped 1921-1923 when technology moved beyond them. Evolution visible: Murakumo (1900, 336 tons, coal, 31 knots, reciprocating engines) → Fubuki (1928, 1,980 tons, oil, 38 knots, turbines) = 6× larger, revolutionary design in 28 years. Murakumo: Humble Victorian boats. Fubuki: World-class destroyers. Both served Japan well in their eras. Names Kagero and Asashio reused for WWII classes - original ships earned name honors through Tsushima service.
