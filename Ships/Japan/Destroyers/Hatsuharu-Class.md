**Problem Children** - Hatsuharu-class were destroyers plagued by severe topweight problems. 6 ships built 1933-1935. Originally had six 5-inch guns + nine 24-inch torpedoes - too heavy, dangerously unstable. After "Fourth Fleet Incident" (1935 typhoon capsizing), all 6 extensively modified to improve stability. Reduced armament to five guns + six torpedoes. All 6 lost in combat 1942-1943. Design lessons influenced subsequent classes.

**Key Specs:** 1,530/1,802 tons | 348ft | 36.5 kn | 5× 127mm + 6× 610mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 6 ships

**Innovation:** First IJN destroyers with severe topweight crisis. Originally designed with maximum armament (6 guns + 9 torpedoes). Proved dangerously unstable - rolled heavily, capsized in storms. "Fourth Fleet Incident" (September 1935) - several destroyers capsized or severely damaged in typhoon, including Hatsuharu-class. All 6 rebuilt 1935-1937: reduced guns (6→5), reduced torpedoes (9→6), ballast added, structure lightened. Lessons learned influenced Shiratsuyu and all subsequent designs. Showed limits of cramming weapons onto small hulls.

**Design (Original 1933):**
- Six single 5-inch guns (three forward, three aft)
- Nine 24-inch torpedoes (three triple launchers)
- High speed (36.5 knots)
- Too much topweight - dangerously unstable
- Rolled heavily in moderate seas
- Structural weaknesses discovered

**Design (After 1935-1937 Modifications):**
- Five single 5-inch guns (one removed)
- Six 24-inch torpedoes (one launcher removed)
- Ballast added (increased displacement)
- Superstructure lightened
- Bridge lowered and strengthened
- Better stability but still issues
- Reduced capability but safer

**Ships (6 built - all lost):**
1. **Hatsuharu** - Sunk November 13, 1944 (air attack, Manila Bay)
2. **Nenohi** - Sunk July 4, 1942 (submarine USS Triton)
3. **Wakaba** - Sunk October 24, 1944 (submarine USS Hawkbill)
4. **Hatsushimo** - Sunk July 30, 1945 (mine, near Maizuru) - last destroyer lost
5. **Ariake** - Sunk July 7, 1943 (surface action, Kula Gulf)
6. **Yugure** - Sunk July 20, 1943 (air attack, Bougainville)

**Construction:**
- Builders: Maizuru, Uraga, Sasebo
- Laid down: 1931-1932
- Commissioned: 1933-1935

**Fourth Fleet Incident (September 26, 1935):**
*Disaster that changed IJN destroyer design*

**Background:**
- Fourth Fleet conducting exercises off Sanriku coast
- Typhoon struck fleet
- Multiple destroyers caught in 40-50 foot waves

**The Disaster:**
- Hatsuharu-class and Fubuki-class affected
- Several destroyers capsized or nearly capsized
- Bows torn off some ships
- Bridges collapsed
- Heavy casualties

**Hatsuharu-class Impact:**
- Rolled violently - nearly capsized
- Structural damage from waves
- Revealed topweight problems
- All six ships immediately recalled

**Result:**
- Major modifications ordered for all 6 ships
- Armament reduced (6→5 guns, 9→6 torpedoes)
- 700 tons ballast added
- Superstructure lightened
- Design bureau reorganized
- All subsequent destroyer designs addressed stability
- End of arms race mentality (max guns regardless of safety)

**Major Battles:**

**Battle of Kula Gulf (July 5-6, 1943) - Ariake:**
- Tokyo Express mission
- Night action against US cruisers/destroyers
- Ariake hit by gunfire from USS Helena and others
- Dead in water, burning
- **July 7, 1943:** Scuttled after damage proved fatal
- 56 killed

**Guadalcanal/Solomons (1942-1943):**
- Multiple Hatsuharu-class participated in Tokyo Express runs
- Nenohi sunk by submarine near New Georgia
- Yugure sunk by air attack off Bougainville

**Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944) - Wakaba:**
- Part of escort force
- **October 24, 1944:** Torpedoed by USS Hawkbill
- Sank quickly
- Heavy casualties

**November 1944 - Hatsuharu:**
- At Manila Bay
- **November 13, 1944:** Attacked by US carrier aircraft
- Hit by bombs and rockets
- Sank in harbor

**July 1945 - Hatsushimo:**
*Last IJN destroyer lost*
- Transiting near Maizuru, Japan
- **July 30, 1945:** Hit mine
- Sank rapidly
- **Last Japanese destroyer lost in WWII** (only days before surrender)

**Loss Statistics:**
- **6 built, 6 lost (100% loss rate)**
- **Causes:**
  - Air attack: 2 ships (33%)
  - Submarine: 2 ships (33%)
  - Surface action: 1 ship (17%)
  - Mine: 1 ship (17%)
- **Loss period:** July 1942 - July 1945 (36 months)

**Why Topweight Crisis:**
1. **Arms race:** Tried to match larger destroyers' firepower on smaller hull
2. **6 guns + 9 torpedoes:** Too much weight high on ship
3. **Light hull:** 1,530 tons insufficient for armament
4. **Center of gravity:** Too high - unstable
5. **Poor testing:** Launched before stability trials adequate
6. **Competitive pressure:** Rush to maintain parity with Western navies

**Modifications (1935-1937):**
**Removed:**
- 1× 5-inch gun (6→5)
- 1× triple torpedo launcher (9→6 torpedoes)
- Some superstructure

**Added:**
- 700 tons ballast
- Reinforced structure
- Improved watertight integrity

**Result:**
- Better stability (still not ideal)
- Reduced combat capability
- Safer in heavy seas
- Precedent for subsequent designs

**127mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Fubuki, Shiratsuyu, Kagero classes
- **Maximum range:** 18,400 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 10-14 rounds per minute

**Comparison - Design Evolution:**
| Feature | Fubuki (1928) | Hatsuharu (1933) | Shiratsuyu (1936) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Displacement | 2,090 tons | 1,530 tons | 1,712 tons |
| Main guns | 6× 5" | 5× 5" (modified) | 5× 5" |
| Torpedoes | 9× 24" | 6× 24" (modified) | 8× 24" |
| Stability | Good | Poor→Fair | Good |

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Tokyo Express:** Guadalcanal supply runs
- **Convoy escort:** Merchant ship protection
- **ASW patrols:** Submarine hunting
- **Surface combat:** Night actions (less common due to reduced firepower)

**Hatsushimo's Significance:**
- Survived until July 30, 1945
- Longest-serving Hatsuharu-class
- **Last IJN destroyer lost in WWII**
- Sunk by mine only 16 days before surrender
- Symbolic end - survived combat only to hit mine near home

**Design Lessons Learned:**
1. **Stability critical:** Cannot sacrifice for armament
2. **Proper testing:** Extensive trials before production
3. **Realistic limits:** Cannot fit battleship firepower on destroyer hull
4. **Safety margins:** Need reserve stability for heavy weather
5. **Influenced all subsequent designs:** Shiratsuyu, Asashio, Kagero all designed with stability priority

**Legacy:** Hatsuharu-class taught IJN painful lessons about topweight and stability. Fourth Fleet Incident (1935) forced recognition that maximum armament wasn't worth capsizing. All 6 ships rebuilt with reduced armament. Despite modifications, all 6 lost in combat (100% loss rate). Hatsushimo distinction - last IJN destroyer lost (July 30, 1945). Design failures influenced all subsequent destroyers - stability became priority. Represented hubris of 1930s arms race - tried to cram too much on too little. Names: Early spring phenomena (first spring day, young leaves, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Hatsuharu-class epitomized IJN's dangerous obsession with firepower over safety. Originally designed with 6 guns + 9 torpedoes on 1,530-ton hull - recipe for disaster. Fourth Fleet Incident (1935) near-capsizing forced reality check. All 6 rebuilt with reduced armament. But damage done - wasted resources, reduced capability, delayed service. All 6 lost in combat despite modifications. Hatsushimo's loss July 30, 1945 (last destroyer) tragically fitting - class that taught expensive lessons suffered to very end. Design failures accelerated development of better-balanced Shiratsuyu and Asashio classes. Showed that arms race mentality could be literally capsizing.
