**Peak Destroyers** - Kagero-class were peak of IJN Special Type destroyer development. 18 ships built 1939-1941. Six 5-inch guns + eight 24-inch torpedoes. High speed (35.5 knots). Most successful IJN destroyer class. All but Yukikaze sunk 1942-1944. Yukikaze survived entire war undamaged - "miracle ship."

**Key Specs:** 2,033/2,490 tons | 388ft | 35.5 kn | 6× 127mm + 8× 610mm Type 93 torpedoes + 4-28× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 18 ships

**Innovation:** Refined Special Type destroyer design - balanced firepower, speed, seakeeping, and range. Improved upon Asashio-class with better hull form. Six 5-inch guns in three twin turrets (increased firepower). Eight 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes (deadly). High speed (35.5 knots) for fleet operations. Good range (5,000 nm). Represented peak of IJN destroyer design before wartime simplification. Kagero-class saw action in every major Pacific campaign.

**Design:** Three twin 5-inch turrets (two forward superfiring, one aft). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers amidships. Improved hull form for better seakeeping. High speed (35.5 knots). Good range for extended operations. Light AA armament (increased during war). Depth charges for ASW. Unarmored for speed. Excellent night-fighting capability. Type 93 oxygen torpedoes - most powerful destroyer torpedoes in WWII.

**Comparison - IJN Destroyer Classes:**
| Class | Ships | Commissioned | Tonnage | Guns | Torpedoes | Survived |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| Fubuki | 24 | 1928-1932 | 2,090 | 6× 5" | 9× 24" | 1 |
| **Kagero** | **18** | **1939-1941** | **2,033** | **6× 5"** | **8× 24"** | **1** |
| Yugumo | 19 | 1941-1943 | 2,077 | 6× 5" | 8× 24" | 1 |

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Fleet screening:** High speed, powerful torpedoes for fleet defense
- **Night actions:** Superior night optics, torpedo tactics
- **Tokyo Express:** Fast troop/supply transport
- **Carrier escort:** AA defense (limited), plane guard
- **Surface combat:** Torpedo attacks against larger ships

**Wartime Modifications:**
- **AA armament increased:** From 4× to 28+ 25mm guns
- **Radar added:** Type 22 surface search, Type 13 air search
- **Depth charges increased:** From 18 to 36
- **Weight issues:** Topweight from AA guns affected stability
- **Some ships:** Removed one 5-inch turret to reduce weight

**Legacy:** Kagero-class represented peak of IJN destroyer design - balanced firepower, speed, and seakeeping. Most successful class with 18 ships built. Participated in every major Pacific campaign. Heavy attrition (94% loss rate) showed vulnerability of destroyers in WWII. Yukikaze became legend as "miracle ship" - only Kagero to survive war undamaged. Type 93 torpedoes gave Kageros tactical advantage in night actions. Design refined by Yugumo-class but essentially similar. Tokyo Express operations showed versatility - combat, transport, evacuation. Names: All natural phenomena (winds, clouds, storms) - traditional IJN destroyer naming.

**Historical Significance:** Kagero-class epitomized IJN destroyer doctrine - fast, heavily armed, aggressive night-fighting specialists. Combat record extensive - sank multiple Allied cruisers and destroyers with torpedo attacks. Battle of Tassafaronga showed effectiveness - sank US cruiser despite being outgunned. Bismarck Sea disaster (3 ships lost one day) showed vulnerability to air attack. Yukikaze's survival became legendary - participated in Yamato's suicide mission and survived while battleship sank. High loss rate (94%) demonstrated changing nature of naval warfare - destroyers vulnerable to submarines and aircraft. Last major IJN destroyer class before wartime simplification.
