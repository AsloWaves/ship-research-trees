**Too Late to Matter** - Shimane-Maru was Japan's last escort carrier conversion. 1 ship commissioned February 1945. Converted from merchant ship 1944-1945. 24 aircraft capacity but never embarked aircraft (none available). Used only as transport - original role impossible by 1945. 19 knots. Survived war, scrapped 1947. Showed Japan's late-war futility - escort carrier commissioned when no aircraft, no pilots, no missions possible. Last desperate conversion that changed nothing.

**Key Specs:** 11,800/14,050 tons | 538ft | 19 kn | 24 aircraft (never embarked) | 8× 127mm DP + 24× 25mm AA | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Last Japanese escort carrier conversion from merchant ship. Construction 1944-1945 during desperate carrier shortage after Philippine Sea losses. Diesel engines (unusual - most carriers steam turbines). 24 aircraft capacity planned. But commissioned February 1945 when Japan had no aircraft to spare, no trained pilots, no fuel for operations. Never embarked aircraft - used solely as transport ship (troops, supplies). Survived to surrender August 1945. Scrapped 1947. Represented futility of late-war conversions - escort carrier without aircraft = expensive transport. Too little, too late.

**Design:** Merchant ship hull converted to escort carrier. Full-length flight deck (538 ft). Single hangar below. Island starboard. Two elevators. Diesel engines (8,500 shp - slow, only 19 knots). Eight 5-inch DP guns. Twenty-four 25mm AA guns. Unarmored conversion. 24 aircraft capacity (theoretical). Crew 850. Basic conversion - minimal modifications from merchant ship. Built for economy and speed of construction, not combat capability. Adequate for convoy escort (intended role) but never fulfilled that role.

**Ship:**
- **Shimane-Maru** (originally merchant ship) - **SURVIVED WAR**, scrapped 1947

**Construction:**
- **Original ship:** Merchant vessel built 1944
- **Conversion begun:** Late 1944
- **Conversion completed:** February 1945
- **Commissioned:** February 15, 1945
- **Builder:** Japanese shipyard (converted)

**Service History:**

**February 1945: Commission:**
- Commissioned February 15, 1945
- Already too late
- **Problem:** No aircraft available
- **Problem:** No trained pilots
- **Problem:** No fuel for air operations
- **Problem:** Allied air dominance total
- **Result:** Never operated as carrier

**February - August 1945: Transport Duty:**
- **Primary mission:** Troop transport
- **Secondary mission:** Supply transport
- Carried soldiers/civilians between islands
- Evacuations from losing battles
- Food/ammunition to isolated garrisons
- **Never embarked aircraft** (not one plane)
- Expensive transport ship (carrier conversion wasted)

**Why Never Operated as Carrier:**

**No Aircraft:**
1. **Losses:** Carriers lost at Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf
2. **Production:** Aircraft production collapsing (B-29 bombing)
3. **Priority:** Remaining aircraft for kamikaze (one-way missions)
4. **Training:** No replacement aircraft for carrier training
5. **Fuel:** No fuel to spare for carrier air group

**No Pilots:**
1. **Casualties:** Experienced pilots dead (1942-1944 attrition)
2. **Training:** Training program collapsed
3. **Kamikaze:** Remaining pilots assigned to kamikaze units
4. **Skill:** New pilots couldn't do carrier landings
5. **No point:** No aircraft to fly anyway

**No Missions:**
1. **Allied dominance:** US Navy ruled Pacific
2. **Range:** Japan's carriers couldn't reach enemies safely
3. **Defense:** Better to keep carriers in port (preserve hulls)
4. **Futility:** Carrier sortie = certain loss
5. **Transport needed:** Ships needed for evacuation

**August 1945: Surrender:**
- Surrendered at port
- Intact (never in combat)
- No damage
- Used for repatriation 1945-1947

**Post-War Service (1945-1947):**

**Repatriation Duty:**
- August 1945-1947: Transport Japanese from:
  - Korea
  - Manchuria
  - China
  - Southeast Asia
  - Pacific islands
- Operated under Allied supervision
- Unarmed (weapons removed)
- Carried thousands of civilians and military
- Continued original mission (transport)

**Scrapping (1947):**
- Broken up as war reparations
- Never served as operational carrier
- 2 years service (1945-1947)
- Zero carrier operations
- Entire service as transport

**Comparison - Late War Escort Carriers:**
| Carrier | Commissioned | Aircraft | Combat Service | Fate |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|------|
| **Shimane-Maru** | **Feb 1945** | **0 (never embarked)** | **None** | **Survived** |
| Kaiyo | Nov 1943 | 24 | Training/transport | Survived |
| Shinyo | Dec 1943 | 33 | Sunk Nov 1944 | Sunk |
| Taiyo | Sep 1941 | 27 | Sunk Aug 1944 | Sunk |

**Shimane-Maru: Never operational as carrier**

**Why Conversion Attempted Despite Futility:**

**Japan's Perspective (late 1944):**
1. **Carrier shortage:** Acute after Philippine Sea
2. **Hope:** War might continue years
3. **Desperation:** Any carrier better than none
4. **Resources:** Merchant ship available
5. **Quick:** Conversion faster than new build

**Reality (1945):**
1. **War ending:** Months not years
2. **No aircraft:** Production collapsing
3. **No fuel:** Oil imports cut off
4. **No pilots:** Training impossible
5. **Futility:** Carrier without aircraft useless

**Diesel Engines:**

**Unusual for Carrier:**
- Most carriers: Steam turbines (high speed)
- Shimane-Maru: Diesel (merchant ship engines)
- **Speed penalty:** 19 knots (slow for carrier)
- **Advantage:** Good range (8,000 nm)
- **Advantage:** Fuel efficient

**Why Diesel:**
- Original merchant ship had diesel
- Conversion kept original engines (cheaper/faster)
- Speed not priority (late war - any carrier needed)
- Range valuable (distant operations)

**Result:**
- Too slow for fleet operations (fleet 25+ knots)
- Adequate for convoy escort (intended role)
- Never tested (no operations)

**Legacy:** Shimane-Maru represented Japanese late-war desperation. Last escort carrier conversion commissioned February 1945. Never embarked aircraft - none available. Never operated as carrier - impossible by 1945. Used only as transport (expensive way to move troops). Survived war, scrapped 1947. Showed futility of late conversions - escort carrier without aircraft = wasted effort. Japan converting merchant ships to carriers while having no aircraft/pilots/fuel for operations. Strategic bankruptcy visible. 2 years service (1945-1947), zero carrier operations, entire service as transport. Name: Shimane-Maru (merchant ship name retained).

**Historical Significance:** Shimane-Maru epitomized Japan's late-war industrial futility. Commissioned February 15, 1945 - six months before surrender. Escort carrier that never carried aircraft. Japan had no aircraft to give (production collapsed), no pilots to fly them (all dead or kamikaze-assigned), no fuel to operate (oil imports cut off), no missions possible (Allied dominance total). Expensive conversion wasted - better to keep as merchant ship. But Japan kept converting ships to carriers while having nothing to put on them - strategic delusion. Survived war, served 1945-1947 as transport (original merchant role). Shows difference between desperation and strategy. Compare to US: Built 122 escort carriers 1941-1945, all operational, all with aircraft. Japan: Built/converted ~15 escort carriers, most sunk, last ones (Shimane-Maru, late Kaiyos) never operational. Industrial capacity gap insurmountable by 1945.
