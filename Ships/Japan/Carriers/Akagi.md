**Pearl Harbor Flagship** - Akagi was flagship of Kido Butai (carrier striking force) at Pearl Harbor. Converted from battlecruiser (Amagi-class). 855 ft, 66-91 aircraft. Led six carrier attack force December 7, 1941. Sunk at Battle of Midway June 4, 1942.

**Key Specs:** 36,500/42,750 tons | 855ft | 31 kn | 66-91 aircraft | 6× 200mm + 12× 120mm DP | 152mm belt machinery | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Converted from Amagi-class battlecruiser after Washington Naval Treaty (1922). Originally had three-tier flight deck (unique design), reduced to single deck 1938 modernization. Became one of IJN's most important carriers. Led Kido Butai as Admiral Nagumo's flagship. Symbol of IJN carrier power.

**Design:** Full-length flight deck (855 ft). Island on port side (unusual - most carriers starboard). Two hangar decks. Large air group. Originally three flight decks (upper for landing, two for takeoff), rebuilt 1935-1938 to single full-length deck. Eight-inch guns initially for surface action, removed in modernization. Good speed (31 knots) for fast carrier operations.

**Conversion History:**
- Originally laid down as Amagi-class battlecruiser (May 6, 1920)
- Work suspended by Washington Naval Treaty (1922)
- Converted to aircraft carrier (started 1923)
- Launched April 22, 1925
- Commissioned March 25, 1927
- Major modernization 1935-1938: Removed middle flight deck, island moved, armor added, speed increased

**Service:**
- **1927-1941:** Training and operations, China operations (1937-1938)
- **December 7, 1941:** Pearl Harbor attack - Kido Butai flagship, launched 57 aircraft (first wave)
- **January-February 1942:** Rabaul-Ambon operations
- **February-March 1942:** Darwin raid (Australia), Java Sea operations
- **April 1942:** Indian Ocean raid - attacked Colombo (Ceylon)
- **June 4, 1942:** **Battle of Midway** - sunk

**Battle of Midway (June 4, 1942):**
- Part of four-carrier strike force (Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, Soryu)
- Launched attack on Midway Island (morning)
- **10:22 AM:** Hit by three bombs from SBD Dauntless dive bombers (USS Enterprise VB-6)
- Bombs struck hangar decks with armed/fueled aircraft preparing for second wave
- Massive fires and explosions, uncontrollable
- Abandoned at 4:55 PM
- Admiral Nagumo transferred flag to cruiser Nagara
- Scuttled by IJN destroyers early June 5, 1942 (4 torpedoes)
- Sank 5:00 AM June 5, 1942
- 267 killed (1,733 survivors)

**Aircraft Complement (December 1941):**
- 21× A6M2 Zero fighters (air superiority, escort)
- 21× D3A1 Val dive bombers (precision attack)
- 21× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers (torpedo/level bombing)
- 6× spare/reserve aircraft
- **Total:** 69 operational aircraft

**Pearl Harbor Attack:**
- **First Wave (Akagi contribution):** 27 aircraft
  - 9× B5N Kate level bombers (high-altitude bombing)
  - 9× A6M Zero fighters (fighter escort/strafe)
  - 9× D3A Val dive bombers (dive bombing)
- Attacked battleship row, airfields
- Achieved complete surprise
- Returned to Akagi by 10:00 AM

**Notable Actions:**
- **Pearl Harbor:** Flagship for most successful carrier attack in history
- **Darwin (February 19, 1942):** 54 aircraft from Akagi attacked Darwin, Australia
- **Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942):** Attacked Colombo with 91 aircraft
- **Midway:** Flagship for catastrophic IJN defeat

**Wreck Discovery:**
- Located October 20, 2019 by R/V Petrel
- Depth: 5,490 meters (18,011 feet)
- Located 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor
- Wreck sitting upright, largely intact despite scuttling

**Legacy:** Symbol of IJN carrier power. Led attack on Pearl Harbor - iconic moment in naval history. Midway sinking was turning point of Pacific War. Loss of Akagi (and three other carriers) crippled IJN carrier force. Represented Japan's mastery of carrier aviation 1941-1942. Wreck discovery (2019) brought renewed attention to Battle of Midway. Name means "Red Castle."

**Historical Significance:** Akagi's career spanned from treaty conversions (1920s) through Japan's carrier dominance (1941-1942) to catastrophic defeat (Midway). Pearl Harbor attack from Akagi demonstrated carrier aircraft could defeat battleships. Midway loss proved carriers themselves vulnerable to carrier aircraft. Embodied rise and fall of IJN carrier aviation. Admiral Nagumo's flagship for most significant operations December 1941-June 1942.
