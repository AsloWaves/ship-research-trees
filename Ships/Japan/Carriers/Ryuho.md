**The Lucky Survivor** - Ryuho was a light carrier converted from submarine tender Taigei. 1 ship commissioned November 1942. 31 aircraft, 26.5 knots. Longest conversion time (1940-1942). Used primarily for training, never engaged enemy. **Only IJN carrier to survive entire war undamaged** - luck and training role kept her from combat. Scrapped 1947. Showed value of keeping some ships out of frontline for training.

**Key Specs:** 13,360/16,700 tons | 708ft | 26.5 kn | 31 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 30-60× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Converted from submarine tender Taigei (built 1933). Originally designed for submarine support but recognized as potential carrier hull. Conversion ordered 1940, completed November 1942 (long conversion - 2 years). 31 aircraft capacity. 26.5 knots (faster than escort carriers). Used almost exclusively for training - preserved from frontline combat. **Only IJN carrier to survive war without combat damage**. Luck combination: Training role + war ending before needed in combat. Scrapped 1947. Longest-serving IJN carrier conversion.

**Design:** Converted from submarine tender. Full-length flight deck (708 ft). Single hangar. Island starboard. Two elevators. Steam turbines (26.5 knots - faster than Taiyo-class). Eight 5-inch DP guns. Heavy light AA (up to 60× 25mm by 1945). Unarmored conversion. 31 aircraft capacity - light carrier size. Good range (8,000 nm). Larger and faster than escort carriers, smaller than fleet carriers. Designed for flexibility but used for training.

**Ship:**
- **Ryuho** (originally submarine tender Taigei) - **SURVIVED WAR UNDAMAGED**, scrapped 1947

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** November 24, 1931 (as submarine tender Taigei)
- **Launched:** May 16, 1933 (as Taigei)
- **Commissioned as tender:** July 31, 1934
- **Conversion begun:** 1940
- **Commissioned as carrier:** November 28, 1942

**Original Ship - Taigei (Submarine Tender):**

**Service as Tender (1934-1940):**
- Supported submarine flotillas
- Repair, resupply, maintenance
- Mother ship for submarines
- Good design for conversion (large hull, machinery spaces)

**1940:** Conversion to carrier ordered (pre-war planning)

**Carrier Service (November 1942-August 1945):**

**1942-1943: Work-up and Initial Training:**
- Commissioned November 1942
- Training off Japan
- Aircraft handling practice
- Crew familiarization
- **Not sent to frontline** (decision saved ship)

**1943-1944: Training Carrier:**
- **Primary mission:** Train carrier pilots
- Carrier landing practice
- Takeoff and landing training
- Qualify new pilots
- Based in safer Japanese waters

**Why Used for Training:**
1. **Pilot shortage:** 1943-1944 desperate for trained pilots
2. **Protected asset:** Too valuable to risk (carriers scarce)
3. **Adequate capability:** 31 aircraft sufficient for training
4. **Good speed:** 26.5 knots adequate for training ops
5. **Strategic decision:** Preserve for training, not combat

**1944-1945: Continued Training:**
- Training intensified (kamikaze pilots included)
- Never engaged in combat
- Occasional transport missions (aircraft ferry)
- Heavy AA for self-defense (60× 25mm by 1945)
- Based near Japan (safer waters)

**August 1945: Surrender:**
- Surrendered intact at Kure
- Undamaged (only IJN carrier to achieve this)
- No combat damage entire war
- Used for repatriation 1945-1947

**Why Ryuho Survived:**

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Training role:** Kept from frontline combat
2. **Late commission:** November 1942 - after Midway, Coral Sea
3. **Strategic reserve:** Too valuable to waste
4. **Pilot training priority:** Training more important than one more frontline carrier
5. **Based in Japan:** Safer waters (though still raided late war)
6. **Luck:** War ended before forced into combat
7. **Heavy AA:** 60× 25mm guns by 1945 - good self-defense

**Avoided:**
- Battle of Philippine Sea (June 1944)
- Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944)
- Desperate kamikaze operations
- Only fleet carrier to avoid all major battles

**Post-War Service (1945-1947):**

**Repatriation Duty:**
- August 1945-1947: Transport missions
- Repatriated Japanese from:
  - Korea
  - Manchuria
  - China
  - Southeast Asia
- Operated under Allied supervision
- Unarmed (weapons removed)
- Carried thousands of civilians and military

**Scrapping (1947):**
- Broken up as war reparations
- 13 years service total (1934-1947, including tender service)
- Only IJN carrier scrapped intact (not sunk, not damaged)

**Aircraft Complement (typical training mission):**

**Training Configuration:**
- 20-25 operational aircraft:
  - A6M Zero fighters (carrier landing practice)
  - B5N Kate torpedo bombers (training)
  - Training variants
  - Mix for comprehensive training
- Emphasis on launch/recovery cycles
- Multiple sorties per day

**Comparison - IJN Carrier Survival:**
| Carrier | Type | Commissioned | Fate | Combat Damage |
|---------|------|--------------|------|---------------|
| **Ryuho** | **Light** | **Nov 1942** | **Survived** | **None** |
| Hosho | Light | 1922 | Survived | Minor (air raid) |
| Katsuragi | Fleet | 1944 | Survived | Heavy (air raid) |
| All others | Various | 1920-1944 | Sunk | N/A |

**Ryuho: Only carrier to survive undamaged**

**Why Training Role So Important:**

**1943-1944 Pilot Crisis:**
- Heavy pilot losses (Coral Sea, Midway, Solomons, Philippine Sea)
- Training program inadequate
- New pilots poorly trained
- Need for experienced training ship
- **Ryuho preserved for this critical role**

**Result:**
- Trained hundreds of pilots 1943-1945
- Many became kamikaze pilots (desperate times)
- Training platform more valuable than one more combat carrier
- Strategic decision proved correct - Ryuho survived, frontline carriers didn't

**Conversion Timeline:**
**1940:** Conversion ordered
**1940-1942:** Conversion work (2 years - long)
**November 28, 1942:** Commissioned

**Why So Long:**
- Submarine tender very different from carrier
- Extensive modifications needed
- Hull structure modified
- Flight deck framing complex
- Hangar installation difficult
- Machinery modifications
- Interrupted by war priorities

**Comparison - Tender Conversions:**
| Ship | Original | Conversion Time | Service | Fate |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------|------|
| **Ryuho** | **Taigei (tender)** | **2 years** | **Training** | **Survived** |
| Shoho | Tsurugisaki (tender) | 2 years | Combat | Sunk 1942 |
| Zuiho | Takasaki (tender) | 2 years | Combat | Sunk 1944 |

**Only tender conversion to survive**

**If Used in Combat (Hypothetical):**
**Likely Fate:**
- Would have been sent to Philippine Sea or Leyte Gulf
- Probable loss (US air superiority overwhelming)
- Would not have survived to 1945

**Actually:**
- Kept for training
- Survived war
- Strategic wisdom

**Legacy:** Ryuho achieved unique distinction - only IJN carrier to survive entire war undamaged. Converted from submarine tender Taigei (1940-1942). Commissioned November 1942. Used primarily for pilot training - strategic decision preserved her. Never engaged enemy. Heavy AA (60× 25mm by 1945) for self-defense. Survived to surrender intact (August 1945). Repatriation service 1945-1947. Scrapped 1947. Showed value of keeping some assets for training rather than throwing everything into combat. Strategic patience paid off - Ryuho lived, combat carriers died. Name: Ryuho (Dragon Phoenix) - appropriate for survivor.

**Historical Significance:** Ryuho's survival unique among IJN carriers. Only carrier to avoid all combat, survive undamaged. Strategic decision to use for training (1942-1945) preserved her. Trained hundreds of pilots during desperate shortage. Most carriers rushed to frontline, lost to US air/submarine power. Ryuho kept in Japan waters, survived. Shows strategic value of reserve/training assets. If sent to Philippine Sea or Leyte Gulf, likely sunk like all others. But training role more valuable - one carrier training hundreds of pilots vs one more frontline loss. War ended before Ryuho needed in combat. Lucky timing + strategic wisdom = only undamaged carrier survivor. Contrast with all others: Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu (Midway), Shokaku, Zuikaku (Philippine Sea/Leyte), Taiho, Shinano, etc. - all lost. Ryuho: The one that got away.
