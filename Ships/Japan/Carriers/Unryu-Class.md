**Emergency Carriers** - Unryu-class were simplified Hiryu-type carriers for mass production. 16 planned, only 3 completed 1944-1945. Based on 1939 Hiryu design (not modern Shokaku). 746 ft, 65 aircraft. Too few, too late - none saw combat. Unryu and Amagi sunk by submarines 1944-1945. Katsuragi survived as only IJN fleet carrier to survive war intact.

**Key Specs:** 17,150/22,400 tons | 746ft | 34 kn | 65 aircraft | 12× 127mm DP + 89× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 3 ships (16 planned)

**Innovation:** Emergency mass-production design. Based on Hiryu (1939) instead of modern Shokaku or Taiho - simpler, faster to build. Eliminated modern features for speed of construction. Unarmored for rapid production. Standardized components. 16 ships planned - only 3 completed due to war losses, resource shortages, labor shortages. Represented IJN desperation - quantity over quality. None achieved combat operations due to fuel, aircraft, and pilot shortages.

**Design:** Based on Hiryu (1937-1939 design). Single hangar deck. Island starboard. Two elevators. Simplified construction - straight sides, less complex structure. Unarmored (like Hiryu, not armored like Taiho). Twelve 5-inch DP guns. Heavy light AA (89× 25mm). Flight deck 746 ft. Good speed (34 knots). No enclosed bow (unlike Taiho). Standardized machinery. Focus: build fast, build many.

**Ships (3 completed of 16 planned):**
**Completed:**
1. **Unryu** - Commissioned August 6, 1944, sunk December 19, 1944 (submarine USS Redfish)
2. **Amagi** - Commissioned August 10, 1944, sunk July 24, 1945 (air raid, Kure)
3. **Katsuragi** - Commissioned October 15, 1944, survived war, scrapped 1946-1947

**Cancelled/Incomplete (13 ships):**
4. Kasagi - 84% complete, scrapped on slip
5. Aso - 60% complete, scuttled incomplete 1945
6. Ikoma - Cancelled 1945
7. through 16. - Cancelled 1943-1945, never laid down or scrapped on slips

**Construction:**
- **Unryu:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, laid down August 1, 1942, launched September 25, 1943, commissioned August 6, 1944
- **Amagi:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down October 1, 1942, launched October 15, 1943, commissioned August 10, 1944
- **Katsuragi:** Kure Naval Arsenal, laid down December 8, 1942, launched January 19, 1944, commissioned October 15, 1944

**Service:**
- **Unryu (August-December 1944):**
  - Commissioned August 6, 1944
  - Training and work-up
  - Never conducted combat operations (no aircraft embarked)
  - **December 17, 1944:** Departed Kure to ferry aircraft from Japan to Philippines
  - **December 19, 1944:** Torpedoed by USS Redfish in East China Sea
  - Three torpedo hits, sank in ~5 hours
  - 1,238 killed (including 146 passengers), only 145 survivors
  - Never embarked operational air group

- **Amagi (August 1944-July 1945):**
  - Commissioned August 10, 1944
  - Training at Kure
  - Never conducted combat operations
  - Immobilized by fuel shortages
  - Used as floating AA battery at Kure
  - **July 24, 1945:** Kure air raid - attacked by 400+ US carrier aircraft
  - Hit by multiple bombs
  - Capsized in shallow water
  - Raised 1946-1947, scrapped

- **Katsuragi (October 1944-August 1945):**
  - Commissioned October 15, 1944
  - Training, never operational
  - No aircraft embarked (pilot/aircraft shortages)
  - Immobilized at Sasebo due to fuel shortage
  - **July 28, 1945:** Bombed at Sasebo by US carrier aircraft
  - Damaged but survived
  - **August 15, 1945:** Surrendered intact
  - **Only IJN fleet carrier to survive war intact**
  - Used as repatriation transport 1945-1946
  - Scrapped 1946-1947

**Sinking of Unryu (December 19, 1944):**
- Mission: Ferry aircraft from Japan to Philippines (desperate attempt to reinforce)
- **December 19, 3:50 PM:** Spotted by USS Redfish (submarine) off Shanghai
- USS Redfish fired 4 torpedoes
- **4:09 PM:** Three torpedoes hit Unryu starboard side
- Massive flooding, fires
- **Dead in water, listing heavily**
- Destroyers attempted to take off survivors
- **8:45 PM:** Capsized and sank
- **1,238 killed, 145 survivors**
- Never embarked operational air group - empty carrier sunk on first mission

**Why Only 3 Completed:**
1. **Resource shortages:** Steel, materials prioritized for destroyers, escorts
2. **Labor shortages:** Skilled workers drafted into military
3. **Bombing:** B-29 raids disrupted shipyards
4. **Futility:** No fuel to operate, no aircraft, no pilots
5. **Priority shift:** Escorts for convoy protection more urgent
6. **War losses:** Midway and Philippine Sea made carriers less relevant

**Why None Saw Combat:**
1. **No aircraft:** Severe aircraft production shortages
2. **No pilots:** Experienced pilots dead, training program collapsed
3. **No fuel:** Oil supplies cut off by submarines
4. **Too late:** Commissioned October 1944 onward - after Philippine Sea
5. **Immobilized:** Kept in port as floating AA batteries
6. **Mission shifted:** Used for transport, not combat

**Comparison - Unryu vs Modern Carriers:**
| Feature | Unryu-class (1944) | Taiho (1944) | Shokaku (1941) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Design year | 1939 (Hiryu) | 1941 (modern) | 1937 (modern) |
| Armor | None | 7.5" flight deck | 6.6" belt |
| Displacement | 17,150 | 29,300 | 25,675 |
| Aircraft | 65 | 75 | 84 |
| Build time | ~24 months | ~36 months | ~30 months |

**Why Based on Old Design (Hiryu):**
- **Simpler:** 1939 design easier to build than 1941+ designs
- **Proven:** Hiryu design well-understood by shipyards
- **Faster:** Could build quicker than complex modern designs
- **Resources:** Required less strategic materials
- **But obsolete:** No armor, outdated layout, less capable

**Aircraft Never Embarked:**
- All three commissioned without aircraft aboard
- Pilot shortage - most experienced pilots dead
- Aircraft production insufficient
- No time for training
- Unryu sunk while trying to ferry aircraft
- Amagi and Katsuragi never received air groups

**Katsuragi - Only Survivor:**
- Commissioned October 15, 1944
- Never embarked aircraft
- Never left Japanese waters
- Immobilized at Sasebo by fuel shortage
- Bombed July 28, 1945 but survived
- Surrendered intact August 1945
- Used for repatriation transport 1945-1946
- **Only IJN fleet carrier to survive war intact**
- Scrapped 1946-1947

**Cancelled Ships:**
- **Kasagi:** 84% complete, scrapped on slip 1945
- **Aso:** 60% complete, bombed at Kure, scuttled incomplete
- **Ikoma through Ship 16:** Cancelled 1943-1945
- Most never laid down
- Those started were scrapped on slips
- Resources diverted to escorts, kamikaze boats

**Design Philosophy:**
- Quantity over quality
- Mass production over sophistication
- Simple over complex
- Fast construction over capabilities
- Based on proven design over innovation
- Emergency stopgap, not long-term solution

**Legacy:** Unryu-class epitomized IJN desperation - simplified emergency carriers based on obsolete design. Only 3 of 16 completed. None saw combat. Unryu sunk on first mission. Amagi bombed in port. Katsuragi survived but never operated. Represented futile attempt to replace Midway and Philippine Sea losses. Too few, too late, no fuel, no aircraft, no pilots. Mass production plan failed - could build ships but not operate them. Katsuragi's survival as only fleet carrier showed how completely IJN carrier power had collapsed. Names: Mountains and dragons - Unryu (Cloud Dragon), Amagi (Mount Amagi), Katsuragi (Mount Katsuragi).

**Historical Significance:** Unryu-class showed that building carriers meaningless without fuel, aircraft, and pilots. Emergency design based on 1939 technology couldn't compete with 1944 reality. Only 3 completed of 16 planned - industrial collapse. None achieved combat operations - operational collapse. Unryu sunk on first mission (empty carrier). Amagi bombed in port (floating AA battery). Katsuragi survived but useless (no aircraft, no fuel). Represented end of IJN carrier power - could no longer build or operate carriers effectively. Contrast with US: building 100+ carriers with full air groups, fuel, and pilots. Last IJN carriers built - war ended before more could be completed or operated.
