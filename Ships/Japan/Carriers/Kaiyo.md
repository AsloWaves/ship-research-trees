**The Survivor** - Kaiyo was an escort carrier converted from luxury liner Argentina Maru. 1 ship commissioned 1943. 24 aircraft, 24 knots (faster than Taiyo-class). Aircraft transport, training, and occasional combat. **Only IJN escort carrier to survive war.** Multiple close calls with submarines and air attacks. Used for repatriation 1945-1947, then scrapped 1948. Lucky ship that outlasted all other Japanese escort carriers.

**Key Specs:** 13,600/16,500 tons | 545ft | 24 kn | 24 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 24-60× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Converted from luxury liner Argentina Maru (NYK Line, built 1939). Originally passenger/cargo ship Argentina-Japan route. Conversion begun 1942, completed 1943. Faster than Taiyo-class (24 vs 21 knots) - steam turbines vs diesel. 24 aircraft capacity. Used primarily for aircraft ferry missions, training, and convoy escort. **Only Japanese escort carrier to survive war** - combination of luck, timing, and useful non-combat role. Multiple submarine attacks avoided. Survived to 1947 repatriation service.

**Design:** Converted from ocean liner. Flight deck over original hull (545 ft). Single hangar. Island starboard. Two elevators. Steam turbines (liner machinery modified). Eight 5-inch DP guns. Heavy light AA (increased to 60× 25mm by 1945). Unarmored conversion. 24 aircraft capacity - smaller than Taiyo-class but adequate. Good range (8,000 nm) from liner fuel capacity. Faster than Taiyo-class made her more survivable.

**Ship:**
- **Kaiyo** (originally Argentina Maru) - **SURVIVED WAR**, scrapped 1948

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki
- **Laid down:** 1938 (as liner Argentina Maru)
- **Launched:** September 20, 1938 (as liner)
- **Conversion begun:** 1942
- **Commissioned as carrier:** November 23, 1943

**Service History:**

**Original Ship - Argentina Maru:**
- Luxury liner NYK (Nippon Yusen Kaisha) Line
- Japan-Argentina route
- Passenger and cargo service
- 1939-1941: Commercial service
- December 1941: Seized by IJN for conversion

**Carrier Service (November 1943-August 1945):**

**1943-1944: Aircraft Ferry:**
- Primary mission: Transport aircraft to forward bases
- Philippines, Truk, Rabaul routes
- Carried crated and operational aircraft
- Avoided major combat operations
- Several close calls with submarines

**1944: Training Carrier:**
- Carrier landing training for new pilots
- By 1944, pilot training desperate priority
- Operated in relatively safe waters (Japan/Korea)
- Less exposed than combat carriers

**1945: Final Missions:**
- Continued training operations
- Limited fuel restricted operations
- Avoided major battles
- Survived submarine attacks through luck and evasion

**Close Calls:**

**Submarine Attacks (multiple incidents):**
- **1944:** Torpedoes missed (evasive action successful)
- **1945:** Detected by US submarines but escaped
- 24 knots gave speed advantage over slower escorts
- Zigzagging and luck saved ship repeatedly

**Air Attacks:**
- Several near misses from US carrier aircraft
- Heavy AA (up to 60× 25mm by 1945) provided defense
- Often operating near Japan (air cover available)

**Why Kaiyo Survived:**

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Speed:** 24 knots vs 21 knots (Taiyo-class) - could evade submarines better
2. **Role:** Aircraft ferry and training - avoided frontline combat
3. **Timing:** Commissioned November 1943 - missed early desperate battles
4. **Location:** Often near Japan - safer than forward areas
5. **Luck:** Multiple submarine attacks failed
6. **Heavy AA:** 60× 25mm guns by 1945 - good defense
7. **Valuable:** Too useful to waste in combat - preserved for transport

**Contrast with Taiyo-Class:**
- **Taiyo-class:** All 3 sunk 1943-1944 (100% loss rate, 3,253 killed)
- **Kaiyo:** Survived entire war
- **Difference:** Speed (24 vs 21 knots) and role (training/ferry vs combat escort)

**Post-War Service (1945-1947):**

**Repatriation Duty:**
- August 1945-1947: Intensive operations
- Transported Japanese personnel from:
  - Korea
  - Manchuria
  - China
  - Southeast Asia
- Operated under Allied supervision
- Weapons removed (unarmed transport)
- Carried thousands of civilians and military

**Conditions:**
- Overcrowded (carrier space limited)
- Minimal supplies
- Humanitarian mission
- Former warship now life-saver

**Scrapping (1948):**
- Repatriation mission completed
- Broken up in Japan as war reparations
- Not preserved
- Ended 10-year career (1938-1948)

**Aircraft Complement (typical):**

**Ferry Mission:**
- 30+ crated aircraft in hangar and on deck
- Minimal operational aircraft (self-defense)
- Aviation fuel and supplies
- Spare parts, munitions

**Training Mission:**
- 18-24× operational aircraft:
  - A6M Zero fighters
  - B6N Kate torpedo bombers
  - Training variants
- Mix for carrier landing practice

**Comparison - Escort Carriers Survival:**
| Ship | Nation | Commissioned | Fate | Service Length |
|------|--------|--------------|------|----------------|
| **Kaiyo** | **Japan** | **Nov 1943** | **Survived** | **1943-1947** |
| Taiyo | Japan | Sep 1941 | Sunk Aug 1944 | 34 months |
| Unyo | Japan | May 1942 | Sunk Sep 1944 | 28 months |
| Chuyo | Japan | Nov 1942 | Sunk Dec 1943 | 13 months |
| Casablanca-class | USA | 1943-44 | 45/50 survived | Most survived |

**Speed Comparison:**
| Carrier | Speed | Survival |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Kaiyo** | **24 knots** | **Survived** |
| Taiyo | 21 knots | Sunk (submarine) |
| Unyo | 21 knots | Sunk (submarine) |
| Chuyo | 21 knots | Sunk (submarine) |

**3-knot difference (24 vs 21) may have been lifesaving**

**127mm/40 Type 89 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as other Japanese carriers
- **Dual-purpose:** Anti-surface and anti-aircraft
- **Maximum range:** 14,800 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 8-14 rounds per minute
- 8 guns in four twin mounts

**Why Only One Built:**

**Original Plan:**
- More conversions planned from liners
- Argentina Maru available and suitable
- Conversion completed 1943

**Why No More:**
- **Suitable liners exhausted:** Most already converted or sunk
- **Resources scarce:** Steel, labor needed elsewhere
- **Priorities shifted:** Fleet carriers priority (Taiho, Unryu-class)
- **Late war:** Conversions took too long by 1944-1945

**Tactical Employment:**

**Primary Missions:**
1. **Aircraft ferry:** Transport planes to forward bases
2. **Training:** Carrier landing practice
3. **Transport:** Troops, supplies (occasional)
4. **Convoy escort:** Rare (too valuable to risk)

**Avoided:**
- Fleet carrier battles
- Aggressive combat operations
- Exposed positions (Truk, Rabaul after 1944)

**Result:** Preserved for useful roles, survived war

**Legacy:** Kaiyo achieved unique distinction - only Japanese escort carrier to survive WWII. Converted from luxury liner Argentina Maru (1943). Faster than Taiyo-class (24 vs 21 knots) - may have saved her. Used for aircraft ferry and training - avoided frontline combat. Multiple submarine attacks failed (luck and speed). Survived air attacks (heavy AA, good positioning). Served vital repatriation role 1945-1947. Scrapped 1948. Showed that speed, role, and luck all mattered. 3-knot advantage over Taiyo-class may explain survival while all 3 Taiyo-class lost to submarines. Name: Kaiyo (Sea Hawk) - lived up to name, soared above danger.

**Historical Significance:** Kaiyo's survival unique among Japanese escort carriers. Taiyo-class (3 ships, 21 knots) - 100% loss rate, all to submarines. Kaiyo (24 knots) - survived. Speed difference (3 knots) possibly decisive - could evade submarine attacks better. Role also critical - training and ferry missions kept her from desperate frontline operations. Commissioned November 1943 - missed early desperate battles. Multiple submarine attacks failed - combination of speed, evasion, luck. Heavy AA (60× 25mm by 1945) defended against aircraft. Post-war repatriation service showed warships could become humanitarian vessels. Only Japanese escort carrier crew to survive war intact. Proved that in WWII submarine-dominated environment, every knot of speed mattered.
