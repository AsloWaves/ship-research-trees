**Armored Tragedy** - Taiho was IJN's first armored carrier with 3.1-inch armored flight deck. Commissioned March 7, 1944. Most modern IJN carrier design. Sunk June 19, 1944 (Battle of Philippine Sea) by single submarine torpedo that caused catastrophic aviation fuel explosion. Only 3 months of service - shortest career of any major IJN carrier. 1,650 killed.

**Key Specs:** 29,300/37,270 tons | 855ft | 33 kn | 53-75 aircraft | 12× 100mm DP + 71× 25mm AA | 152mm belt, 80mm armored flight deck | 1 ship

**Innovation:** First IJN armored carrier - 3.1-inch armored flight deck, 2-inch hangar sides. Enclosed hurricane bow (improved seakeeping). British-influenced design after witnessing armored carrier resilience. Most modern IJN carrier - incorporated all lessons from 1941-1943. Advanced damage control systems (proved inadequate). Largest IJN carrier besides Shinano. Hurricane bow allowed flight operations in heavy seas. Design influenced by HMS Illustrious-class success.

**Design:** Armored flight deck (80mm) - first for IJN. Enclosed hurricane bow. Single hangar deck (armored sides). Large island structure starboard. Two elevators (centerline). Hydraulic catapult. Modern fire suppression (failed in practice). Heavy AA armament (12× 100mm DP, 71× 25mm). Radar-equipped. Good speed (33 knots). Large air group (75 aircraft capacity). Most sophisticated IJN carrier design.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Kawasaki Kobe Shipyard
- Laid down: July 10, 1941
- Launched: April 7, 1943
- Commissioned: March 7, 1944
- Cost: 140 million yen (most expensive IJN carrier)

**Service (March-June 1944):**
- **March 7, 1944:** Commissioned at Kobe
- **March-May 1944:** Training and work-up
- **May 1944:** Assigned to First Mobile Fleet flagship
- **June 11, 1944:** Departed for Philippine Sea operation
- **June 19, 1944:** **Battle of Philippine Sea** - sunk

**Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19, 1944):**
*"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot" - Taiho's first and last battle*

**Background:**
- Flagship of Vice Admiral Ozawa's Mobile Fleet
- Part of 9-carrier strike force (largest IJN carrier operation since Midway)
- Mission: Defend Marianas, destroy US Fifth Fleet

**The Fatal Torpedo (8:09 AM, June 19):**
- **USS Albacore (SS-218)** fired spread of 6 torpedoes
- One torpedo hit Taiho starboard side forward
- Struck near aviation fuel tanks and forward elevator
- Relatively minor damage initially - ship maintained speed/operations
- Elevator jammed in up position
- Aviation fuel tanks ruptured, gasoline leaked

**The Catastrophe (12:32 PM):**
- **Fatal mistake:** Damage control officer ordered ventilation system activated to disperse gasoline fumes
- Fumes spread throughout ship instead of being contained
- Gasoline vapor accumulated in hangars, passageways, machinery spaces
- **12:32 PM:** Massive explosion - ignition source unknown
- Aviation fuel vapor detonated throughout ship
- **Second explosion** (12:34 PM) - even larger
- Flight deck blown upward, buckled
- Hangar deck destroyed
- Fires erupted throughout ship
- Armor deck contained explosion energy - actually increased damage inside

**Sinking (2:28 PM):**
- Ship dead in water, listing
- Fires uncontrollable
- Magazine explosions
- **2:28 PM:** Capsized and sank
- **1,650 killed (including Admiral Kikuchi), 570 survivors**
- Admiral Ozawa transferred flag to cruiser Haguro, then to carrier Zuikaku

**Aircraft Complement (June 1944):**
- 27× A6M5 Zero fighters
- 27× D4Y1 Judy dive bombers
- 18× B6N2 Jill torpedo bombers
- **Total:** 72 aircraft (below full capacity - pilot shortage)

**The Fatal Design Flaw:**
- Armored flight deck designed to resist bombs from above
- But armor contained explosions INSIDE ship
- Aviation fuel vapor explosion had nowhere to vent
- Unarmored carriers (Lexington, Shoho, etc.) - explosions blew outward
- Taiho's armor trapped explosion energy inside hull
- Hangar deck became pressure vessel - catastrophic failure
- Irony: armor meant to protect became death trap

**Comparison - Aviation Fuel Explosions:**
| Carrier | Nation | Armored | Cause | Time to Sink | Result |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Taiho** | **Japan** | **Yes** | **Fuel vapor** | **6.5 hours** | **Contained explosion destroyed internals** |
| Lexington | USA | No | Fuel vapor | 7 hours | Explosions blew outward, slower sinking |
| Shoho | Japan | No | Bombs/torpedoes | 10 minutes | Rapid destruction from external attack |

**Damage Control Failure:**
- Officer decided to ventilate fumes instead of isolating them
- Spread gasoline vapor throughout ship
- Proper procedure: seal compartments, pump overboard
- Fatal misunderstanding of gasoline vapor danger
- Lack of training with modern fuel systems
- Advanced fire suppression system never activated effectively

**Loss Analysis:**
1. **Single torpedo** from submarine caused all damage
2. **Ruptured fuel tanks** leaked aviation gasoline
3. **Wrong damage control decision** spread fumes throughout ship
4. **Gasoline vapor explosion** 4.5 hours after torpedo hit
5. **Armored deck contained explosion** - increased internal damage
6. **Second explosion** finished the ship
7. **Design irony:** Armor meant to protect became liability

**Historical Context:**
- Commissioned March 1944 - only 3 months before sinking
- First operation was Philippine Sea - never made second
- Most modern IJN carrier destroyed on maiden combat mission
- Represented peak of IJN carrier design
- Loss demonstrated that armor alone couldn't save ships from internal explosions
- 1,650 deaths - one of highest casualty counts for IJN carrier

**What Went Wrong:**
1. **Fuel system vulnerability:** Ruptured easily from single torpedo
2. **Damage control error:** Ventilation instead of isolation
3. **Crew training:** Insufficient preparation for modern damage control
4. **Armor paradox:** Contained explosion instead of allowing venting
5. **Fire suppression:** Advanced system but crew unable to use effectively
6. **Time pressure:** Rushed into combat before crew fully trained

**Legacy:** Taiho's tragic loss demonstrated that armor alone couldn't guarantee carrier survivability. Most modern IJN carrier design, but sunk on first mission by single submarine torpedo and subsequent fuel vapor explosion. Fatal damage control mistake showed that crew training more important than technology. Armored flight deck contained explosion that might have been survivable on unarmored carrier - design irony. Loss of flagship during critical Philippine Sea battle disrupted IJN command. 1,650 deaths made Taiho one of deadliest IJN carrier losses. Name means "Great Phoenix" - never rose from the flames.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Armored flight deck to resist dive bomber attacks
- British Illustrious-class influence
- Modern damage control (theoretical)
- Hurricane bow for heavy weather operations
- Large air group capacity
- High speed for fleet operations
- Most advanced IJN carrier design

**Historical Significance:** Taiho represented IJN's attempt to match British armored carriers. Most sophisticated Japanese carrier design, incorporating all lessons from 2.5 years of war. Tragic loss on first mission epitomized late-war IJN problems: rushed training, fuel vapor management ignorance, design complexity exceeding crew capability. Single submarine torpedo (USS Albacore) caused loss through chain of errors - showed vulnerability of even modern carriers. Philippine Sea battle ("Marianas Turkey Shoot") was devastating - Taiho's loss compounded disaster. Shortest service life of any major carrier - 3 months and 12 days from commission to sinking.
