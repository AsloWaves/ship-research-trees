**Doomed Giant** - Shinano was largest aircraft carrier in world (1944-1955), converted from third Yamato-class battleship. 872 ft, 71,890 tons. Heaviest carrier armor ever (7.5-inch flight deck). Support carrier for ferrying/reserve aircraft. Commissioned November 19, 1944. Sunk by USS Archerfish November 29, 1944 - 10 days after commissioning. Maiden voyage became death voyage. 1,435 killed. Shortest operational life of any major warship.

**Key Specs:** 62,000/71,890 tons | 872ft | 27 kn | 47+50 aircraft | 16× 127mm DP + 145× 25mm AA | 203mm belt, 190mm armored flight deck | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Largest carrier in world until USS Forrestal (1955). Converted from Yamato-class battleship - unique conversion. Thickest carrier armor ever - 7.5-inch flight deck, 3.75-inch hangar sides. Support carrier concept - ferry aircraft and provide reserves to frontline carriers. Could withstand 1,000-lb bombs (design). Battleship construction meant extreme survivability (theoretically). Fatal flaw: rushed into service incomplete, untrained crew, poor watertight integrity.

**Design:** Converted from third Yamato-class battleship (laid down May 1940). Armored flight deck 7.5 inches (190mm) - thickest ever. Battleship hull with carrier superstructure. Single hangar deck (heavily armored). Small island starboard. Support carrier role - not primary strike carrier. Designed to operate near battle zone - armor for protection. Could carry 47 operational + 40-50 reserve/ferry aircraft. Massive AA armament. Radar-equipped. Sacrificed speed (27 knots) for armor.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- Laid down: May 4, 1940 (as Yamato-class battleship)
- Conversion ordered: June 1942 (after Midway)
- Launched: October 8, 1944
- Commissioned: November 19, 1944
- Service life: **10 days**
- Cost: 150+ million yen

**Conversion Decision:**
- Originally third Yamato-class battleship
- **June 1942:** After Midway, conversion to carrier ordered
- Carrier need urgent after loss of Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu
- Battleship hull ~50% complete - major redesign required
- Kept battleship armor and machinery
- Added flight deck and hangar
- Rushed completion as war situation deteriorated

**Service (November 19-29, 1944):**
- **November 19, 1944:** Commissioned at Yokosuka
- Still incomplete - workers still aboard, many systems non-functional
- **November 28, 1944 (7:00 PM):** Departed Yokosuka for Kure (maiden voyage)
- Transfer flight to complete fitting out and load aircraft
- Escort: 3 destroyers (Isokaze, Yukikaze, Hamakaze)
- **November 29, 1944 (3:17 AM):** Torpedoed by USS Archerfish
- **November 29, 1944 (10:57 AM):** Capsized and sank
- **10 days, 18 hours total service**

**Sinking by USS Archerfish (November 29, 1944):**
*Greatest submarine kill in history*

**Background:**
- USS Archerfish (SS-311) on patrol south of Tokyo Bay
- Spotted Shinano departing Yokosuka night of November 28
- Pursued at flank speed for 6 hours
- Shinano zigzagging at 18 knots (not full speed - conserving fuel)

**The Attack (3:17 AM, November 29):**
- Archerfish achieved firing position
- Fired salvo of 6 torpedoes from 1,400 yards
- **Four torpedoes hit** starboard side
- All hits below waterline, amidships
- Massive flooding began immediately

**Fatal Flaws:**
1. **Incomplete watertight integrity:** Many doors/hatches not properly sealed
2. **Rushed construction:** Numerous penetrations in bulkheads not closed
3. **Inexperienced crew:** Damage control teams untrained
4. **Overconfidence:** Captain believed ship unsinkable, continued sailing
5. **Speed maintained:** Continued at 18 knots - forced water through torpedo holes
6. **Delayed counterflooding:** Took too long to correct list
7. **Pumps inadequate:** Couldn't keep up with flooding

**The Sinking:**
- Flooding spread through multiple compartments
- Watertight doors improperly secured - water spread unchecked
- List increased steadily (starboard)
- Captain refused to beach ship or stop engines
- By dawn, list reached 20 degrees
- **10:18 AM:** Order to abandon ship
- **10:57 AM:** Capsized to starboard and sank
- **1,435 killed, 1,080 survivors** (including 55 civilian workers)
- Sank in 4,300 meters of water (never found)

**What Went Wrong:**
1. **Rushed into service:** Should have stayed in shipyard for completion
2. **Incomplete construction:** Watertight integrity compromised
3. **Inexperienced crew:** No time for training or shakedown
4. **Design hubris:** Belief that armor made ship unsinkable
5. **Poor damage control:** Couldn't seal flooding
6. **Captain's decision:** Continued sailing instead of beaching
7. **Speed:** Maintained 18 knots - water pressure forced flooding to spread
8. **Fuel conservation:** Not at full speed - made easier submarine target

**Archerfish Achievement:**
- Largest warship ever sunk by submarine
- Four torpedo hits from single salvo
- 71,890 tons - world record submarine kill (still stands)
- Commander Joseph Enright awarded Navy Cross
- Archerfish survived war, scrapped 1968

**Aircraft Never Embarked:**
- Commissioned without aircraft aboard
- Planned to load at Kure
- Never reached destination
- Empty hangars when sunk
- Planned air group never assembled

**Comparison - Carrier Sizes (1944):**
| Carrier | Nation | Displacement | Length | Aircraft | Status |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Shinano** | **Japan** | **71,890** | **872 ft** | **47+50** | **Sunk 10 days after commission** |
| Essex | USA | 36,380 | 888 ft | 90-100 | Multiple survived war |
| Midway | USA | 60,100 | 968 ft | 130+ | Commissioned 1945, survived to 1992 |

**The Tragedy:**
- Largest carrier in world
- Heaviest armor protection
- Sunk on maiden voyage by submarine
- Only 10 days of service
- Never embarked aircraft
- Never conducted flight operations
- Never fired shot in combat
- 1,435 deaths - all preventable

**Design vs. Reality:**
- **Design:** Unsinkable with battleship armor and construction
- **Reality:** Incomplete construction and rushed commissioning negated armor
- **Design:** Support carrier for frontline operations
- **Reality:** Never reached operational zone
- **Design:** Could survive 1,000-lb bomb hits
- **Reality:** Four torpedoes overwhelmed incomplete watertight integrity

**Legacy:** Shinano represents ultimate wartime tragedy - largest carrier ever built (1944-1955), sunk on maiden voyage before ever operating aircraft. Most expensive IJN ship became most costly failure. Demonstrated that armor and size meaningless without proper construction and crew training. Rushed completion in desperate 1944 circumstances proved fatal. USS Archerfish achieved greatest submarine kill in history - 71,890-ton carrier sunk with four torpedoes. 1,435 deaths for ship that never fought. Name "Shinano" (ancient province, now Nagano) - ironic, as ship never reached safe harbor. Wreck never found - lies in 4,300 meters south of Honshu.

**Historical Significance:** Shinano embodied IJN desperation in late 1944. Yamato-class battleship hastily converted to carrier after Midway. Rushed into service incomplete - fatal decision. Demonstrated that technology and armor couldn't compensate for rushed construction and training. Largest warship sunk by submarine - record still stands. Shortest operational life (10 days) of any major warship. Never fulfilled support carrier role. Waste of resources in losing war. Symbolizes late-war IJN collapse - unable to properly complete and operate even the most powerful ships.

**Conversion Context:**
- Third Yamato-class battleship originally
- Sister ships: Yamato (sunk April 1945), Musashi (sunk October 1944)
- After Midway losses, carrier need desperate
- Conversion seemed logical - use incomplete battleship hull
- Reality: conversion compromised both battleship strength and carrier functionality
- Neither effective battleship nor effective carrier
- Hybrid that failed at both roles

**What If:**
- If properly completed and trained: Might have been effective support carrier
- If used as battleship: Would have complemented Yamato/Musashi
- If stayed in shipyard another 3 months: Might have been functional
- If war ended differently: Would have been world's most powerful carrier
