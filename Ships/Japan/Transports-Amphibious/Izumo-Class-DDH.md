**Japan's New Carriers** - Izumo-class are largest Japanese warships since WWII at 27,000 tons. 2 ships (2015, 2017): Izumo, Kaga. Modified 2020-2024 to operate F-35B stealth fighters. 12 F-35B capacity. First Japanese fixed-wing carriers since 1945.

**Key Specs:** 19,500/27,000 tons | 814ft | 30 kn | 12 F-35B + 6 helos | 16 VLS | Heat-resistant deck

**Innovation:** Largest Japanese warships since WWII, exceeding even WWII Soryu-class carriers (18,800 tons). Originally designed as helicopter destroyers (14 helicopters), both ships underwent 2020-2024 modifications for F-35B STOVL fighter operations. Flight deck received heat-resistant coating withstanding 1,000°C+ jet exhaust, structural reinforcement for vertical landing forces, and bow reshaping from trapezoid to rectangular configuration (improves safety). First Japanese fixed-wing carrier capability in 73 years (since 1945). Named after historic carriers: Izumo (protected cruiser 1900-1945) and Kaga (aircraft carrier sunk at Midway 1942).

**Ships:**
- **JS Izumo (DDH-183)** - Launched 6 Aug 2013, commissioned 25 March 2015, homeport Yokosuka
- **JS Kaga (DDH-184)** - Launched 27 Aug 2015, commissioned 22 March 2017, homeport Kure

**F-35B Modification Program:** October 2018: Japanese government approved F-35B purchase (42 aircraft) and ship modifications. 2020-2023: Izumo first phase modifications. 2022-2024: Kaga first phase modifications. October 2021: First F-35B trials (USMC aircraft on Izumo). October 2024: First US Navy F-35B landing on Kaga. 2024-2027: Second phase modifications (bow reshaping to rectangular). Modifications include flight deck heat-resistant surface, structural reinforcement, power/data connections for F-35B maintenance, enhanced flight control facilities.

**Aviation:** Original configuration (2015-2020): 14 helicopters (9-10× SH-60K Seahawk ASW, 4-5× MCH-101 mine countermeasures/transport). Modified F-35B configuration (2020+): 8-10× F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters + 4-6× helicopters. Maximum surge capacity: 28 aircraft total. Flight deck has 5 simultaneous landing spots. Two aircraft elevators. Full-length hangar deck below flight deck provides all-weather operations.

**Service History:** Primary ASW and disaster relief operations 2015-2019. Regional security patrols (South China Sea, East China Sea). 2017-2019: Amphibious exercises with USMC. 2020-2024: Transformation to light carriers with F-35B modifications. Regular participation in RIMPAC exercises. October 2021: JS Izumo conducted joint exercises with HMS Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group alongside USS Ronald Reagan and USS Carl Vinson. 2024-2025: F-35B operations begin with first Japanese F-35B deliveries.

**Armament:** 16-cell Mk 41 VLS carries up to 64× RIM-162 ESSM (Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile, quad-packed) for air defense plus RUM-139 ASROC anti-submarine capability. 2× Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS (20mm, 6-barrel Gatling guns). 2× Mk 15 Mod 31 SeaRAM (21-cell Rolling Airframe Missile launchers). 6× Mk 36 SRBOC chaff/decoy launchers. NULKA active missile decoy. Anti-torpedo mobile decoy (MOD) and floating acoustic jammer (FAJ).

**Sensors:** OPS-50 3D AESA radar (C-band, track-while-scan up to 203.7 km). FCS-3A AESA fire control radar integrated with weapons systems. OQQ-23 bow-mounted active/passive sonar (submarine tracking up to 74.1 km). OPS-28F surface-search radar. OYQ-12 combat direction system with ATECS integration. NOLQ-3D-1 electronic warfare suite.

**Constitutional Debate:** Officially designated "helicopter destroyers" (DDH) rather than aircraft carriers due to Japanese constitutional constraints (Article 9 prohibits offensive military capability). Design and operation clearly resemble light aircraft carriers, similar to Italian Cavour (27,000 tons) or smaller than UK Queen Elizabeth (65,000 tons). F-35B modifications resolved as "defensive" capability for outer island defense.
