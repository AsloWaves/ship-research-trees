**Revolutionary Landing Craft** - Daihatsu-class were world's first operational bow-ramp landing craft (1932). ~6,000 built (85% of Japanese landing craft). Carried 70 troops or 1 tank. Inspired American LCVP "Higgins Boat" design.

**Key Specs:** 10/21 tons | 47ft | 8 kn | 70 troops OR 1 tank | Bow ramp | 100 nm range

**Innovation:** World's first operational landing craft with retractable bow ramp design (1932), revolutionizing amphibious warfare 9 years before Pearl Harbor. Developed 1924-1925 by IJA, first combat use 29 February 1932 at Shanghai Incident landing IJA 11th Division behind Chinese lines. Photographed by USMC Lt. Victor Krulak during 1937 Battle of Shanghai using telephoto lens. Krulak built balsa wood model and brought concept to Andrew Higgins, directly inspiring American LCVP "Higgins Boat" used on D-Day. Krulak noted: "The Japanese were light years ahead of us in landing craft design."

**Design:** Welded steel hard-chined monohull with hinged bow ramp allowing rapid troop/vehicle disembarkation directly onto beach. W-shaped bow provided stability on beaches. Shallow-draft design (3 ft) with specialized spiral propeller for beach landings without grounding. Could be uparmored with 2-inch (50mm) protective plating on aft section and ramp against small arms fire. Single 60-80 hp diesel or gasoline engine. Minimal crew: 1 pilot required, 12 personnel for effective operations.

**Capacity:** 70 soldiers (design specification called for up to 90). Could alternatively carry: 1× Type 95 Ha-Go light tank (6.5-9 tons), 1× Type 89 I-Go medium tank (12.8 tons), 1 truck, 10-13 tons general cargo, or 10 horses. Range 100 nautical miles at 7.5 knots, 50 nm at 8.5 knots.

**Service History:** First combat use February 1932 Shanghai Incident. Extensive use 1937 Second Sino-Japanese War, including Hangzhou Bay landings. Used in ALL major Japanese amphibious operations throughout Pacific War (1941-1945): Philippines, Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, Guadalcanal (76 craft with 17th Army), Solomon Islands, Burma. Operated with mothership Shinshu Maru for extended range operations. Employed in "Tokyo Express" nighttime supply runs. Critical for Japanese island defense and reinforcement strategies throughout war.

**Variants:**
- **Shohatsu** - 10m smaller version (20 built)
- **Chuhatsu** - 13m variant (~3 built)
- **Daihatsu Type D** - 14m standard model (3,229 built - main production)
- **15m variant** - Improved model (1,140 built)
- **Toku Daihatsu** - 17m enlarged "Super Type A" (163 built, could carry medium tank or two 8-ton tanks)
- **Moku Daihatsu** - Plywood version developed late 1942 due to steel shortage

**Armament:** Typically unarmed. Optional defensive armament: 2× Type 92 heavy machine guns OR 2-3× 25mm/60 anti-aircraft guns. Some upgunned variants mounted weapons up to 37mm caliber. Armor could be added for assault operations.

**Production:** Approximately 6,000 units total (3,229 ordered by Army, adopted by Navy). Represented 85% of all Japanese landing craft types - most successful and widely-produced Japanese landing craft of WWII. Captured craft used by Allied forces in some operations.

**Legacy:** Revolutionary bow ramp design directly influenced Allied landing craft development. Concept photographed 1937, transmitted to US Marine Corps, and incorporated into LCVP which became iconic "Higgins Boat" used on D-Day and throughout Allied island-hopping campaigns. Daihatsu demonstrated that purpose-built landing craft with bow ramps were essential for modern amphibious warfare - lesson adopted by all nations.
