**Pioneer Fleet Oilers** - Notoro-class were Japan's first purpose-built fleet replenishment oilers. 2 ships (1920-1924). 15,150 tons full load. 14 knots. Carried 10,000 tons fuel oil. Pioneered underway replenishment for IJN. Long service life (20+ years). Both lost in WWII - Notoro 1942, Shiretoko 1945.

**Key Specs:** 14,050/15,150 tons | 460ft | 14 kn | 10,000t fuel oil | Underway replenishment | Fleet train

**Development:** Designed 1916-1918 as Japan's first purpose-built fleet oilers (previous fuel supply via converted merchant ships). Japanese Navy studying American and British fleet train concepts - recognized need for mobile fuel supply to support fleet operations far from bases. Washington Naval Treaty (1922) limited battleship construction, redirecting resources to auxiliaries including oilers. Notoro-class represented Japanese investment in fleet logistics capability.

**Ships:**
- **Notoro** - Laid down 1918 at Kawasaki Kobe, launched 1920, commissioned 1920. First purpose-built IJN fleet oiler. Served 22 years. Converted to seaplane tender 1941. Torpedoed and sunk by USS Triton (SS-201) on 11 May 1942 off Shortland Islands (7°10'S, 156°10'E) while serving as seaplane tender. 120+ casualties.

- **Shiretoko** - Laid down 1920, launched 1921, commissioned 1924. Sister ship with minor modifications. Served 21 years. Remained fleet oiler throughout war. Bombed and sunk by USAAF B-25 Mitchell bombers on 13 September 1945 (after Japanese surrender!) off Korea during repatriation support mission. Approximately 200 casualties - tragic loss after war's end.

**Design Features:** Purpose-built oiler design incorporating latest technology:
- Cargo capacity: 10,000 tons fuel oil in segregated tanks
- Replenishment capability: Alongside method - ships came alongside for refueling via hoses
- Pumping systems: Steam-driven pumps, approximately 300 tons/hour transfer rate
- Cargo segregation: Multiple tanks allowing different fuel grades (bunker oil, diesel oil, avgas)
- Hull form: Merchant-type hull optimized for cargo capacity over speed
- Construction: Civilian standards (no armor) but robust build quality
- Deck equipment: Refueling stations port and starboard, fender systems for alongside operations

**Propulsion:** Triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines, 2 shafts, 5,500 shp total:
- Originally coal-fired boilers (1920-1924 as built)
- Converted to oil-fired boilers mid-1920s (ironic for ships carrying oil fuel!)
- Speed: 14 knots maximum, 12 knots economical cruising
- Range: 9,000 nautical miles at 12 knots
- Fuel capacity (ship's own use): 2,500 tons oil

Slow by fleet standards but adequate for logistics train operations. Could keep pace with battleships (21 knots) if battleships slowed for refueling.

**Armament:** Minimal defensive armament:
- 2× 120mm guns (single mounts, bow and stern) - pre-WWII fit
- 2× 75mm Type 88 AA guns (added 1930s)
- 4× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (added late 1930s/early WWII)
- Fire control: Manual aiming, optical sights only

Armament intended to deter merchant raiders and armed merchantmen, not fight warships. Ships relied on fleet escorts for protection.

**Underway Replenishment Operations:** Notoro-class pioneered Japanese underway refueling techniques:
- **Alongside method**: Receiving ship approached oiler on parallel course, matched speed
- **Distance**: Ships maintained 50-100 feet separation during transfer
- **Hoses**: Heavy rubber fuel hoses passed across via messenger lines
- **Transfer rate**: 200-300 tons/hour depending on sea state
- **Conditions**: Operations limited to sea state 3 or less (moderate seas)
- **Multiple ships**: Could refuel two ships simultaneously (port and starboard)

Technique required skilled seamanship from both ships. Dangerous in rough seas - several instances of collisions during practice. By 1941, IJN had refined procedures enabling relatively safe operations.

**Cargo Types:** Ships could carry multiple fuel types in segregated tanks:
- **Bunker C fuel oil**: Heavy fuel oil for battleship/cruiser boilers (bulk of cargo)
- **Diesel oil**: For destroyer and submarine engines
- **Aviation gasoline**: Small quantities for fleet carriers and seaplane tenders
- **Lubricating oils**: Various grades for engines and machinery

Segregated tank system prevented contamination. Ships could simultaneously refuel multiple ship types with different fuel requirements.

**Pre-War Service:** Both ships saw extensive peacetime service 1920s-1930s:
- Fleet exercises and maneuvers (annual grand fleet exercises)
- Training cruises for naval cadets
- Support for China operations (1930s)
- Development of underway replenishment doctrine
- Tested in various sea conditions throughout Pacific

Service revealed capabilities and limitations, informing design of later oiler classes. Ships generally reliable but speed limitation (14 knots) constraining in high-tempo operations.

**Notoro Conversion and Loss:** 1941, Notoro converted to seaplane tender (similar to Kamoi conversion):
- Forward tanks converted to aircraft facilities
- Cranes installed for seaplane handling
- Aviation fuel tankage added
- Retained some fuel oil capacity (dual role)
- Could support 8-12 seaplanes

Conversion reflected desperate need for seaplane tenders. Ship's slow speed and age made it marginal for front-line oiler duty but adequate for tender role. Served as tender in Southwest Pacific (Solomons area) early 1942. Torpedoed by USS Triton 11 May 1942 off Shortland Islands while supporting seaplane operations. Sank quickly - 120+ casualties including aviation personnel. Loss eliminated valuable aviation support capability early in Solomons campaign.

**Shiretoko Wartime Service:** Shiretoko remained fleet oiler throughout war:
- Supported Combined Fleet operations 1941-1942
- Refueling operations at Truk, Rabaul, Palau
- Fuel transport runs from Borneo refineries to Japan
- Fleet train support for remaining capital ships 1943-1945
- Increasingly confined to Inland Sea and Japanese coastal waters as American submarine threat intensified

Ship's slow speed (14 knots) limited to convoy operations and short-range missions. Survived remarkably long given vulnerability - likely due to operating in defended waters and lower priority vs faster, larger tankers.

**Shiretoko Tragic Final Loss:** After Japanese surrender (15 August 1945), Shiretoko assigned to repatriation support operations - transporting fuel for ships bringing Japanese civilians and military personnel home from overseas. 13 September 1945 (nearly one month after surrender), ship attacked by USAAF B-25 Mitchell bombers off Korea. Either pilots unaware of surrender, or mistook ship for legitimate target in chaotic post-surrender period. Shiretoko bombed and sunk - approximately 200 casualties. Tragic loss after war's end. Incident caused diplomatic protest - ships engaged in humanitarian repatriation should have been protected.

**Historical Significance:** Notoro-class pioneered Japanese fleet logistics:
- First purpose-built IJN oilers
- Developed underway replenishment procedures used throughout Pacific War
- Demonstrated necessity of mobile fuel supply for fleet operations
- Long service life (20+ years) testified to solid design
- Training ground for Japanese logistics doctrine

Ships represented unglamorous but essential naval capability. Without oilers, Japanese fleet could not have operated across vast Pacific distances. Notoro-class laid foundation for larger, faster oiler classes (Ondo-class, Hayasui, Naruto-class) built 1930s-1940s.

**Limitations:** Ships suffered limitations due to WWI-era design:
- Slow speed (14 knots) - could not keep pace with fast carrier task forces (30+ knots)
- Small capacity (10,000 tons) - adequate for battleship fleet but insufficient for multi-carrier task forces
- Reciprocating engines - less efficient than turbines, required more maintenance
- Minimal protection - no armor, poor subdivision, vulnerable to single torpedo hit
- Limited self-defense armament

By WWII outbreak, ships obsolescent but retained due to chronic tanker shortage. Newer oilers prioritized for fleet operations; Notoro-class relegated to secondary duties.

**Comparison to American Oilers:** Contemporary American Kanawha-class and Patoka-class oilers (WWI-era) similar specifications:
- Comparable size (14,000-15,000 tons)
- Similar speed (13-15 knots)
- Similar capacity (9,000-12,000 tons fuel)

However, American oilers supplemented by mass-produced Cimarron-class (WWII) and T2/T3 tanker conversions - Japan lacked equivalent production capacity. American oilers survived in higher numbers due to better protection (convoy system, air cover).

**Legacy:** Notoro-class represented pioneering step in Japanese naval logistics. Ships demonstrated fleet train concept viability, enabling Japanese Pacific operations early war. Losses (Notoro 1942, Shiretoko 1945) symbolized gradual attrition of Japanese support infrastructure. Shiretoko's post-surrender loss particularly poignant - survived entire war only to be destroyed during humanitarian mission. No ships survived for preservation - fate typical of unglamorous auxiliary vessels despite historical significance.
