**Aviation Support Auxiliaries** - Mayasan Maru-class were cargo ships converted to seaplane tenders and aircraft transports. 3 ships (1937-1939 built, 1941-1942 converted). 11,800 tons full load. 18 knots. Carried 8-12 seaplanes or 20-30 crated aircraft. Supported advance base seaplane operations. Multi-role: tender, transport, supply. All lost 1943-1945.

**Key Specs:** 9,500/11,800 tons | 465ft | 18 kn | 8-12 seaplanes or 20-30 crated aircraft | 800-1,000 troops

**Background:** Ships were medium cargo vessels built late 1930s for commercial service. Size, speed, and cargo capacity made them suitable for conversion to aviation support roles when Japan's offensive operations required seaplane bases throughout Pacific. Requisitioned 1941-1942 and converted to seaplane tenders - auxiliary vessels supporting seaplane operations at advance bases without established facilities.

**Ships:**
- **Mayasan Maru** - 9,620 GRT, built 1937. Converted to seaplane tender 1941-1942. Could carry 10-12 reconnaissance seaplanes. Torpedoed and sunk by USS Pogy (SS-266) on 16 November 1943 off Formosa during aircraft transport mission. 200-300 casualties.

- **Kunikawa Maru** - 10,086 GRT, built 1938. Converted to seaplane tender and aircraft transport 1942. Operated in Southwest Pacific supporting seaplane units. Bombed and sunk by USAAF aircraft 29 March 1944 at Palau anchorage. 150-250 casualties.

- **Akitsushima Maru** (not to be confused with IJN Akitsushima seaplane tender) - 9,246 GRT, built 1939. Served as aircraft transport and supply ship. Torpedoed by USS Hoe (SS-258) on 13 September 1944 off Philippines. Heavy casualties including aircrew and aviation personnel.

**Seaplane Tender Conversion:** Modifications for seaplane support role:
- Heavy-duty booms and cranes for lifting seaplanes (5-10 ton capacity)
- Deck reinforcement for aircraft handling
- Aviation fuel tankage (avgas storage with safety systems)
- Ordnance magazines for bombs, torpedoes, depth charges
- Maintenance workshops for engine and airframe repair
- Spare parts storage
- Aviation crew accommodations
- Aircraft starting equipment (compressed air)
- Refueling and rearming stations

Ships could support 8-12 operational seaplanes at advance bases without shore facilities. Typical aircraft: Kawanishi E7K "Alf," Aichi E13A "Jake," Mitsubishi F1M "Pete" floatplanes.

**Aircraft Transport Role:** Ships also served as aircraft ferries, transporting:
- 20-30 crated aircraft in holds (fighters, bombers disassembled)
- Complete aircraft on deck (wings removed, secured with tie-downs)
- Aviation fuel and lubricants
- Spare engines and propellers
- Ammunition and ordnance
- Ground support equipment
- Aviation personnel (pilots, mechanics, ground crew)

Critical for reinforcing island airfields and seaplane bases throughout Pacific. High-value targets due to irreplaceable aircraft cargo.

**Operational Seaplane Support:** At advance bases, ships provided complete seaplane support:
- Launched and recovered seaplanes via cranes (no catapult)
- Refueled and rearmed aircraft alongside ship
- Conducted engine changes and major repairs
- Stored torpedoes and bombs for attack missions
- Housed aircrew between missions
- Provided meteorological support
- Communications relay for reconnaissance reports

Ships enabled seaplane operations from islands, atolls, and lagoons without shore infrastructure. Mobile seaplane base concept.

**Dual-Role Capability:** Ships frequently switched between roles based on operational needs:
- **Seaplane tender periods**: Supporting operational seaplane units at advance bases (Rabaul, Truk, Marshalls, Marianas)
- **Aircraft transport periods**: Ferrying replacement aircraft from Japan to forward areas
- **General transport periods**: Carrying troops, cargo, supplies when aviation role not needed
- **Evacuation missions**: Recovering aircraft and personnel from threatened bases

Flexibility made ships valuable but also meant constantly shifting assignments and high operational tempo.

**Mayasan Maru Operations and Loss:** Operated primarily in Central Pacific supporting seaplane reconnaissance units. Based at Truk 1942-1943. Supported seaplane searches for American carrier task forces. November 1943, reassigned to aircraft transport mission - ferrying replacement aircraft from Japan to Philippines. Torpedoed by USS Pogy 16 November 1943 off Formosa while transporting crated aircraft. Ship sank rapidly. Heavy casualties among embarked aviation personnel and crew. Loss of aircraft cargo (estimated 20-25 crated fighters/bombers) severe blow to Philippines air reinforcement.

**Kunikawa Maru Operations and Loss:** Served in Southwest Pacific (New Guinea, Solomons, Bismarcks) supporting seaplane units 1942-1943. Based at Rabaul, provided tender services for reconnaissance and patrol seaplanes. Early 1944, withdrew to Palau as Rabaul became untenable. 29-30 March 1944, destroyed during massive USAAF carrier strike on Palau (Operation Desecrate One). Caught at anchor, suffered direct bomb hits, burned and sank. Casualties included ship's crew, aviation personnel, and embarked seaplane crews. Loss contributed to collapse of Japanese seaplane operations in Western Pacific.

**Akitsushima Maru Operations and Loss:** Operated as aircraft transport and supply ship rather than active seaplane tender. Made multiple runs between Japan and Philippines 1943-1944 ferrying replacement aircraft, aviation supplies, and personnel. September 1944, assigned to emergency reinforcement of Philippines air defenses for Battle of Leyte Gulf. Loaded with crated aircraft and aviation fuel. Torpedoed by USS Hoe 13 September 1944 off Philippines. Massive explosion - aviation fuel ignited. Ship destroyed rapidly. Heavy casualties. Loss of aircraft cargo (estimated 25-30 fighters) weakened Japanese air strength before critical Leyte operations.

**Aviation Cargo Hazards:** Ships faced extreme danger carrying aviation fuel and ordnance:
- Avgas (aviation gasoline) highly volatile - single spark could cause catastrophic explosion
- Bombs and torpedoes magnified damage from any hit
- Crated aircraft represented irreplaceable losses if ship sunk
- Aviation personnel casualties (pilots, mechanics) severely impacted unit readiness

Multiple instances of catastrophic explosions when ships carrying aviation cargo were hit. Mayasan Maru-class and similar aircraft transports among most dangerous assignments in Japanese merchant marine.

**Armament:** Defensive armament standard for auxiliaries:
- 4× 75mm Type 88 AA guns (bow, stern, amidships)
- 10× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (various mounts)
- 12 depth charges with stern racks
- Fire control manual (optical sights)

Armament adequate for deterring merchant raiders but insufficient against determined air or submarine attack. Ships depended on convoy escorts and air cover - both increasingly unavailable 1943-1945.

**Operational Challenges:** Ships faced numerous difficulties:
- Large size made maneuvering difficult at crowded anchorages
- Civilian construction standards - poor damage control
- Volatile cargo (aviation fuel, ordnance) created fire/explosion risk
- Slow speed (18 knots max) vulnerable to submarine attack
- Seaplane handling required calm waters - operations limited by weather
- Lifting seaplanes by crane slow and dangerous in rough seas
- Inadequate anti-aircraft armament given priority target status

**Historical Significance:** Class represented Japan's improvised approach to aviation logistics. Rather than building specialized seaplane tenders (expensive, time-consuming), Japan converted merchant ships for multi-role aviation support. Approach provided flexibility but ships inferior to purpose-built tenders in seaplane support efficiency. Complete class loss (all three ships sunk) reflected high priority American forces gave to Japanese aviation supply chain. Each sinking eliminated significant aviation transport capacity and killed irreplaceable aviation personnel.

**Comparison to Purpose-Built Tenders:** Japanese Navy operated purpose-built seaplane tenders (Chitose, Mizuho, Akitsushima, etc.) with superior capabilities:
- Aircraft catapults for launching heavy seaplanes
- Dedicated hangar facilities
- Better seaplane handling equipment
- Military construction standards (better protection)
- Higher speed (20-22 knots)

Mayasan Maru-class represented economy/desperation conversions - adequate but inferior to specialized ships. By 1943-1945, distinction moot - both purpose-built tenders and conversions being sunk at unsustainable rates.

**Seaplane Operations Decline:** Class entered service during peak Japanese seaplane operations (1942-1943) but sunk just as seaplane role diminishing. By 1944, land-based aircraft and carriers replaced seaplanes for most missions. Seaplane tender role becoming obsolete even as ships being lost. Aircraft transport role increasingly important but equally hazardous. Ships caught in transition between roles, suffering heavy losses in both.
