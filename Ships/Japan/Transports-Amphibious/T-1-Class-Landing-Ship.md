**Japan's First LST Class** - T.1-class were Japan's first purpose-designed Landing Ship Tanks, built 1944-1945. 16 ships. 1,450 tons full load. Carried 8-10 tanks or 500 tons cargo + 200 troops. Bow ramp for direct beach assault. 9 knots.

**Key Specs:** 950/1,450 tons | 250ft | 9 kn | 8-10 tanks | 200 troops | 500t cargo | Bow ramp

**Design:** Emergency wartime design developed 1943-1944 in response to Allied amphibious successes and Japan's increasing defensive requirements. Heavily influenced by captured intelligence on American LST design. Featured flat-bottomed hull for shallow-water beaching, bow ramp for direct unloading onto beaches, and tank deck running full length of ship. Much smaller than Allied LST-2 class (1,450 tons vs 4,080 tons) due to Japan's limited industrial capacity and material shortages. Simple construction with minimal welding, using riveted plates where possible. Could be built in smaller shipyards without specialized facilities.

**Construction:** Built 1944-1945 across multiple small and medium shipyards throughout Japan as war emergency program. Construction time approximately 4-6 months per ship. Many completed too late or lacked fuel for deployment. Hull numbers T.1 through T.16 assigned sequentially. Most laid down late 1944, commissioned early-mid 1945 as Japan prepared for homeland defense against expected Allied invasion.

**Service History:** Entered service too late for offensive operations. Most ships assigned to homeland defense fleet and preparations for Operation Ketsu-Go (defense of Japanese home islands). Several used for emergency troop and supply transport between Home Islands. Some participated in evacuation missions from outlying garrisons. Most ships survived war intact due to late completion and limited operations, but found in deteriorated condition at war's end.

**Landing Operations:** Bow ramp (approximately 12 feet wide) lowered via manual winch system, enabling direct drive-off of tanks, trucks, artillery, and vehicles onto beach. Tank deck approximately 180 feet long, 30 feet wide, with 10-foot overhead clearance. Could carry 8-10 Type 97 medium tanks, or 12-15 trucks, or equivalent mixed cargo. Side doors for troops and light cargo. Optimized for beaching on gradual sandy/gravel beaches typical of Pacific islands. Designed to beach, rapidly discharge, and retract under own power.

**Cargo Capacity:** Maximum cargo load 500 tons including vehicles, supplies, ammunition, fuel drums. Tank deck could accommodate variety of configurations: tanks, artillery pieces, trucks, construction equipment, or palletized cargo. Could transport 200 soldiers in addition to crew, housed in cramped compartments above tank deck. Fresh water capacity limited (7-day supply). No refrigeration - provisions limited to dried/preserved foods.

**Armament:** Light defensive armament only: 1× 75mm Type 88 anti-aircraft gun (bow or stern mount), 4× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (twin mounts, port/starboard positions). Minimal fire control - manual aiming and ranging. Intended to operate under air cover and with destroyer escorts. Some ships may have received additional 25mm guns in final months of war as air threat intensified.

**Engineering:** Twin 700-horsepower diesel engines (total 1,400 shp) driving twin screws. Maximum speed 10 knots (design 9 knots), though most ships struggled to exceed 8 knots due to wartime material quality issues and overloading. Range approximately 3,000 nautical miles at economical 9 knots. Poor fuel quality in late war reduced effective range. Minimal damage control equipment. No auxiliary generators - battery power only when main engines shut down.

**Wartime Service:** Due to late completion (most ships commissioned March-July 1945), saw limited action. Several T-class LSTs participated in:
- Inter-island supply runs in Inland Sea
- Troop transfers for homeland defense repositioning
- Evacuation of equipment from forward bases
- Training exercises for planned homeland defense operations

American bombing and mining of Japanese waters severely limited operations. Many ships never left harbor due to fuel shortages. At least 3 ships damaged by air attack in harbor, 1-2 possibly lost to mines.

**Fate:** Most ships survived war and surrendered to Allied forces August-September 1945. Several used briefly by occupation forces for logistical support and repatriation operations. Most scrapped 1946-1948. A few may have been retained briefly for minesweeping or harbor work before final disposal. None preserved.

**Historical Significance:** Represented Japan's late-war attempt to match Allied amphibious capabilities. Design showed Japanese understanding of LST concept but revealed severe limitations in industrial capacity - produced only 16 ships versus America's 1,000+ LST-2 class. Too little, too late to affect war outcome. Demonstrated desperation of Japan's military situation in final year of war.
