**Medium Steel Landing Craft** - No. 101-class were Japan's standardized medium landing craft, equivalent to American LCM. 80+ built 1943-1945. 45 tons full load. Steel construction. Carried 1 medium tank or 2 trucks or 120 troops. Bow ramp. 9 knots. Supplemented larger Daihatsu-class.

**Key Specs:** 25/45 tons | 56ft | 9 kn | 1 tank or 2 trucks | 120 troops | 30t cargo | Bow ramp

**Development:** Designed 1942-1943 as standardized medium landing craft to supplement larger Daihatsu-class and smaller Shohatsu-class craft. Program initiated in response to increasing amphibious operation requirements across Pacific theater and need for craft capable of transporting tanks directly to beach. Design influenced by captured Allied landing craft and reports from early Pacific campaigns. Steel construction chosen over wood for greater durability, load capacity, and resistance to damage. Simplified design allowing construction in small shipyards and boat-building facilities without specialized equipment.

**Design Features:** Flat-bottomed hull with bow ramp for direct beach landing. Rectangular cargo well approximately 28 feet long, 11 feet wide, with side gunwales 4 feet high. Bow ramp approximately 12 feet wide, lowered via manual winch and cable system. Ramp doubled as bow protection when raised. Simple pilothou se/conning station at stern with basic controls: wheel, throttle, rudder pedal. No protection for crew - open to elements and enemy fire. Single diesel engine (110 hp) driving single propeller. Minimal fuel capacity for short-range operations (150 nm). Draft of only 4 feet when loaded allowed access to very shallow beaches.

**Construction:** Built 1943-1945 across numerous small shipyards, steel fabrication shops, and boat works throughout Japan, Korea, and occupied territories. Construction time approximately 3-4 weeks per craft with experienced workers. Steel plate hulls riveted or welded depending on facility capabilities. Many late-war examples poorly constructed due to material shortages and unskilled labor - leaky hulls and mechanical problems common. Hull numbers assigned sequentially: No. 101, No. 102, etc. Exact total production uncertain - at least 80 confirmed, possibly 100+ built. Many destroyed incomplete in B-29 raids on Japanese ports.

**Cargo Capacity:** Maximum load 30 tons cargo including:
- 1× Type 97 medium tank (15 tons)
- OR 2× Type 94 trucks (3 tons each) + supplies
- OR 1× Type 89 medium tank (12.7 tons) + equipment
- OR artillery piece + ammunition + crew
- OR 30 tons palletized cargo/supplies

Alternative configuration: 120 troops with full combat equipment (approximately 100 kg per soldier). Troops stood or sat on benches/deck during transit - no overhead protection from weather or enemy fire. Mixed loads possible: 1 truck + 40 troops, for example.

**Troop Transport:** When configured for personnel transport, could carry 100-120 fully-equipped soldiers. Troops embarked via bow ramp when craft beached or from dock/ship side. No seating - troops stood holding side gunwales or sat on deck. Extremely uncomfortable in rough seas. No sanitary facilities - suitable only for short transits (30-60 minutes). In emergency, craft sometimes overloaded to 150+ troops, creating severe safety hazard. Some craft fitted with canvas overhead tarpaulin for weather protection (reduced visibility and fire control).

**Operations:** Typical employment:
- Ship-to-shore assault waves from transports anchored offshore
- Inter-island cargo movements in protected waters
- Harbor logistics and supply distribution
- Tank/vehicle ferry between islands
- Evacuation missions from threatened garrisons

Operating doctrine: craft formed waves of 4-8 boats, approached beach in line abreast, beached simultaneously, discharged cargo/troops, retracted and returned to transport ships or depot ships for reloading. Entire cycle typically 1-2 hours depending on distance to beach.

**Armament:** Most craft unarmed as built. Some fitted with light defensive armament 1944-1945:
- 1× 13mm Type 93 heavy machine gun (bow mount, some craft)
- 2× 7.7mm Type 92 machine guns (port/starboard, some craft)
- Rifles and small arms for crew self-defense

Armament primarily for anti-aircraft defense and suppressing beach opposition during landing. No armor protection - vulnerable to even small arms fire. Crew exposed during approach and landing.

**Service History:** Class entered service 1943, saw extensive use throughout Pacific War:
- Philippines campaigns (1944-1945)
- Island reinforcement operations (Marianas, Carolines, New Guinea)
- Homeland defense preparations (1945)
- Inter-island logistics in Inland Sea and Japanese coastal waters
- Post-war repatriation operations (1945-1946)

Heavy losses to air attack, artillery fire during landing operations, and American PT boat attacks. Survivability low due to lack of armor and limited speed. Many craft abandoned or scuttled in final months of war as fuel supplies evaporated.

**Operational Challenges:** Class suffered numerous deficiencies:
- Low speed (9 knots max) made craft vulnerable during beach approach
- Exposed crew position resulted in heavy casualties
- Poor seaworthiness - dangerous in rough conditions
- Minimal range limited operational radius
- Late-war construction quality issues caused frequent breakdowns
- Lack of armament left craft defenseless

Despite limitations, craft filled critical gap in Japanese amphibious capabilities between small Shohatsu-class (7 tons) and large Daihatsu-class (70 tons).

**Comparison to American LCM-3:** Japanese No. 101 class similar in role to US LCM-3 (Landing Craft Mechanized) but inferior in most respects:
- Smaller capacity (30 tons vs 60 tons)
- Slower (9 vs 10 knots)
- Shorter range (150 vs 150 nm - comparable)
- Less seaworthy hull design
- Inferior construction quality

American LCM-3 also mass-produced (8,600+ built) versus Japanese 80-100 units, demonstrating vast disparity in industrial capacity.

**Fate:** Most craft lost during war through combat action, air raids on harbors, or abandonment. Survivors surrendered August 1945. Some used briefly for occupation logistics and repatriation operations. Most scrapped 1946-1948 as surplus. A few may have been seized by Chinese forces (Nationalist and Communist) and used in Chinese Civil War. No known survivors or preserved examples.

**Historical Significance:** Represented Japan's attempt to standardize and mass-produce landing craft for amphibious operations. Entered service too late and in insufficient numbers to significantly impact Pacific campaigns. Class demonstrated Japanese understanding of amphibious warfare requirements but exposed severe industrial limitations compared to American production capacity. More notable as example of Japan's improvised late-war procurement than for tactical impact.
