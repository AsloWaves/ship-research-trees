**Pure Amphibious Assault Ship** - Nigitsu Maru was second ship of Akitsu Maru-class, Japan's purpose-built amphibious assault ships. 11,800 tons. Built 1942-1943. Differed from sister Akitsu Maru by lacking flight deck - pure landing craft carrier configuration. Carried 27 Daihatsu landing craft + 2,200 troops. Torpedoed and sunk by USS Hake 12 January 1944 off Okinawa. 574 killed.

**Key Specs:** 11,800 tons | 499ft | 20 kn | 27 landing craft | 2,200 troops | No flight deck

**Design Background:** Nigitsu Maru was second ship of Akitsu Maru-class, built following experience with first ship Akitsu Maru and prototype Shinshu Maru. While Akitsu Maru featured revolutionary flight deck for aviation support, Nigitsu Maru design simplified:
- No flight deck or aviation facilities (conflicting sources - some indicate flight deck planned but never installed)
- Entire emphasis on landing craft capacity and troop transport
- Design optimized for amphibious assault mission without aircraft complication
- Faster, cheaper construction without flight deck structural requirements

Decision to omit flight deck controversial - reflected debate within Imperial Japanese Army about optimal amphibious ship configuration. Aviation support valuable but flight deck consumed space and added complexity.

**Construction:** Built by Kawasaki Kobe Shipyard. Construction timeline:
- Laid down: 10 March 1942
- Launched: 28 November 1942
- Commissioned: March 1943
- Construction time: approximately 12 months

Faster construction than Akitsu Maru (which required complex flight deck installation). Originally passenger liner (9,547 GRT) converted on the stocks - hull laid down as merchant ship, then modified during construction for military amphibious role. Cost-effective approach using existing merchant hull design.

**Landing Craft Operations:** Could carry 27 Daihatsu-class landing craft (14-meter type) - maximum capacity for ship size:
- Craft stowed in holds and on deck secured to reinforced cradles
- Deployment via stern doors and side davits
- Well deck system for launching craft (details uncertain - some sources indicate stern ramp, others davits only)
- Each Daihatsu: 70 troops or 10 tons cargo or 1 light tank
- Total lift capacity: approximately 1,890 troops per wave or 270 tons cargo

Landing craft deployment enabled rapid beach assault - entire wave launched within 30-45 minutes. Ship designed to anchor offshore (2,000-5,000 meters), launch craft, recover returning craft, repeat cycle.

**Troop Transport:** Carried 2,200 assault troops plus crew:
- Troops housed in holds converted to berthing spaces
- Tiered bunks in former cargo areas
- Accommodations austere - minimal comfort
- Fresh water capacity for 7-10 days
- Galley provided two hot meals daily
- Medical facilities: sick bay with 20-bed capacity, operating room for casualties

Troops trained during transit in landing procedures, weapons handling, and amphibious assault tactics. Ship served as floating training and deployment platform.

**Armament:** Defensive armament identical to Akitsu Maru:
- 2× 75mm/44 Type 88 AA guns (modern dual-purpose weapons)
- 10× 75mm/30 Type 38 guns (older single-purpose guns)
- 20× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (various configurations: triple, twin, single mounts)
- Fire control: manual aiming and ranging, optical sights

Heavy armament for transport ship but inadequate against determined air attack or submarine. Ship relied on convoy escorts for protection.

**Service History:** Nigitsu Maru saw limited service - only 10 months from commissioning to loss:
- March-December 1943: Training exercises, troop transport missions in Japanese home waters
- Deployed on several amphibious assault training operations
- Transported troops and equipment between Home Islands
- Participated in Combined Fleet exercises
- December 1943-January 1944: Assigned to transport mission to Okinawa/Southern Islands

Short service life prevented ship from participating in major operations. Most time spent training and preparation rather than combat missions.

**Final Mission:** January 1944, Nigitsu Maru assigned to transport mission carrying troops and supplies to southern islands (possibly Okinawa or nearby bases). Ship departed Japanese port (likely Sasebo or Kure) in early January 1944 with approximately 900-1,000 troops aboard plus crew.

**Sinking:** 12 January 1944, southeast of Okinawa (23°15'N, 132°51'E):
- USS Hake (SS-256) on patrol detected large ship via periscope
- Commander John Broach identified ship as large transport/amphibious vessel
- Hake shadowed ship throughout day, maneuvering into attack position
- Late afternoon, Hake fired spread of 6 torpedoes from 1,000 yards
- Two torpedoes struck Nigitsu Maru amidships and aft
- Torpedo hits flooded engine room, causing progressive flooding
- Ship lost power, began settling by stern
- Evacuation order given but ship sinking rapidly
- Nigitsu Maru sank in approximately eight minutes
- 574 killed: 456 soldiers (troops being transported), 83 gunners (AA gun crews), 35 crew
- Survivors (exact number uncertain, possibly 400-500) rescued by escort vessels

Rapid sinking time (8 minutes) prevented effective evacuation. Majority of troops below decks trapped when ship went down. Heavy casualties among embarked soldiers represented significant loss for Japanese Army.

**Loss Analysis:** Sinking demonstrated amphibious ship vulnerabilities:
- Large, slow target easily detected by submarines
- No anti-submarine protection (no sonar, no depth charges effective vs submerged submarine)
- Poor damage control due to civilian-standard construction
- Large open spaces (landing craft holds) compromised watertight integrity
- Single torpedo hit often fatal for auxiliary vessels
- Overcrowding with troops increased casualties

Speed of 16-20 knots inadequate against submerged submarine with acoustic torpedoes. Ship needed destroyer escort with active sonar and depth charge capability - convoy protection apparently insufficient or absent during attack.

**Impact of Loss:** Nigitsu Maru sinking severely impacted Japanese amphibious capabilities:
- Only 10 months in service - massive waste of resources and construction effort
- Loss eliminated 50% of Akitsu Maru-class capacity (2 ships built, 1 lost)
- 574 casualties included trained assault troops and ship specialists
- Reduced Japanese ability to conduct amphibious counter-attacks
- Loss demonstrated vulnerability of large amphibious ships to submarine threat

After Nigitsu Maru loss, remaining amphibious ships (Akitsu Maru, converted merchantmen) operated with extreme caution, limiting effectiveness.

**Comparison to Sister Ship Akitsu Maru:**
- **Akitsu Maru**: Flight deck, 20 aircraft capacity, aviation-amphibious hybrid. Lost November 1944 (10 additional months service)
- **Nigitsu Maru**: No flight deck, maximum landing craft capacity, pure amphibious. Lost January 1944

Akitsu Maru's aviation capability possibly contributed to longer survival - aircraft could provide anti-submarine patrol. Nigitsu Maru's lack of organic air support may have made ship more vulnerable. However, both ships ultimately sunk by submarine attack, suggesting flight deck made minimal survival difference.

**Historical Significance:** Nigitsu Maru represented Japanese commitment to purpose-built amphibious warfare ships but exposed cruel realities:
- Even purpose-built ships highly vulnerable to submarine attack
- Japanese anti-submarine defenses inadequate to protect high-value amphibious assets
- American submarine offensive strangled Japanese amphibious capability
- Short service life (10 months) demonstrated unsustainable loss rates
- Heavy casualties (574 dead) from single sinking traumatic for Japanese forces

Ship's loss contributed to Japanese decision to avoid large amphibious operations 1944-1945, shifting to defensive strategy.

**Comparison to Allied Amphibious Ships:** Nigitsu Maru's fate contrasted with Allied amphibious vessels:
- American LSTs suffered losses but produced in thousands - losses replaceable
- British and American amphibious ships operated with strong ASW protection
- Allied air superiority protected amphibious fleets
- Japanese amphibious ships isolated, vulnerable, unsupported

Loss exemplified larger strategic imbalance: Japan could not afford to lose scarce amphibious assets; America could absorb losses and continue operations.

**Legacy:** Nigitsu Maru largely forgotten compared to sister ship Akitsu Maru (aviation capability made Akitsu Maru more historically interesting). Nevertheless, Nigitsu Maru's pure amphibious assault configuration represented valid design approach - maximum landing craft and troop capacity without aviation complexity. Ship's tragic early loss prevented validation of design concept. Modern amphibious assault ships (LPD, LSD types) more closely resemble Nigitsu Maru (landing craft focus) than Akitsu Maru (aviation-amphibious hybrid), suggesting Nigitsu Maru concept ultimately vindicated despite ship's loss.
