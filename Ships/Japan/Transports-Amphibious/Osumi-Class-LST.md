**Modern Amphibious Capability** - Osumi-class are Japan's first modern amphibious assault ships since WWII. 3 ships (1998-2003): Osumi, Shimokita, Kunisaki. 14,000 tons. Carry 2 LCAC + 10 tanks + 330 troops. Osprey-capable.

**Key Specs:** 8,900/14,000 tons | 584ft | 22 kn | 2 LCAC | 10-14 MBTs | 330 troops | 8 helo spots

**Innovation:** First modern amphibious warfare capability for JMSDF, designed as "Landing Ship Tank" but functionally operates as Landing Ship Dock with 60-70m well deck. Carrier-like appearance with flat deck raised regional concerns in 1990s. Can transport 10 Type 90 MBTs (48 tons each) or 40 large vehicles. Two LCAC hovercraft provide over-the-horizon amphibious assault capability at 40+ knots. No traditional bow doors/beaching capability - relies entirely on well deck operations.

**Ships:**
- **JS Osumi (LST-4001)** - Launched 18 Nov 1996, commissioned 11 March 1998 (first)
- **JS Shimokita (LST-4002)** - Launched 29 Nov 2000, commissioned 12 March 2002
- **JS Kunisaki (LST-4003)** - Launched 13 Dec 2001, commissioned 26 Feb 2003

**Service:** Major disaster relief operations: 1999 Turkish earthquake (Osumi sailed 9,000+ nm to Mediterranean), 2011 Tohoku earthquake/tsunami (all 3 ships deployed within 45 minutes), 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (hosted US Marine MV-22 Ospreys). Regular joint exercises with US Navy amphibious forces. Support for JGSDF Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade (established 2018). All three assigned to Landing Division 1, Kure Naval Base.

**Modifications:** Originally designed for 2 CH-47 Chinook helicopters with unenclosed flight deck supporting up to 8 helicopters. Fin stabilizers added 2006 (8 years post-commissioning) to improve helicopter operations. 2014-2020 modifications added MV-22 Osprey capability and AAV7A1 amphibious vehicle support. Flight deck strengthened and aviation fuel capacity increased.

**Armament:** Defensively armed with 2× Phalanx 20mm CIWS (6-barrel Gatling guns, 3,000-4,500 rpm) and 2× Browning M2 12.7mm heavy machine guns. No offensive armament - designed for amphibious logistics and humanitarian operations rather than combat assault.

**Design:** 100-meter vehicle deck forward below main deck. Well deck aft accommodates 2 LCAC simultaneously. "Island" superstructure starboard side resembles small carrier. Tactical Air Navigation System (TACAN) added post-commissioning for helicopter operations. Crew of 135 plus 330 troops standard (can surge to 1,000+ for humanitarian evacuation).
