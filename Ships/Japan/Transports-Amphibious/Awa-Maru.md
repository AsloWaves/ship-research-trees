**Tragic Humanitarian Mission** - Awa Maru was Japanese passenger-cargo liner granted safe conduct by Allies for relief mission to Allied POWs in Japanese camps. 11,249 GRT, 498 feet, 19 knots. Carried Red Cross supplies to POW camps February-April 1945. Torpedoed and sunk by USS Queenfish 1 April 1945 despite safe passage guarantee. 2,004 killed, 1 survivor. Most controversial naval incident of Pacific War.

**Key Specs:** 11,249 GRT | 498ft | 19.5 kn | Relief supplies | Unarmed | Safe conduct protection

**Background:** Built 1943 by Mitsubishi Nagasaki Shipyard as passenger-cargo liner for Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line). Entered service late 1943 on Southeast Asia routes. Modern, well-equipped ship with comfortable passenger accommodations (capacity ~300 passengers) and 2,200-ton cargo capacity. Requisitioned for military transport service, carried troops and supplies throughout 1943-1944. Survived war's hazards until selected for special humanitarian mission early 1945.

**Relief Mission Origins:** By early 1945, Allied prisoners of war in Japanese camps throughout Asia faced starvation and medical supply shortages. International Red Cross negotiated with Japanese and Allied governments for relief supply delivery. Japan proposed using Awa Maru as dedicated relief ship under Red Cross protection. Allies (primarily United States) agreed to safe passage guarantee:
- Ship to be illuminated at night
- Red Cross markings prominently displayed
- Unarmed
- Strictly limited to carrying relief supplies and Red Cross parcels
- Specific route and schedule provided to Allied commands
- Promise of safe passage from submarine and air attack

Agreement signed February 1945 - rare humanitarian gesture in otherwise ruthless Pacific War.

**Relief Cargo:** Awa Maru loaded with approximately 2,200 tons relief supplies at Moji, Japan:
- Red Cross parcels for Allied POWs
- Medical supplies (medicines, bandages, surgical instruments)
- Food (canned goods, rice, protein supplements)
- Clothing and blankets
- Vitamin supplements
- Hygiene supplies
- Mail and personal items for POWs

Cargo meticulously inspected by International Red Cross representatives to ensure compliance with safe conduct agreement - no military contraband allowed. Ship marked with large Red Cross symbols on hull sides, superstructure, and deck. Illuminated at night with floodlights per agreement terms.

**Route and Mission:** Departed Moji, Japan on 17 February 1945 for multi-port humanitarian mission:
- Singapore (delivered supplies to Changi POW camp)
- Saigon, French Indochina
- Jakarta (Batavia), Java
- Various Southeast Asian ports with POW camps

Ship made multiple port calls February-March 1945, successfully delivering relief supplies to Allied prisoners. Welcomed by POWs as symbol of hope. Mission initially successful - ship safely navigated waters patrolled by Allied submarines and aircraft thanks to safe conduct notification.

**Return Voyage:** Departed Singapore 28 March 1945 for return to Japan via northern route through Formosa Strait. Ship carried relief mission staff, Red Cross representatives, Japanese civilians being repatriated from Southeast Asia. Estimated 2,000-2,400 passengers and crew aboard - far exceeding normal capacity. Ship maintained illumination and Red Cross markings per agreement. Scheduled to pass through Formosa Strait night of 1 April 1945.

**Tragic Sinking:** Night of 1 April 1945, approximately 11:00 PM, in Taiwan Strait south of Formosa (25°03'N, 119°59'E). Heavy fog reduced visibility to near zero. USS Queenfish (SS-393), on patrol in area, detected large ship on radar proceeding at high speed. Commander Charles Elliott Loughlin observed radar contact but could not visually identify ship due to fog. Red Cross markings and illumination not visible in dense fog. Loughlin interpreted large, fast-moving radar contact as Japanese warship or valuable military transport.

USS Queenfish fired 4 torpedoes. Multiple hits. Awa Maru sank in approximately 2-3 minutes - catastrophic sinking. Of 2,004 aboard, only 1 survivor: Shimoda Kantaro, ship's quartermaster, rescued by Queenfish. 2,003 dead including passengers, crew, and Red Cross personnel. One of highest death tolls for single Japanese merchant ship sinking.

**Controversy and Aftermath:** Sinking immediately recognized as catastrophic error. USS Queenfish surfaced to find debris field and single survivor who identified ship as Awa Maru. Commander Loughlin immediately reported incident. American government profoundly embarrassed - violation of explicit safe conduct agreement. Japan lodged formal protest demanding accountability. United States:
- Acknowledged error and apologized
- Court-martialed Commander Loughlin (reduced in rank, letter of reprimand - relatively light punishment)
- Offered compensation to Japan
- Incident became international diplomatic crisis

Japan used incident for propaganda purposes, claiming American betrayal of humanitarian principles. Post-war, incident remained contentious issue in US-Japan relations.

**Controversies and Theories:** Numerous theories and controversies surround sinking:

**Was Awa Maru carrying contraband?** Some sources claim ship's return voyage carried illegal military cargo:
- Rubber from Southeast Asia (critical war material)
- Tin and other strategic metals
- Possibly looted gold and valuables from occupied territories
- Allegations ship violated safe conduct terms

If true, would partially justify attack, though US command had no knowledge of contraband at time. Post-war investigations inconclusive.

**Was safe conduct properly communicated?** Questions whether all US submarine commanders adequately informed of Awa Maru's route and schedule. Loughlin claimed inadequate notification. US Navy maintained proper notification given but fog prevented visual identification.

**Why did ship sink so quickly?** 2-3 minute sinking time suggests:
- Torpedo hit magazine or boiler rooms causing explosion
- Poor watertight integrity (civilian construction)
- Severe overloading compromised stability
- Possible illegal cargo (rubber, metals) increased density

Rapid sinking prevented evacuation - only 1 survivor from 2,004 aboard.

**Salvage Operations:** 1980, Chinese salvage company located and partially salvaged wreck in Taiwan Strait. Salvage revealed:
- Large quantities of rubber in holds
- Some metal ingots (tin, possibly gold)
- Personal belongings of passengers
- No definitive evidence of major military contraband

Salvage findings suggested ship may have been carrying some contraband but not major military cargo. Exact nature of return cargo remains disputed.

**Legal and Moral Questions:** Incident raised profound questions:
- Legitimacy of attacking ship under safe conduct despite visibility issues
- Responsibility when safe conduct vessel allegedly carries contraband
- Adequacy of Commander Loughlin's identification procedures before attack
- Whether radar contact alone sufficient justification
- Moral weight of 2,003 civilian deaths vs military necessity

No clear consensus reached. Incident remains cautionary tale about fog of war and humanitarian protections in total war context.

**Historical Significance:** Awa Maru sinking most controversial Allied submarine attack of Pacific War. Demonstrated:
- Limits of safe conduct agreements in modern warfare
- Technology (radar) enabling attacks beyond visual identification
- Difficulty maintaining humanitarian channels during total war
- Tragic consequences of identification errors
- Post-war diplomatic complications from wartime incidents

Incident contrasts with German hospital ship attacks (questioned legitimacy) but different because US acknowledged error and apologized. Nevertheless, remains dark chapter in US submarine warfare history.

**Memorialization:** Victims commemorated in Japan. Incident featured in numerous books, documentaries, and studies of Pacific War. Sole survivor Shimoda Kantaro gave testimony about sinking, died 1980s. Wreck site in Taiwan Strait remains war grave. Salvage operations 1980s controversial - many Japanese considered disturbance of wreck disrespectful to dead.

**Commander Loughlin's Defense:** Loughlin maintained throughout life that:
- Heavy fog made visual identification impossible
- Radar contact indicated large, fast ship on known Japanese shipping route
- Safe conduct notification not adequately communicated to submarine commanders
- Actions consistent with aggressive submarine warfare doctrine
- Tragic accident, not negligence

Court-martial relatively lenient (reduction in rank, letter of reprimand) suggested US Navy acknowledged difficult circumstances. Loughlin later reinstated to rank, retired honorably.
