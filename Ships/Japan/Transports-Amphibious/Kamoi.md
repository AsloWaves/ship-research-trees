**Unique Multi-Role Auxiliary** - Kamoi was Japanese fleet oiler converted to seaplane tender (1932), then reconverted to oiler (1943). 17,000 tons full load. Built 1922. Served as oiler (1922-1932), seaplane tender (1932-1943), oiler again (1943-1945). Survived Pacific War intact. Rare example of double conversion and long service life. Scrapped 1947.

**Key Specs:** 14,050/17,000 tons | 485ft | 15 kn | 12-20 seaplanes (as tender) or 10,000 tons fuel oil (as oiler)

**Original Construction:** Built 1920-1922 at Kawasaki Kobe Shipyard as fleet replenishment oiler for Imperial Japanese Navy. Commissioned 1922. Design based on American oiler concepts - large fuel capacity, moderate speed, replenishment-at-sea capability. Specifications:
- Cargo capacity: 10,000 tons fuel oil
- Replenishment capability: Could refuel ships underway (alongside method)
- Speed: 15 knots (adequate for fleet train operations)
- Endurance: 10,000 nm at 12 knots

Served throughout 1920s as fleet oiler supporting Japanese Navy exercises and deployments. Reliable but unremarkable service. Considered for disposal early 1930s as newer, faster oilers entered service.

**First Conversion: Oiler to Seaplane Tender (1932):** Rather than scrapping, IJN converted Kamoi to seaplane tender 1931-1932 at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. Major modifications:
- Forward cargo tanks converted to aircraft hangars
- Aircraft handling cranes installed (20-ton capacity)
- Flight deck area created (no catapult initially)
- Aviation fuel tankage (avgas separate from ship's fuel oil)
- Ordnance magazines for bombs, torpedoes, depth charges
- Maintenance workshops and spare parts storage
- Crew accommodations expanded for aircrew
- Two catapults added (Type Kure No. 2) for launching heavy seaplanes

Conversion cost approximately 30% of new construction - economical way to expand seaplane tender force. Ship could support 12-20 operational seaplanes depending on type. Retained significant fuel oil capacity (reduced from 10,000 to 6,000 tons) - could still serve as auxiliary oiler.

**Seaplane Tender Service (1932-1943):** Kamoi operated as seaplane tender for 11 years, supporting IJN seaplane reconnaissance and patrol units:
- Pre-war: Training exercises, fleet maneuvers
- China Incident (1937-1941): Supported seaplane operations along Chinese coast
- Early Pacific War: Supported seaplane reconnaissance units in Central Pacific (Marshalls, Marianas)
- Based at Truk, Kwajalein, Saipan at various times
- Supported Kawanishi H6K "Mavis" and H8K "Emily" flying boats - large reconnaissance seaplanes
- Launched/recovered seaplanes via cranes (no water landing required at ship location)
- Provided refueling, rearming, maintenance at advance bases

Service generally successful but ship's age (built 1922) and slow speed (15 knots) limited usefulness. By 1943, obsolescent for front-line tender duty.

**Second Conversion: Tender Back to Oiler (1943):** Mid-1943, Japanese Navy facing critical fuel shortage and tanker losses mounting rapidly. Decision made to reconvert Kamoi to oiler role - reverse of 1932 conversion. Work conducted at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, summer 1943:
- Seaplane equipment removed (catapults, cranes, hangars)
- Cargo tanks restored/expanded for fuel oil
- Capacity increased to approximately 8,000-9,000 tons fuel oil
- Aviation facilities removed
- Minimal armament retained: 2× 120mm guns, 4× 75mm AA, 8× 25mm AA
- Conversion took approximately 2 months

Kamoi returned to oiler role September 1943, serving final two years of war as fleet replenishment tanker.

**Final War Service (1943-1945):** As oiler, Kamoi supported Japanese fleet operations and transported fuel between refineries and naval bases:
- Refueled warships at Truk, Palau, Philippines
- Transported fuel oil from Borneo refineries to Japan
- Supported Combined Fleet operations
- Ran gauntlet of American submarines repeatedly

Remarkably, ship survived war despite slow speed (15 knots) and high-value target status. Probably survived due to:
- Low priority vs faster, larger tankers
- Often operated in defended waters (Inland Sea)
- Extensive convoy operations with destroyer escorts
- Some luck avoiding submarine contacts

Several near-misses: attacked by submarines at least twice, narrowly escaped. Minor damage from air raids on harbors. Ship's slow speed actually may have helped - submarines often prioritized faster, more valuable targets.

**Post-War Fate:** Survived war intact, surrendered August 1945 at Kure. Used briefly by Allied occupation forces for fuel transport supporting repatriation operations. Decommissioned 1946. Scrapped 1947 at Osaka. Remarkable 25-year service life (1922-1947) unusual for auxiliary vessel.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Hull: Riveted steel construction, single continuous deck
- Propulsion: Triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines, 2 shafts, 6,500 shp
- Original fuel: Coal-fired boilers (converted to oil-fired 1925)
- Speed: 15 knots maximum, 12 knots cruising
- Armament (WWII): 2× 120mm guns, 4× 75mm AA, 8× 25mm AA (minimal for ship size)
- As oiler: 8,000-9,000 tons fuel oil capacity, alongside refueling capability
- As tender: 12-20 seaplanes (flying boats), 6,000 tons fuel oil retained

**Seaplane Operations Detail:** As tender (1932-1943), Kamoi supported large flying boats:
- **Kawanishi H6K "Mavis"**: 4-engine flying boat, 30m wingspan, used for long-range reconnaissance
- **Kawanishi H8K "Emily"**: 4-engine flying boat, 38m wingspan, advanced long-range patrol aircraft
- **Smaller types**: Aichi E13A "Jake," Mitsubishi F1M "Pete" floatplanes

Ship's heavy cranes could lift aircraft up to 20 tons - essential for handling large flying boats. Catapults could launch aircraft up to 15 tons. Maintenance facilities could perform engine changes, structural repairs, complete overhauls. Aviation fuel capacity (1,000+ tons) supported extended operations without resupply.

**Operational Challenges:** Ship suffered limitations throughout service:
- **Slow speed**: 15 knots maximum made ship vulnerable, slow to reposition
- **Old age**: Built 1922, outdated by WWII standards - frequent mechanical problems
- **Civilian construction standards**: Minimal protection, poor subdivision, vulnerable to torpedo
- **Conversions**: Multiple role changes reduced efficiency in all roles - neither ideal oiler nor ideal tender
- **Size**: Large (17,000 tons) made maneuvering difficult, conspicuous target

Despite limitations, ship fulfilled critical needs during both tender and oiler service periods.

**Historical Significance:** Kamoi unique in Japanese Navy - only ship converted from oiler to seaplane tender, then reconverted to oiler. Represented Japanese flexibility and resourcefulness in face of changing operational requirements:
- 1932: Seaplane tender force expansion needed - convert existing oiler
- 1943: Tanker shortage critical - reconvert to oiler

Ship's survival remarkable - most Japanese auxiliaries lost during war. Longevity (25 years) unusual for fleet auxiliary. Service life spanned multiple eras: interwar period, China war, Pacific War, occupation. Witnessed Japanese naval power rise and fall.

**Comparison to Other Conversions:** Most IJN conversions one-way:
- Passenger liners to escort carriers (Taiyo-class) - permanent
- Merchant ships to seaplane tenders - permanent
- Oilers to transports - permanent

Kamoi's double conversion unusual - reflected desperately changing priorities 1932 (expand seaplane force) vs 1943 (critical tanker shortage). Ship's base oiler design with large cargo capacity enabled reconversion - most specialized conversions irreversible.

**Legacy:** Kamoi exemplified Japanese Navy's make-do approach using older ships for auxiliary roles. Not glamorous or celebrated but performed unglamorous, essential work: fuel logistics, seaplane support. Survived when newer, better ships sunk. Scrapped inglorious end for ship that witnessed quarter-century of Japanese naval history.
