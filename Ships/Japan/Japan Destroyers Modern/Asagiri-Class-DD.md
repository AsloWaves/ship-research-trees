**Pre-VLS General Purpose Destroyers** - Asagiri-class were JMSDF's general-purpose destroyers before VLS adoption. 8 ships commissioned 1988-1991. 4,200 tons, 30 knots, balanced armament (ASW, AAW, anti-surface). Pre-VLS design: Mk 29 launcher (8-cell Sea Sparrow), ASROC octuple launcher, 8× Harpoon SSM. 76mm Oto Melara gun, 2× Phalanx CIWS. SH-60J helicopter (ASW). COGOG propulsion (gas turbines only). OQS-4A hull sonar, OQR-1 TACTASS towed array. Last JMSDF destroyers without VLS (Murasame-class 1996+ introduced 16-cell VLS, later upgraded to 32-cell). All 8 served 32-35 years (1988-1991 to 2020-2023). All retired by March 2023. Replaced by Mogami-class frigates. Asagiri-class: Capable workhorses, bridge between Cold War and modern designs.

**Key Specs:** 3,500/4,200 tons | 450ft | 30 kn | 76mm + Mk 29 SAM + ASROC + Harpoon | 8 ships | All retired

**Innovation:** **Last pre-VLS Japanese destroyers** (1988-1991). Transitional design: Traditional launchers vs modern VLS (Murasame 1996+ had 16-cell VLS). **Mk 29 launcher**: 8-cell NATO Sea Sparrow (point defense), trainable launcher, manual reload. **ASROC octuple launcher**: 8 ASW rockets (anti-submarine), fixed box launcher. Contrast: Murasame VLS could launch SAMs or ASROC from same cells (flexibility). **COGOG propulsion**: COmbined Gas Or Gas - Rolls-Royce Olympus gas turbines (cruise) + Rolls-Royce Tyne gas turbines (boost) = 53,000 shp. No diesels (unlike some JMSDF ships). Advantages: Fast startup, high power. Disadvantages: Higher fuel consumption vs CODOG. **Balanced armament**: ASW (ASROC, torpedoes, SH-60J helicopter), AAW (Mk 29 Sea Sparrow, 2× Phalanx), Anti-surface (8× Harpoon SSM, 76mm gun). **SH-60J**: Mitsubishi-built Seahawk (ASW missions, search/rescue). OQS-4A hull sonar + OQR-1 towed array (comprehensive ASW sensor suite). FCS-2-21 fire control (Japanese indigenous). OYQ-6 combat system (tactical data system). Crew 220 (automation less advanced than later ships). 8 ships (smaller class vs Hatsuyuki 12 ships) - transitioning to VLS designs.

**Design:** Conventional destroyer hull (450 ft, 4,200 tons full). **76mm Oto Melara Super Rapid**: Forward mount, fast-firing (120 rounds/minute), anti-air/anti-surface. **Mk 29 launcher**: Forward superstructure (after bridge), 8-cell box launcher, NATO Sea Sparrow missiles, trainable mount. **8× Harpoon SSM**: Two quad canisters midships (port/starboard), anti-ship missiles (70+ nm range). **ASROC octuple launcher**: Aft superstructure, 8 cells (fixed box), anti-submarine rockets (10 nm range). **Two Phalanx CIWS**: One forward (above bridge), one aft (close-in defense), 20mm rotary cannons. **Two triple 324mm torpedo tubes**: Port/starboard amidships, Mk 46 torpedoes (ASW homing). **Helicopter hangar/flight deck aft**: SH-60J Seahawk (ASW helicopter). **OPS-14C air search radar**: Mainmast (rotary antenna). **OPS-28D surface search**: Aft mast. **FCS-2-21 fire control**: Gun/missile directors. **OQS-4A sonar**: Bow dome (hull-mounted, active/passive). **OQR-1 TACTASS**: Towed array (long-range passive detection). **COGOG propulsion**: Olympus + Tyne gas turbines, two shafts, 30 knots. Clean, functional profile (typical late-Cold War destroyer). JMSDF gray livery.

**Pre-VLS Design - Obsolete by 2000s:**

**What is VLS:**
- **Vertical Launch System**: Missile cells (vertical tubes), missiles launched vertically
- **Advantages**:
  1. Faster launch (no training launcher)
  2. Simultaneous launches (multiple missiles at once)
  3. Flexibility (load different missiles - SAMs, ASROC, Tomahawk, etc.)
  4. Survivability (missiles protected in armored cells)
  5. Lower profile (flush deck vs trainable launchers)

**Asagiri's Traditional Launchers:**

**Mk 29 Sea Sparrow Launcher:**
- 8-cell box launcher (trainable, points at target)
- NATO Sea Sparrow missiles (point defense, ~10 nm range)
- Manual reload (slower than VLS)
- Single target engagement (launcher trains to target, fires, trains to next)
- Exposed (above-deck, vulnerable to damage)

**ASROC Octuple Launcher:**
- 8 cells (fixed box, aft superstructure)
- ASROC rockets (anti-submarine, ~10 nm range)
- No reload (8 shots only - ship must return to port)
- Fixed orientation (ship must maneuver to fire)

**Comparison - Murasame VLS (1996+):**
- **16-cell Mk 41 VLS** (later upgraded to 32-cell on most ships)
- Flexibility: Load mix of Sea Sparrow (ESSM quad-packed = 64 missiles), ASROC ASW
- Simultaneous launches (engage multiple targets)
- Reload capability (but not at sea - return to port)
- **Result**: Murasame far superior to Asagiri (more missiles, faster engagement, flexible loadout)

**Why Asagiri Pre-VLS:**
- Designed mid-1980s (VLS new technology)
- Mk 41 VLS adopted by US Navy 1986 (USS Ticonderoga)
- Japan adopted VLS: Murasame (1996), Kongo Aegis (1993)
- Asagiri: Transitional design (traditional launchers, last generation)

**COGOG Propulsion:**

**COmbined Gas Or Gas:**
- **Two types of gas turbines**:
  1. **Cruise turbines**: Rolls-Royce Tyne (fuel-efficient, lower power)
  2. **Boost turbines**: Rolls-Royce Olympus (high power, fuel-hungry)
- **Operation**: Use Tyne for cruising (fuel efficiency), switch to Olympus for high speed (combat/pursuit)
- **"OR"**: One OR the other (not both simultaneously - unlike COGAG = Combined Gas And Gas)

**Asagiri's System:**
- 4× Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B (boost) - 28,000 shp each
- 2× Rolls-Royce Tyne RM1C (cruise) - 5,000 shp each
- Total: 53,000 shp (boost mode)
- Two shafts (each shaft can use cruise or boost turbine)

**Advantages:**
- Fast startup (gas turbines spool up quickly vs steam boilers)
- High power-to-weight (compact, powerful)
- Good acceleration (switch cruise → boost rapidly)

**Disadvantages:**
- Fuel consumption (gas turbines thirstier than diesels at cruise)
- Maintenance (complex turbine systems)
- Cost (gas turbines expensive)

**Comparison - Other JMSDF Propulsion:**
- Murasame: **COGAG** (Combined Gas And Gas - all 4 turbines run together = 61,000 shp, 30 knots)
- Takanami: **COGAG** (60,000 shp, 30 knots)
- Mogami: **CODAG** (COmbined Diesel And Gas - diesels cruise, gas turbines boost = more efficient)

**All-Mist Names:**

**Thematic Naming (-giri = mist):**
- All 8 ships named for mists
- **Asagiri**: Morning Mist
- **Yamagiri**: Mountain Mist
- **Yugiri**: Evening Mist
- **Amagiri**: Rain Mist (also honors WWII destroyer)
- **Hamagiri**: Beach Mist
- **Setogiri**: Strait Mist
- **Sawagiri**: Refreshing Mist
- **Umigiri**: Sea Mist

**Japanese Naval Tradition:**
- Destroyer names: Weather, natural phenomena, winds, mists
- Poetic, evocative names
- Cultural significance (mists in Japanese art, poetry)

**Amagiri Special Significance:**
- Honors WWII **Fubuki-class destroyer Amagiri**
- August 2, 1943: **Amagiri rammed PT-109** (Blackett Strait, Solomons)
- PT-109 commanded by: **Lieutenant John F. Kennedy** (future US President)
- Kennedy's crew rescued after 6 days
- Amagiri survived war until April 23, 1944 (bombed, sank off Makassar)
- Modern Amagiri DD-154: Honors name, historical connection

**32-35 Year Service Lives - Excellent:**

**Long Careers:**
- Asagiri: 1988-2020 (32 years)
- Yamagiri: 1989-2021 (32 years)
- Yugiri: 1989-2022 (33 years)
- Amagiri: 1990-2022 (32 years)
- Hamagiri: 1991-2022 (31 years)
- Setogiri: 1991-2021 (30 years)
- Sawagiri: 1991-2023 (32 years)
- Umigiri: 1991-2023 (32 years)
- **Average: ~32 years** (excellent for modern destroyers!)

**Why So Long:**
1. **Quality construction**: Japanese shipbuilding excellence
2. **Good maintenance**: JMSDF maintenance culture (excellent upkeep)
3. **Peacetime**: No combat damage, no wartime stress
4. **Upgrades**: Electronics, communications, sensors upgraded (extended life)
5. **Needed**: JMSDF fleet size ~50 destroyers/frigates (kept Asagiri until Mogami ready)

**Comparison - Destroyer Lifespans:**
- US Oliver Hazard Perry frigates: 25-30 years typical
- British Type 42 destroyers: 25-30 years
- **Asagiri-class: 30-33 years** (exceptional!)
- Modern destroyers typically: 25-30 years active service

**All Retired 2020-2023 - Class Extinct:**

**Retirement Schedule:**
- 2020: Asagiri (DD-151)
- 2021: Yamagiri (DD-152), Setogiri (DD-156)
- 2022: Yugiri (DD-153), Amagiri (DD-154), Hamagiri (DD-155)
- 2023: Sawagiri (DD-157), Umigiri (DD-158)
- **By March 2023**: All 8 retired (class extinct - 0% survival)

**Why All Retired:**
1. **Age**: 30-35 years old (end of service life)
2. **Obsolete design**: Pre-VLS (Murasame/Takanami VLS superior)
3. **Maintenance cost**: Old ships expensive to maintain (diminishing returns)
4. **Replacement ready**: Mogami-class frigates (FFM, 2020+ commissioning)
5. **Fleet modernization**: JMSDF prioritizing modern ships (Aegis, Asahi, Mogami)

**Replaced By:**
- **Mogami-class frigates (FFM)**: 3,900 tons, 30 knots, 16× VLS, cheaper (~$470M vs Asagiri $350M), more automated (crew 90 vs Asagiri 220)
- **22 Mogami planned** (largest modern JMSDF program)
- Better: VLS, modern sensors, multi-mission (ASW, mine warfare, patrol)

**Comparison - 1980s-1990s Japanese Destroyers:**

| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | VLS | Gun | Propulsion | Active |
|-------|-------|------|------|-----|-----|------------|--------|
| Hatsuyuki | 12 | 1982-87 | 3,700 | None | 76mm | COGOG | 0 (all retired) |
| **Asagiri** | **8** | **1988-91** | **4,200** | **None** | **76mm** | **COGOG** | **0 (all retired 2020-23)** |
| Murasame | 9 | 1996-99 | 6,200 | 16→32 | 76mm | COGAG | 9 (all active 2025) |
| Takanami | 5 | 2003-06 | 6,300 | 32 | 127mm | COGAG | 5 (all active 2025) |

**Asagiri Characteristics:**
- **Last pre-VLS** (Murasame 1996+ had VLS)
- **Intermediate size** (4,200 tons vs Murasame 6,200 tons)
- **Bridge design** (between Hatsuyuki and Murasame)
- **All retired** (obsolete, replaced by Mogami)

**Legacy:** Asagiri-class were JMSDF's last pre-VLS destroyers. 8 ships (1988-1991) general-purpose destroyers (ASW, AAW, anti-surface). 4,200 tons, 30 knots, balanced armament. Traditional launchers: Mk 29 Sea Sparrow (8-cell), ASROC octuple launcher, 8× Harpoon SSM. SH-60J helicopter. COGOG propulsion. Bridge between Hatsuyuki and Murasame (evolutionary design). All 8 served 30-35 years (excellent longevity). All retired 2020-2023 (obsolete, replaced by Mogami-class frigates). Class extinct by March 2023 (0% survival). Asagiri-class: Capable workhorses, transitional design, served Japan well through Cold War end and post-Cold War era.

**Historical Significance:** Asagiri-class marked transition in JMSDF destroyer design. 1980s: Cold War still active (Soviet threat), traditional weapons (launchers vs VLS). Designed mid-1980s: Pre-VLS era (Mk 41 VLS new - USS Ticonderoga 1986 first). Asagiri commissioning 1988-1991: Cold War ending (Berlin Wall 1989, Soviet Union dissolved 1991). Served entire post-Cold War era: 1991-2023 (new threats - North Korea, China, piracy). **Last pre-VLS destroyers**: Murasame 1996 introduced VLS (16-cell, upgraded to 32), Kongo Aegis 1993 had 90-cell VLS. Asagiri: Transitional design, proven capabilities but obsolete layout. 30-35 year service lives remarkable: Quality construction, good maintenance, peacetime, needed until Mogami ready. All retired 2020-2023: Clean break (entire class gone), replaced by modern Mogami frigates (better capability, fewer crew, cheaper operation). Comparison: US Oliver Hazard Perry frigates (similar era) mostly retired by 2015 (some sold to allies). British Type 42 destroyers retired 2013. **Asagiri lasted longest** - testament to Japanese quality, maintenance culture. Legacy: Reliable workhorses that bridged Cold War and modern eras, trained generation of JMSDF sailors, proved pre-VLS designs could serve 30+ years. Now: All scrapped/dismantled, replaced by more capable ships. Asagiri-class: Faithful servants, honorable retirement.
