**Why Long Service:**
1. **Excellent construction** (Japanese quality)
2. **Continuous upgrades** (BMD 3.6 → 4.0 → 5.0)
3. **Critical capability** (Aegis, BMD irreplaceable)
4. **Expensive replacement** ($1+ billion each)
5. **Still capable** (modern sensors, weapons)

**Upgrades:**
- Aegis software updates
- BMD capability additions
- New missiles (SM-3 Block IB, later Block IIA)
- Sensors improved
- Combat systems updated
- Basically new ships electronically

**Legacy:** Kongo-class represented revolutionary leap for JMSDF. 4 ships (1993-1998) - Japan's first Aegis destroyers, first Asian Aegis ships. Based on US Arleigh Burke-class via technology transfer. AN/SPY-1D phased array radar (360° coverage, track 100+ targets). 90 VLS cells (SM-2 Standard fleet air defense, SM-3 ballistic missile defense, ASROC ASW). Two 5-inch guns, helicopter capable, 30 knots. Ballistic Missile Defense critical mission - defend Japan from North Korean missile threats. Multiple BMD upgrades (3.6, 4.0, 5.0). All 4 active as of 2025 after 27-32 years service. Expected to serve to 2030s. Established Japan as tier-one naval power with world-class Aegis capability. Evolution: WWII Kongo battleship (1913, 36,000 tons, 9× 14-inch guns) → Modern Kongo DDG (1993, 9,485 tons, 90 VLS, Aegis) = From gunships to missile defense. Same proud name, different era, equal importance.

**Historical Significance:** Kongo-class marked Japan's return to top-tier naval power status after WWII. Commissioned 1993-1998 when Japan faced growing regional threats (North Korea, China). US agreed to Aegis technology transfer - recognition of Japan as critical ally, shared security interests. First Asian Aegis ships (alongside South Korea's later Sejong the Great). Revolutionary capability: Track 100+ targets simultaneously, engage multiple threats, ballistic missile defense. Built in Japan (Mitsubishi, IHI) showing advanced industrial capability - from devastated 1945 to building world's most advanced warships by 1993. BMD mission critical 2000s-present: North Korea launched 100+ ballistic missiles in tests, Kongo-class monitor/ready to intercept. All 4 remain active 2025 (27-32 years service, possibly to 2030s). Proved Japanese maritime technology excellence. Names honor WWII warships (Kongo battleship, Kirishima battleship, Myoko/Chokai heavy cruisers) - historical continuity, proud heritage. From Imperial Japanese Navy (1945 defeat) → Maritime Self-Defense Force (1954) → Aegis destroyers (1993) = Complete transformation. Kongo-class: Symbols of modern Japan - peaceful constitution, defensive posture, world-class capability.
