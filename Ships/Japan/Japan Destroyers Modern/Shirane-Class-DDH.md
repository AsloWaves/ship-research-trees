  - Fleet exercises (continued, adapted to new threats)
- Aging ships (15-20 years old):
  - Maintenance (hull, machinery, systems)
  - Electronics upgrades (radar, communications, computers)

**2000s-2010s (Expanded Operations/Late Service):**
- **Gulf of Aden anti-piracy** (2009+):
  - Shirane/Kurama deployed rotational basis
  - Escort commercial shipping (Somali pirates threat)
  - Helicopter operations critical (reconnaissance, deterrence)

  - Replacement planning (Hyuga-class 2009+, Izumo-class 2015+)

**2015-2017 (Retirement):**
- **March 25, 2015**: **Shirane (DDH-143) retired** (35 years service)
  - Decommissioning ceremony (Yokosuka)
  - Honored service (Cold War, post-Cold War, disaster relief)
  - Scrapped 2015-2016
- **March 22, 2017**: **Kurama (DDH-144) retired** (36 years service)
  - Last Shirane-class
  - Longest-serving JMSDF destroyer (37 years from construction base)
  - Decommissioning ceremony (Sasebo)
  - Scrapped 2017-2018
- **Class extinct by 2017** (0% survival)
- **Replaced by**:
  - Hyuga-class (2× ships, 2009-2011, 19,000 tons, 4 helicopters)
  - Izumo-class (2× ships, 2015-2017, 27,000 tons, 14 aircraft capacity)
  - Modern helicopter destroyers far larger, more capable

**3-Helicopter Capacity - Revolutionary:**

**Why 3 Helicopters:**

1. **Extended search area**: 3 helicopters = 3× coverage area (vs 1-2 helicopters typical)
2. **Continuous operations**: Rotation (1 airborne, 1 ready, 1 maintenance)
3. **Multi-target engagement**: 3 simultaneous submarine targets
4. **Redundancy**: Aircraft mechanical issues don't ground operations (2 remaining)
5. **Flexibility**: ASW, search/rescue, transport, reconnaissance

**SH-60J Seahawk:**
- Mitsubishi-built (license from Sikorsky)
- ASW helicopter (dipping sonar, sonobuoys, torpedoes)
- Specifications:
  - Crew: 4 (pilot, co-pilot, 2 sensor operators)
  - Max speed: 145 knots
  - Range: 380 nm
  - Endurance: 3-4 hours
  - Weapons: 2× Mk 46 torpedoes
  - Sensors: Dipping sonar (active/passive), sonobuoys (passive listening), radar

**Operations:**
- **Typical mission**: Launch helicopter, fly 50-100 nm from ship, dip sonar (listen for submarines), drop sonobuoys (expand search), attack if contact (Mk 46 torpedoes)
- **Coordination**: 3 helicopters = search large area (100+ nm radius), coordinate via datalink
- **ASW task force**: Shirane coordinates multiple ships, each with 1-2 helicopters = 10+ helicopters total (massive search area)

**Comparison - JMSDF Helicopter Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | Helicopters | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| Haruna | 2 | 1973-74 | 5,200 | 2× SH-60J | Predecessors |
| **Shirane** | **2** | **1980-81** | **6,800** | **3× SH-60J** | **First 3-helicopter** |
| Hyuga | 2 | 2009-11 | 19,000 | 4× SH-60K + more | Much larger |
| Izumo | 2 | 2015-17 | 27,000 | 14 aircraft | Largest |

**Shirane: Revolutionary step (2 → 3 helicopters), template for modern DDH**

**Steam Turbine Propulsion - Powerful:**

**Why Steam (1980):**
- Proven technology (reliable, well-understood)
- High power (70,000 shp - fast despite large size)
- Japanese expertise (decades of steam turbine experience)
- Gas turbines (like Hatsuyuki/Asagiri) newer, less proven 1970s

**Shirane's System:**
- Four oil-fired boilers (Kampon type)
- Steam turbines (high-pressure steam drives turbines)
- 70,000 shaft horsepower total
- Two shafts (each driven by turbines)
- **32 knots maximum** (fast for 6,800 tons!)

**Advantages:**
- High power-to-weight (compact for power output)
- Proven reliability (naval use since 1900s)
- Good range (7,000 nm at 20 knots)

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow startup (boilers take hours to reach operating temperature vs gas turbines minutes)
- Maintenance intensive (boilers, turbines, piping complex)
- Crew intensive (boiler operators, engineers)
- Less fuel-efficient than modern systems (COGAG, CODAG)

**Comparison - Later Ships:**
- Murasame (1996): COGAG gas turbines (61,000 shp, 30 knots)
- Hyuga (2009): COGAG gas turbines (100,000 shp, 30 knots)
- Shirane: Steam (70,000 shp, 32 knots) - **actually faster than successors!** (lighter hull, more power-to-weight)

**35-37 Year Service Lives - Exceptional:**

**Longevity:**
- Shirane: 1980-2015 (35 years)
- Kurama: 1981-2017 (36 years, or **37 years** from laid down)
- **Average: 35.5 years** (exceptional for modern warships!)

**Kurama: Longest-Serving JMSDF Destroyer:**
- **37 years** if counting from construction start (1980-2017)
- Survived major collision 2009 (repaired, continued service 7 more years)
- Served entire Cold War (1981-1991) + entire post-Cold War (1991-2017)
- Outlasted: Hatsuyuki (28 years), Asagiri (30-33 years), most contemporaries

**Why So Long:**
1. **Quality construction**: Japanese shipbuilding excellence (IHI, top yard)
2. **Robust design**: Large hull, strong structure (survived Kurama collision)
3. **Excellent maintenance**: JMSDF maintenance culture (preventive, thorough)
4. **Upgrades**: Electronics, sensors, weapons upgraded (extended life)
5. **Needed**: Helicopter destroyers rare (only 2 Shirane, then 2 Hyuga from 2009) - kept until Izumo ready
6. **Peacetime**: No combat damage, no wartime stress

**Comparison - Global Destroyer Lifespans:**
- US Spruance-class: ~30 years
- British Type 42: ~25-30 years
- French Georges Leygues: ~30 years
- **Shirane-class: 35-37 years** (among longest ever!)

**2009 Kurama Collision - Survived:**

**October 27, 2009:**
- **Location**: Kanmon Strait (between Honshu and Kyushu)
- **Weather**: Dense fog (poor visibility)
- **Kurama**: Transiting strait, heading to Sasebo
- **Carina Star**: South Korean container ship (7,401 tons)
- **Collision**: Carina Star crossed Kurama's path, hit port bow
- **Damage**:
  - Kurama: Bow crushed (30 meters damaged), fire started (fuel ignited), 3 sailors injured
  - Carina Star: Minor damage (container ship much larger, tougher bow)
- **Response**: Fire extinguished, Kurama proceeded to Sasebo under own power
- **Repairs**: 6 months (new bow section fabricated, extensive repairs)
- **Return**: Spring 2010, continued service 7 more years!

**Significance:**
- Proved ship's robust construction (survived major collision, 30m bow damage)
- Showed repair capability (complex bow reconstruction)
- JMSDF decision to repair (vs scrap) = valued ship, worth investment

**ASW Command Ship Role:**

**What is ASW Command Ship:**
- **Flagship** for Anti-Submarine Warfare task forces
- **Coordinate** multiple ships' ASW operations
- **Command staff** spaces (admiral/commodore, staff officers)
- **Communications** equipment (tactical data links, secure radio)
- **Tactical displays** (real-time picture of submarine search)

**Shirane's Capabilities:**
- **3 helicopters**: Extend search far beyond ship's sonar range
- **OQS-101 sonar**: Powerful bow sonar (search nearby)
- **OQR-1 towed array**: Long-range passive detection
- **Tactical data links**: Share information with task force ships
- **Command spaces**: Admiral/commodore + staff (plan, coordinate, direct operations)

**Typical Task Force:**
- **Shirane** (flagship): 3 helicopters, command
- **2-3 destroyers**: 1-2 helicopters each, ASROC, torpedoes
- **1-2 frigates**: ASW weapons, additional sensors
- **Total**: 8-12 helicopters, multiple ships, coordinated search (cover hundreds of square miles)

**Tactics:**
- **Barrier patrol**: Ships line up across suspected submarine transit route
- **Area search**: Ships search specific area (lost submarine contact)
- **Convoy escort**: Protect merchant ships from submarines
- **Coordinated attack**: Multiple ships/helicopters converge on submarine contact

**Legacy:** Shirane-class were JMSDF's first 3-helicopter destroyers. 2 ships (1980-1981) revolutionary ASW capability (3× SH-60J helicopters vs predecessors' 2). 6,800 tons (largest Japanese destroyers when built). ASW command ships (coordinate multi-ship operations). 32 knots (steam turbines, 70,000 shp). Balanced armament (2× 5-inch, Mk 29, Harpoon, ASROC). Served 35-37 years (exceptional longevity). Kurama survived major collision 2009 (repaired, 7 more years service). Both retired 2015-2017 (replaced by Hyuga/Izumo-class, larger, more capable). Shirane-class: Bridge between Haruna and modern helicopter destroyers, pioneered 3-helicopter operations, trained generation of helicopter crews, faithful Cold War warriors.

**Historical Significance:** Shirane-class marked evolution in JMSDF helicopter destroyer concept. 1970s: Haruna-class (2 ships, 5,200 tons, 2 helicopters) established DDH category. 1980s: Shirane-class escalation (6,800 tons, **3 helicopters** - 50% increase in aviation capability). Why: Soviet submarine threat growing (larger Pacific Fleet, quieter submarines, longer patrols). Japanese response: More helicopters (extend search area, continuous operations). Design philosophy: **Aviation-centric destroyer** (40% of hull aviation facilities vs typical destroyers 15-20%). Influenced global trends: US developing helicopter-capable destroyers, UK Type 23 frigates (helicopter emphasis), France Georges Leygues (ASW helicopter focus). 35-37 year service lives remarkable: Quality construction, needed capability (only 2 Shirane until Hyuga 2009), excellent maintenance. **Kurama 37 years = longest-serving JMSDF destroyer!** Survived major collision 2009 (repaired, 7 more years - testament to robust construction). Both retired 2015-2017: Replaced by much larger ships (Hyuga 19,000 tons, 4 helicopters; Izumo 27,000 tons, 14 aircraft). Evolution: Haruna 2 helicopters (1973) → Shirane 3 helicopters (1980) → Hyuga 4 helicopters (2009) → Izumo 14 aircraft (2015) = continuous expansion ASW aviation capability. Legacy: Pioneered 3-helicopter operations, proved concept viable, trained generation of helicopter crews, bridged Cold War and modern eras. Shirane-class: Unsung heroes of JMSDF, faithful ASW warriors for 35+ years.
