**Largest Since WWII:**

**Size Comparison:**

**Izumo-Class (2015):**
- 27,000 tons full
- 814 ft long
- 125 ft beam (flight deck)

**WWII Japanese Carriers:**
- Akagi: 42,750 tons, 855 ft
- Kaga (original): 42,800 tons, 812 ft
- Soryu: 18,800 tons, 746 ft
- **Izumo larger than Soryu!**

**Post-WWII:**
- No carriers 1945-2015 (70 years!)
- Hyuga-class DDH: 19,000 tons (2009)
- **Izumo-class: 27,000 tons (largest ever JMSDF)**

**Symbolic:**
- Japan builds "destroyers" not "carriers" (constitutional)
- But Izumo-class functionally light carriers
- Name honors WWII carrier Kaga (sunk Midway 1942)
- Modern Kaga operates F-35B (like WWII Kaga operated Zeros)
- Historical continuity with different mission (defensive)

**Constitutional Issues:**

**Article 9 Debate:**
- Japanese Constitution Article 9 (1947):
  - "Renounce war as sovereign right"
  - "Never maintain land, sea, air forces"
  - Interpreted to allow self-defense forces

**"Offensive" vs "Defensive":**
- Traditional view: Aircraft carriers = offensive weapons
- Problem: Izumo-class look like carriers, operate F-35B
- Solution: Call them "multi-purpose destroyers"
  - Primary: ASW, disaster relief (defensive)
  - Secondary: Air defense with F-35B (defensive)
  - NOT power projection (offensive)

**Political Balance:**
- Growing threats (China, North Korea)
- Japan needs capability
- But constitutional constraints
- Compromise: "Destroyers" that happen to operate jets
- International community understands (tacit acceptance)

**Comparison - Modern Light Carriers:**
| Ship | Nation | Commissioned | Tons | Length | Aircraft | Type |
|------|--------|--------------|------|--------|----------|------|
| **Izumo** | **Japan** | **2015** | **27,000** | **814 ft** | **12 F-35B + helos** | **DDH** |
| Kaga | Japan | 2017 | 27,000 | 814 ft | 12 F-35B + helos | DDH |
| Queen Elizabeth | UK | 2017 | 65,000 | 920 ft | 40 F-35B | CVF |
| Cavour | Italy | 2009 | 27,000 | 801 ft | 12 F-35B | CVH |
| Trieste | Italy | 2022 | 33,000 | 794 ft | 10-15 F-35B | LHD |
| America | USA | 2014 | 45,000 | 844 ft | 20 F-35B | LHA |

**Izumo similar size to Cavour, operates similar air wing**

**Names Honor History:**

**Izumo:**
- Original: Izumo-class protected cruiser (1900-1945)
- Sino-Japanese War, Russo-Japanese War, WWI, WWII
- Survived WWII, surrendered 1945
- Scrapped 1947
- Long service, honorable history

**Kaga:**
- Original: Tosa-class battleship → converted to carrier
- Kaga-class carrier (1928-1942, lead ship)
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 7, 1941)
- **Sunk June 4, 1942** - Battle of Midway
  - Dive bomber hits from USS Enterprise
  - Hangar fires, massive explosions
  - Scuttled June 4, 1942
  - 811 killed

**Irony:**
- WWII Kaga sunk by US carrier aircraft (Midway)
- Modern Kaga operates US-designed F-35B
- Allies now, not enemies
- Same proud name, peaceful mission

**Multi-Role Capability:**

**Primary Missions:**

1. **Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW):**
   - 14 SH-60K helicopters (ASW config)
   - OQQ-23 hull sonar
   - Hunt Chinese/North Korean submarines
   - Protect sea lanes

2. **Air Defense:**
   - 12 F-35B fighters
   - Air superiority, fleet defense
   - Counter Chinese fighters
   - Defend against missiles

3. **Amphibious Support:**
   - Transport helicopters (MCH-101)
   - Support JGSDF (army) operations
   - Island defense
   - Command ship

4. **Disaster Relief:**
   - Hospital facilities
   - Helicopter base
   - Supply transport
   - Evacuation
   - Earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons

5. **Command and Control:**
   - Flag facilities
   - Communications
   - Fleet coordination
   - Amphibious operations command

**Flexibility:**
- Change air wing for mission
- All ASW: 14 helicopters
- Air defense: 12 F-35B + 6 helos
- Amphibious: Transport helos + F-35B
- Disaster: Medical helos, supplies

**Not "Supercarriers":**

**Limitations vs US Carriers:**

**Size:**
- Nimitz/Ford: 100,000 tons
- Izumo: 27,000 tons
- **1/4 the size**

**Aircraft:**
- Nimitz: 60-70 aircraft (F/A-18, E-2D, etc.)
- Izumo: 12 F-35B max
- **1/5 the aircraft**

**Capability:**
- US carriers: Power projection, strike warfare, sustained operations
- Izumo: Regional defense, limited operations, defensive

**Role:**
- US: Global power projection
- Japan: Home waters defense, regional security
- Different missions, different capabilities

**But Still Powerful:**
- 12 F-35B = significant capability
- Fifth-generation stealth
- More capable than most nations' air forces
- Defend sea lanes, deter aggression
- Adequate for Japan's defensive needs

**Future (2025+):**

**Operational Development:**
- Build F-35B pilot/maintainer cadre
- Develop carrier operations doctrine
- Train with US Navy/USMC
- Full operational capability late 2020s

**Potential Upgrades:**
- More F-35B (if needed)
- Enhanced air defenses
- Improved sensors
- Network improvements

**Force Structure:**
- 2 Izumo-class operational
- Rotate deployments (one always ready)
- Combine with Aegis destroyers (integrated task force)
- Credible deterrent vs China

**Expected Service:**
- Commissioned 2015, 2017
- Expected: 40+ years service
- Through 2050s-2060s
- Multiple refits
- Technology upgrades
- Critical capability for decades

**Legacy:** Izumo-class represent Japan's return to carrier aviation after 73 years (1945-2018). 2 ships (2015, 2017) - largest Japanese warships since WWII (27,000 tons, 814 ft). Originally helicopter destroyers (14 SH-60K). Modified 2020-2024 for F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters - now light aircraft carriers (12 F-35B + helicopters). Constitutional compromise: "Multi-purpose destroyers" not "carriers" (defensive posture). Names honor history: Izumo (protected cruiser 1900-1945), Kaga (carrier 1928-1942, sunk Midway). Multi-role: ASW, air defense, amphibious support, disaster relief. Both active as of 2025. F-35B capability transformative - Japan can now defend sea lanes, deter aggression with fifth-generation fighters at sea. Expected service through 2050s-2060s. Evolution: WWII Kaga (42,800 tons, 90 aircraft, sunk Midway) → Modern Kaga (27,000 tons, 12 F-35B, defensive mission). Different era, same dedication to Japan's security.

**Historical Significance:** Izumo-class mark Japan's most dramatic naval capability expansion since WWII. Commissioned 2015-2017 when regional threats growing (China 300-ship navy, island disputes, North Korea). Largest Japanese warships since 1945 - 27,000 tons comparable to WWII carriers. Originally helicopter destroyers (constitutional constraints), modified 2020s for F-35B (game changer). First Japanese fixed-wing carrier capability since 1945 - 73-year gap. Political achievement: Balance defensive posture (Article 9) with real capability needs. Ships called "destroyers" but functionally light carriers. International community accepts (understand Japan's challenges). Names powerful symbolism: Modern Kaga operates F-35B from deck, WWII Kaga operated Zeros from deck - both defend Japan, different eras. From 1945 defeat (lost all carriers) to 2015 Izumo/Kaga (new carriers) = complete recovery. Show modern Japan: Advanced technology, peaceful constitution, world-class capability, defensive mission. Izumo-class will defend Japan 40+ years (to 2050s-2060s). Critical platforms for JMSDF. Pride of fleet.
