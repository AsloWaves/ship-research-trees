- **Launched:** 2020+ (ongoing)
- **Commissioned:** 2022+ (ongoing program)
- **Cost:** ~$470 million each (2020s dollars - very economical!)
- **Build rate:** ~2-3 ships per year

**Service History:**

**2022-2023 (Initial Service):**
- Mogami commissioned March 2022 (first FFM)
- Revolutionary concept: Multi-mission frigate
- Compact, cost-effective
- Kumano, Noshiro commissioned 2022-2023
- Fleet integration
- Multi-role training (ASW, mine warfare, surface combat)

**2024-2025 (Program Expansion):**
- Mikuma, Yahagi, Agano commissioned 2024
- 6 ships active by end 2024
- More under construction
- Replacing older ships:
  - Abukuma-class destroyer escorts (6 ships, 1989-1993, aging)
  - Minesweeper classes (various, aging)
- Fleet rationalization (fewer ship types, simpler logistics)

**2025+ (Ongoing):**
- Continued construction (FFM-7 through FFM-22)
- Eventually 22 ships total (largest modern Japanese program!)
- Will form backbone of JMSDF for routine missions
- Free up destroyers for high-threat operations
- Cost-effective fleet expansion

**$470 Million - Very Economical:**

**Cost Comparison:**
- Aegis destroyer: $1.5-1.7 billion
- Asahi/Akizuki destroyer: $750-800 million
- **Mogami frigate: $470 million** (cheapest modern Japanese combatant!)

**Why So Cheap:**
1. **Smaller:** 5,500 tons vs 6,800-10,250 tons destroyers
2. **Simpler systems:** No Aegis, no FCS-3A (4-array), basic combat system
3. **Automation:** Crew 90 (less manning costs)
4. **Commercial standards:** Some commercial-grade systems vs military-spec
5. **Mass production:** 22 ships = economies of scale

**Value:**
- **3 Mogami cost ~1 Aegis destroyer**
- More ships for same budget
- Presence in more places
- Low-end threats don't need Aegis

**Multi-Mission Concept:**

**Replaces TWO Ship Types:**

**Before Mogami:**
- **Destroyer escorts:** 6 Abukuma-class (ASW, patrol)
- **Minesweepers:** ~20-25 ships (various classes, dedicated mine warfare)
- **Total: ~30 ships** (different types, complex logistics)

**After Mogami:**
- **22 Mogami-class:** Do BOTH missions (ASW AND mine warfare)
- **Result: Fewer hulls, same capability**

**Multi-Role Capability:**
1. **Anti-Submarine Warfare:** OQQ-25 sonar, towed array, helicopter, ASROC
2. **Mine Countermeasures:** Mine detection sonar, USVs (unmanned vehicles), mine-laying
3. **Anti-Surface:** Type 17 SSM, 5-inch gun, torpedoes
4. **Air Defense:** ESSM (64 missiles), SeaRAM (21 missiles)
5. **Patrol:** Long range (5,000 nm), good sensors, helicopter

**Flexibility:**
- Reconfigure for mission (emphasize ASW or mine warfare as needed)
- One ship type = simpler training, spare parts, maintenance

**Unmanned Systems Integration:**

**Revolutionary for JMSDF:**
- Mogami-class designed to operate unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
- **Mine hunting:** USVs deployed from frigate, remote-controlled
  - Sonar scan for mines
  - Identify mine types
  - Mark locations
  - Return to mother ship
- **Advantages:** Keep crew safe (no manned boats in minefield)

**Future Expansion:**
- Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - reconnaissance, targeting
- Possibly unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) - mine disposal
- Mogami platform for testing new unmanned systems

**CODLAD Propulsion:**

**Combined Diesel eLectric And Diesel:**
- 4× diesel engines total
- **Electric drive:** 2 engines → generators → electric motors (cruise)
- **Direct drive:** 2 engines → shafts directly (sprint)
- 2 shafts

**Modes:**
- **Cruise (slow):** Electric drive only (quiet, fuel-efficient, good for ASW)
- **Transit (medium):** Diesel direct drive
- **Sprint (fast):** All engines (electric + direct = 30 knots max)

**Advantages:**
1. **Fuel economy:** Electric drive very efficient at low speeds
2. **Quieter:** Electric motors quieter than diesels (ASW benefit)
3. **Flexibility:** Multiple power modes
4. **Reliability:** Redundancy (4 engines, can lose some and continue)

**90 Crew - Highly Automated:**

**Very Small for Size:**
- 5,500 tons full displacement
- Crew: 90 (tiny!)
- Comparison: WWII destroyers 2,000 tons had 250+ crew

**2020s Automation:**
- Machinery monitoring (automated systems)
- Combat system (AI-assisted)
- Unmanned systems (reduce boat crews needed)
- Modern damage control (sensors, automation)
- Integrated bridge systems

**Benefits:**
- **Low operating costs:** Fewer sailors to pay
- **Better quality of life:** More space per person
- **Smaller footprint:** Less support needed

**22 Ships Planned - Largest Program:**

**Massive Production:**
- 22 frigates planned (most ships of any modern Japanese class!)
- Compare: Aegis (8 total), Akizuki (4), Asahi (2)
- **Mogami: More than all Aegis+Akizuki+Asahi combined**

**Why So Many:**
1. **Replace multiple ship types:** Destroyer escorts + minesweepers (~30 ships → 22 frigates)
2. **Fleet presence:** Japan needs ships in many places (patrol, escort, mine warfare)
3. **Cost-effective:** Can afford 22 at $470M each (vs 7-8 Aegis at $1.7B each)
4. **Routine missions:** Most missions don't need Aegis, Mogami adequate

**Force Structure:**
- **High:** 8 Aegis (BMD, high-threat, expensive)
- **Medium:** Conventional destroyers (Akizuki, Asahi, Murasame, etc.)
- **Low:** 22 Mogami (routine patrol, mine warfare, economical)
- **Balanced fleet:** Ships for every mission level

**Names Honor WWII Cruisers:**

**All Named for WWII Cruisers:**
- **Mogami:** Heavy cruiser (1935-1944, Mogami-class lead, sunk Battle of Leyte Gulf)
- **Kumano:** Heavy cruiser (Mogami-class, 1937-1944, sunk Philippines)
- **Mikuma:** Heavy cruiser (Mogami-class, 1935-1942, sunk Battle of Midway)
- **Noshiro:** Light cruiser (Agano-class, 1943-1944, sunk Philippines)
- **Yahagi:** Light cruiser (Agano-class, 1943-1945, escorted Yamato's final mission, sunk April 7, 1945)
- **Agano:** Light cruiser (Agano-class lead, 1942-1944)

**Historical Continuity:**
- WWII cruisers: Large, powerful, lost in battle
- Modern Mogami frigates: Compact, economical, peaceful mission
- Names preserved, roles different
- Pride in heritage

**Legacy:** Mogami-class represent JMSDF's cost-effective fleet expansion strategy. 22 ships planned (ongoing, 12+ by 2025) - largest modern Japanese program. Compact multi-mission frigates (5,500 tons, $470M) replace TWO ship types: Destroyer escorts AND minesweepers. Multi-role: ASW, mine warfare, patrol, surface combat, air defense. Unmanned systems integration (USVs for mine hunting). Advanced automation (crew 90). CODLAD hybrid propulsion (efficient, quiet). 16 VLS (64 ESSM), 5-inch gun, 8× Type 17 SSM, SeaRAM, advanced sonar. All active as of 2025. Expected through 2050s-2060s. Names honor WWII cruisers (Mogami, Kumano, Mikuma, Yahagi, etc.). Mogami-class: Future JMSDF backbone, economical excellence, smart force structure.

**Historical Significance:** Mogami-class mark JMSDF's transition to cost-effective mass production. Cannot afford 40+ Aegis destroyers ($1.7B each = $68+ billion!). Solution: 22 Mogami frigates ($470M each = $10.3 billion total - 85% cheaper!). Smart economics: High-low-lowest mix. High: 8 Aegis (BMD, critical). Low: Destroyers (general purpose). Lowest: 22 Mogami (routine missions). Mogami handle 80% of fleet needs at 30% the cost. Multi-mission concept: One ship type replaces destroyer escorts + minesweepers (fleet rationalization, simpler logistics). Unmanned systems: USVs for mine warfare (future of naval operations, keep crews safe). 90 crew: Automation advances from WWII 250+ crew on 2,000-ton destroyers to modern 90 crew on 5,500-ton frigates. Ongoing program: 12 active 2025, 22 total by early 2030s - sustained production supports industrial base, employment. Names honor WWII cruisers lost in battle (Mogami, Mikuma at Midway/Leyte; Yahagi escorted Yamato's final mission). Modern Mogami: Different mission (peaceful patrol, mine warfare, ASW) but same dedication. Expected service 2022-2060s. Mogami-class: Smart solution to modern fleet challenges.
