**AA Specialists** - Akizuki-class were specialized anti-aircraft destroyers, first IJN destroyers designed primarily for fleet air defense. 12 ships completed 1942-1944 (plus 16 Fuyutsuki sub-class 1944-1945). Eight dual-purpose 100mm guns in four twin turrets. Reduced torpedoes (4 vs 8) for AA focus. Most sunk 1943-1945 by submarines and air attack.

**Key Specs:** 2,701/3,759 tons | 440ft | 33 kn | 8× 100mm DP + 40+ 25mm AA + 4× 610mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 12 ships (main class)

**Innovation:** First IJN specialized AA destroyers. Eight dual-purpose 100mm/65 guns - most DP firepower in IJN destroyer. High-angle mounts (90° elevation) for AA. Reduced torpedo armament (one quad mount vs two quads on Kagero) to accommodate AA. Larger displacement (2,701 tons) for AA systems. Radar-equipped (Type 21, Type 13). Designed to screen carriers and battleships from air attack. Response to increasing Allied air superiority.

**Design:** Four twin 100mm DP turrets (two forward superfiring, two aft superfiring). One quad 24-inch torpedo launcher amidships. Heavy light AA (40+ 25mm by 1944). Radar systems. Larger than fleet destroyers for AA capability. High speed maintained (33 knots). Good range (8,000 nm). Depth charges for ASW. Fire control for AA engagements. Designed as carrier escorts and fleet air defense.

**Ships (Original Akizuki-class - 12 built):**
1. **Akizuki** - Sunk October 26, 1944 (Battle of Cape Engano), 161 killed
2. **Teruzuki** - Sunk December 12, 1942 (submarine USS Meade), 148 killed

- "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot" - shot down some US aircraft
- Most survived battle

**Battle of Cape Engano (October 25, 1944) - Akizuki, Natsuzuki:**
*Last carrier battle*
- Escorted carrier force (Northern Force decoys)
- Heavy air attacks from US Task Force 38
- **Akizuki:** Hit by bombs and torpedoes, sank (161 killed)

- Both escorted Yamato to Okinawa
- **April 7:** Attacked by 400+ US carrier aircraft
- **Fuyutsuki:** Bomb damage, survived, rescued Yamato survivors
- **Suzutsuki:** Bow blown off by aerial torpedo, survived, returned to Japan

**Submarine Losses:**
- **8 of 12** original Akizuki-class sunk by submarines
- Most effective Allied counter to destroyers
- Shows vulnerability despite AA focus
- Losses: Teruzuki, Hatsuzuki, Wakatsuki, Shimotsuki, Yoizuki, Harutsuki, Michitsuki (USS Hake sank Harutsuki and Michitsuki same day)

**100mm/65 Type 98 Gun Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 100mm (3.9 inches)
- **Barrel length:** 6.5 meters (21.3 feet)
- **Shell weight:** HE: 13 kg (28.7 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 1,000 m/s (3,281 ft/s)
- **Maximum range:** 19,000 meters (20,780 yards) surface
- **Maximum altitude:** 10,000 meters (33,000 feet) AA
- **Rate of fire:** 15-19 rounds per minute
- **Elevation:** -10° to +90° (full AA capability)

- High velocity (1,000 m/s) - excellent for AA
- Radar-directed fire control
- Effective against dive bombers and torpedo bombers
- Shot down multiple US aircraft in battles
- But insufficient against 1944-1945 US air superiority

**Comparison - AA Destroyers:**
| Class | Nation | Displacement | Main Guns | AA Focus | Torpedoes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Akizuki** | **Japan** | **2,701** | **8× 100mm DP** | **Primary** | **4× 24"** |
| Fletcher | USA | 2,050 | 5× 5" DP | Secondary | 10× 21" |
| Atlanta | USA | 6,000 | 16× 5" DP | Primary | 8× 21" |
| Dido | UK | 5,600 | 10× 5.25" DP | Primary | 6× 21" |

**Wartime Modifications:**
- **AA increased:** From 4× to 40+ 25mm guns (topweight problem)
- **Radar added:** Type 21 surface search, Type 13 air search
- **Depth charges increased:** Up to 72 for ASW
- **Some ships:** Degaussing equipment added
- **Late war:** Some 25mm replaced with 13mm MGs (weight reduction)

**Loss Statistics:**
- **12 original Akizuki-class:**
  - **Sunk by submarine:** 8 ships (67%)
  - **Sunk by surface action:** 1 ship (8%)
  - **Sunk by air attack:** 2 ships (17%)
  - **Survived:** 2 ships (17%)
- **Survival rate:** 16.7% (2 of 12)

**Fuyutsuki Sub-Class:**
- 16 additional ships built 1944-1945
- Slightly modified design
- Same armament and performance
- Most completed late war or after
- Several survived to surrender

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Carrier escort:** Screen carriers from air attack
- **Battleship escort:** AA defense for capital ships
- **Fleet air defense:** Protect task forces
- **Tokyo Express:** Some used for supply runs (misuse of AA specialists)
- **ASW:** Depth charge attacks on submarines

**Survivors:**
- **Suzutsuki:**
  - Bow blown off April 7, 1945 (Operation Ten-Go)
  - Repaired with temporary bow
  - Surrendered August 1945
  - Scrapped 1948
- **Fuyutsuki:**
  - Survived Operation Ten-Go
  - Surrendered intact
  - Ceded to Republic of China 1947 as **Fen Yang**
  - Served until 1963, scrapped 1969

**Design Limitations:**
- AA focus didn't prevent submarine losses
- Reduced torpedoes limited surface combat
- Topweight from AA guns affected stability
- Larger size made better submarine targets
- Insufficient numbers to affect air battles
- Technology good but tactics/training inadequate against 1944-1945 US forces

**Legacy:** Akizuki-class represented IJN adaptation to air warfare - specialized AA destroyers. Most heavily armed AA destroyers in IJN. Eight DP guns effective but insufficient against overwhelming US air power. Heavy submarine losses (67%) showed vulnerability despite AA focus - submarines, not aircraft, were greatest threat to destroyers. Two survivors of original 12 showed 83% loss rate. Fuyutsuki sub-class had better survival (several survived). Design sound but arrived too late and too few. Names: Months and moon phases in Japanese calendar.

**Historical Significance:** Akizuki-class showed IJN recognized air threat and adapted designs. First specialized AA destroyers demonstrated shift from surface-centric to air-defense doctrine. But too few, too late - only 12 completed before late war simplifications. Heavy losses to submarines ironic - designed to counter aircraft but killed by submarines. Two survivors (Suzutsuki, Fuyutsuki) witnessed IJN's end. Suzutsuki's Operation Ten-Go survival (bow blown off) showed ship toughness despite unarmored design. Fuyutsuki's long service with ROC Navy (1947-1969) extended class legacy. Represented last sophisticated destroyer design before wartime desperation forced simpler ships.
