**Revolutionary Design** - Fubuki-class "Special Type" destroyers revolutionized destroyer design worldwide. 24 ships built 1928-1932. First with twin enclosed gun turrets. Nine 24-inch torpedoes. 38 knots. Outgunned and out-torpedoed all contemporary destroyers. Served throughout Pacific War. 20 sunk in action.

**Key Specs:** 1,750/2,090 tons | 388ft | 38 kn | 6× 127mm (twin turrets) + 9× 610mm torpedoes | 24 ships

**Innovation:** Revolutionary "Special Type" (Tokugata) design that shocked Western navies. First destroyers with fully enclosed twin gun turrets. Nine torpedo tubes in three triple mounts. Larger and more powerful than any contemporary destroyers. High freeboard for good seakeeping. Dual-purpose main guns (surface and AA capable). Set new standard for destroyer design worldwide. Influenced US Fletcher-class and all subsequent destroyers.

**Design:** Six 5-inch guns in three twin enclosed turrets (two forward superfiring, one aft). Nine 24-inch torpedo tubes (three triple launchers). High freeboard. Enclosed bridge. Good sea-keeping in Pacific conditions. Later fitted with Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedoes (40 km range). Superior to all Western destroyers when introduced.

**Sub-Classes:**
1. **Fubuki-class** (Fubuki group): 10 ships (1928-1929)
   - Original design
   - Straight stem, lower bridge
2. **Fubuki-class** (Ayanami group): 10 ships (1929-1930)
   - Modified bridge structure
   - Improved fire control
3. **Akatsuki-class** (officially separate, but Fubuki variant): 4 ships (1932)
   - Further modifications
   - Improved anti-aircraft capability

**Notable Ships:**
- **Fubuki** - Name ship, sunk October 11, 1942 (Battle of Cape Esperance)
- **Shirayuki** - Sunk March 3, 1943 (Bismarck Sea)
- **Hatsuyuki** - Sunk July 17, 1943 (Kolombangara)
- **Akatsuki** - Sunk November 13, 1942 (Naval Battle of Guadalcanal) - famous searchlight incident
- **Hibiki** - Survived war, transferred to USSR 1947, scrapped 1963
- **Ushio** - Survived war, scrapped 1948
- **Uranami** - Sunk October 26, 1944 (Battle off Samar)
- **Ayanami** - Sunk November 15, 1942 (Naval Battle of Guadalcanal)

**Service:**
- **1928-1941:** Training, China operations (1937-1938), pre-war operations
- **1941-1942:** Pearl Harbor operation, East Indies invasion, Solomon Islands
- **1942-1943:** Guadalcanal campaign - Tokyo Express runs, surface battles
  - Battle of Cape Esperance (October 1942): Fubuki sunk
  - Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (November 1942): Akatsuki, Ayanami sunk
- **1943-1944:** Central Pacific, attrition in battles and air attacks
- **1944-1945:** Philippines campaign, convoy escorts, kaiten carrier conversions

**Battle Record:**
- Most active in Guadalcanal campaign (1942-1943)
- Tokyo Express (Rat Run) missions - high-speed supply runs
- Surface night actions - superior to US destroyers early war
- **Akatsuki's last battle** (November 13, 1942): Illuminated USS Atlanta with searchlight, destroyed by multiple US ships (famous incident)
- Attrition through air attacks, surface combat, submarines

**127mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 127mm (5 inches)
- **Barrel length:** 6.35 meters (20.8 feet)
- **Shell weight:** 23 kg (50.7 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 910 m/s (2,986 ft/s)
- **Maximum range:** 18,380 meters (20,100 yards / 11.4 miles)
- **Rate of fire:** 10 rounds per minute
- **Elevation:** -7° to +75° (dual-purpose)

**Torpedo Armament:**
- **Type 90 torpedo** initially (610mm / 24-inch)
- **Type 93 "Long Lance"** fitted later:
  - Range: 40,000 meters (43,745 yards / 24.8 miles) at 36 knots
  - Warhead: 490 kg (1,080 lbs)
  - Oxygen-fueled, wakeless
  - Most advanced torpedo in WWII
- **Three triple launchers** (9 tubes) - later reduced to two triple (6 tubes) for more AA

**Losses:**
- **20 of 24 sunk** (83% loss rate)
- **2 survived war:** Hibiki (to USSR), Ushio (scrapped)
- **2 scrapped incomplete** (war cancellations)
- Highest losses in Guadalcanal campaign (1942-1943)
- Air attacks primary cause late war

**Modernization (1942-1944 Survivors):**
- Reduced torpedo armament (9 to 6 tubes)
- Greatly increased AA (up to 28× 25mm guns)
- Radar fitted (Type 22 surface search)
- Depth charge capacity doubled
- Some converted to kaiten (suicide torpedo) carriers

**Legacy:** Most influential destroyer design of interwar period. Shocked Western navies when capabilities revealed. Forced US and UK to design larger, more heavily armed destroyers. Superior night-fighting capability demonstrated at Guadalcanal. Type 93 torpedoes made them deadly in surface combat. Heavy losses showed vulnerability to air power and radar-equipped opponents. Survivors converted to various roles (AA, kaiten carriers) showed desperation of late-war IJN. Hibiki's transfer to USSR and long service (to 1963 as "Verniy") showed robust design.

**International Impact:**
- **US response:** Fletcher-class (2,050 tons, 5× 5-inch, 10× 21-inch torpedoes)
- **UK response:** Tribal-class (1,870 tons, 8× 4.7-inch)
- **Changed destroyer warfare:** Larger ships, heavier armament became standard
- **Proved concept:** Destroyer flotillas as offensive weapons, not just escorts

**Historical Significance:** Fubuki-class represented Japan's determination to build qualitatively superior warships despite treaty restrictions. Demonstrated that destroyers could be powerful offensive weapons. Dominated destroyer actions early WWII. Guadalcanal campaign showed both their effectiveness (Tokyo Express) and vulnerability (repeated losses). Name "Fubuki" means "blizzard" - fitting for revolutionary design that swept away previous destroyer concepts.
