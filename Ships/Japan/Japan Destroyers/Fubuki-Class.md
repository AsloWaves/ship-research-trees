**Revolutionary "Special Type"** - Fubuki-class were revolutionary destroyers that changed naval warfare worldwide. 24 ships commissioned 1928-1932. First destroyers with enclosed gun turrets (protected crews). 6× 127mm guns in 3 twin turrets. 9× 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes (most powerful torpedo armament afloat). 38 knots (fastest destroyers when built). 2,090 tons (large for era). Influenced all subsequent destroyer designs globally (British Tribal, US Fletcher copied features). All 24 fought entire WWII. 21 lost (87.5% casualty rate - highest of any major class). 3 survived: Ushio, Hibiki (USSR Vernyi), Inazuma. Famous incidents: Amagiri rammed PT-109 (JFK's boat, 1943), Ikazuchi rescued 422 Allied sailors (honorable action, 1942). Fubuki-class: Game-changers that defined modern destroyers.

**Key Specs:** 1,750/2,090 tons | 388ft | 38 kn | 6× 127mm (enclosed) | 9× 24-inch torpedoes | 24 ships | 21 lost

**Innovation:** Revolutionary design that changed destroyer warfare forever (1928-1932). **Enclosed gun turrets** - first destroyers worldwide with fully enclosed turrets (previous: open mounts exposed crews to weather/shrapnel). Protected gunners, better seakeeping, all-weather capability. Three twin 127mm turrets: 2 forward, 1 aft (superfiring arrangement). **9× 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes** - three triple mounts (centerline, wing mounts). Type 90 torpedoes: 610mm oxygen-fueled, 11,000-yard range, 500+ lb warhead (deadliest torpedoes in world). More torpedoes than any destroyer afloat. **38 knots** - fastest destroyers when commissioned (50,000 shp, 2 shafts). High-pressure boilers, efficient turbines. **Large size** - 2,090 tons full (vs 1,500 tons typical destroyers). Better seakeeping, endurance, habitability. **Modern fire control** - Type 94 director, rangefinders (advanced for 1920s). **Impact on naval warfare**: British studied Fubuki, built Tribal-class (enclosed turrets copied). US Fletcher-class influenced by Special Type. Germany, France, Italy all copied features. **Fubuki-class defined modern destroyers** - enclosed turrets, heavy torpedo armament, high speed, good seakeeping became standard worldwide.

**Design:** Large destroyer hull (388 ft, 2,090 tons). Three twin 127mm Type 3 gun turrets: #1 and #2 forward (superfiring - #2 elevated), #3 aft. **Enclosed turrets** - armored shields, weatherproof (revolutionary!). Nine 24-inch torpedo tubes: Triple mount centerline, two wing mounts (port/starboard). Type 90 Long Lance torpedoes (oxygen-fueled, 11,000 yards, deadly). Two funnels (raked, sleek design). Type 94 fire control director atop bridge. Optical rangefinders. 18 depth charges (ASW capability). Mine rails (could lay mines). High-pressure oil-fired boilers (4× Kampon boilers). Steam turbines (50,000 shp total). Two shafts. 38 knots max speed. 5,000 nm range at 14 knots (good endurance). Crew 197 (comfortable for 2,000-ton ship vs cramped earlier destroyers). Excellent seakeeping (large hull, flared bow). Beautiful lines (sleek, modern, intimidating).

**PT-109 Incident (August 2, 1943):**

**Most Famous Fubuki-class Action:**

**Setup:**
- Location: Blackett Strait, Solomon Islands
- Date: Night of August 2-3, 1943
- Japanese: Destroyer force including **Amagiri**
- US: PT boats (Patrol Torpedo boats - small, fast)
- Mission: Japanese resupplying troops ("Tokyo Express" runs)

**The Collision:**
- PT-109 commanded by Lt. John F. Kennedy (future 35th US President)
- PT-109 patrolling to intercept Japanese destroyers
- **2:00 AM**: Amagiri spotted PT-109 (small target, dark night)
- **Amagiri charged at full speed** (38 knots)
- PT-109 tried to evade, engines failed
- **Amagiri rammed PT-109** (388-ft destroyer vs 80-ft PT boat)
- PT-109 **cut in half** by destroyer's bow
- Aft section sank immediately (2 crew killed)
- Forward section stayed afloat (11 survivors including JFK)

**Aftermath:**
- Amagiri continued mission (minor damage to bow)
- JFK and survivors clung to wreckage, swam to island (3 miles)
- JFK towed injured crew member (life jacket strap in teeth)
- Survived on island 6 days
- Rescued by native islanders, Australian coastwatcher
- **JFK became war hero** (medals, fame, political career)
- Story became legend: "How PT-109 was rammed and sunk"
- Helped JFK win presidency 1960 (war hero image)

**Amagiri's Fate:**
- Survived ramming
- Continued fighting Solomons
- April 23, 1944: Ran aground Makassar Strait
- Destroyed to prevent capture
- Crew survived, repatriated

**Historical Irony:**
- Japanese destroyer created American President
- Amagiri crew never knew they'd rammed future leader of US
- JFK later said: "It was involuntary. They sank my boat."

**British Rescue (March 2, 1942):**

**Honorable Action by Ikazuchi:**

**Setup:**
- Battle of Java Sea (February 27, 1942) - Japanese victory
- British cruisers HMS Exeter, HMS Encounter fleeing
- Caught by Japanese cruisers March 1, 1942
- Both British cruisers sunk
- **~800 British sailors in water** (sharks, exhaustion, death)

**The Rescue:**
- March 2, 1942: Destroyer **Ikazuchi** found survivors
- Commander: Lt. Cdr. Shunsaku Kudo
- **Decision: Rescue enemy sailors** (risky - submarines, aircraft nearby)
- Ikazuchi stopped, lowered lines/nets
- **Rescued 422 British sailors** (376 from Exeter, 46 from Encounter)
- Destroyer designed for 197 crew, now 619 people aboard! (3× capacity)
- Crowded: Men everywhere (decks, compartments, passageways)

**Treatment:**
- Fed survivors (shared Japanese rations)
- Treated wounded (medical care)
- Gave dry clothes
- No mistreatment (honorable behavior)
- Lt. Cdr. Kudo addressed survivors: "You have fought bravely. Now you are prisoners of the Japanese Navy. I respect you as sailors."

**Transfer:**
- Delivered POWs to Japanese forces
- Survivors entered POW camps (some died in captivity, conditions harsh)
- But many survived to tell story

**Legacy:**
- British survivors testified after war about Japanese honor
- Lt. Cdr. Kudo praised for humanity
- Contrast with other incidents (some Japanese units killed POWs)
- **Showed not all Japanese actions brutal** - individuals made honorable choices
- Ikazuchi's action remembered as bright spot in dark war

**Ikazuchi's Fate:**
- Continued fighting
- April 13, 1944: Torpedoed by USS Harder near Guam
- **Entire crew lost** (197 killed including Lt. Cdr. Kudo)
- Ironically, British sailors survived, Japanese rescuers died

**Global Influence:**

**Changed Destroyer Design Worldwide:**

**Before Fubuki (1920s):**
- Destroyers: Open gun mounts (crews exposed)
- Light torpedo armament (4-6 tubes)
- ~1,500 tons
- 30-35 knots
- Seen as expendable scouts/torpedo boats

**Fubuki-Class Innovation (1928):**
- **Enclosed gun turrets** - weatherproof, protected
- **9× 24-inch torpedoes** - devastating salvo
- **2,000 tons** - seaworthy, long-range
- **38 knots** - fastest afloat
- **Multi-role** - guns AND torpedoes equally important

**World Reaction:**

**Britain:**
- Studied Fubuki carefully (naval intelligence)
- Realized British destroyers obsolete
- Built **Tribal-class** (1938-1940)
  - 8× 4.7-inch guns in twin turrets (**enclosed** - copied Fubuki!)
  - 1,870 tons (larger, like Fubuki)
  - 36 knots
  - Directly influenced by Special Type

**United States:**
- 1930s US destroyers: 1,500 tons, 5 guns, open mounts
- After seeing Fubuki: Built larger destroyers
- **Fletcher-class** (1942-1945)
  - 5× 5-inch guns in enclosed mounts (**copied Fubuki concept**)
  - 2,050 tons (same as Fubuki!)
  - 10× 21-inch torpedoes (heavy torpedo armament like Fubuki)
  - 36 knots
  - Most successful US destroyer class (175 built!)
  - **Direct descendant of Fubuki design philosophy**

**France:**
- Built large destroyers (Contre-torpilleurs)
- Le Fantasque-class: Enclosed guns, 2,500 tons, 37 knots
- Influenced by Special Type arms race

**Germany:**
- Type 1934/1936 destroyers: Enclosed turrets, 2,200 tons
- Copied enclosed gun concept

**Italy:**
- Navigatori-class: Large destroyers, enclosed guns
- Response to Fubuki threat

**Result:**
- **1930s destroyer arms race** started by Fubuki
- All major navies copied enclosed turrets
- Destroyer size increased globally (1,500→2,000+ tons standard)
- Heavy torpedo armament became norm
- **Fubuki-class defined modern destroyer** (blueprint for WWII destroyers worldwide)

**87.5% Loss Rate:**

**Brutal Attrition:**
- 24 ships built
- 21 lost in action
- Only 3 survived war

**Why So High:**

1. **Entire War Service**: All 23 (minus peacetime loss) fought 1941-1945
2. **Frontline Combat**: Used in every major operation
   - Pearl Harbor, Wake, Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Midway, Guadalcanal, Solomons, Philippines again
3. **Night Battles**: Japanese doctrine emphasized night surface combat
   - Extremely dangerous (close-range gun/torpedo duels)
   - Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (night): 2 Fubuki-class blown apart
4. **Submarines**: 7 lost to US subs (Pacific became submarine shooting gallery by 1943-44)
5. **Aircraft**: 5 lost to carrier/land-based aircraft (US air dominance 1943+)
6. **No Replacements**: Built 1928-1932, no new construction
   - Ships worn out by 1944 (16 years old, hard use)
   - Machinery failing, crews exhausted
7. **Fought to End**: No early retirement (too valuable, fleet shrinking)

**Comparison - Other Classes:**
| Class | Built | Lost | Loss Rate | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Fubuki** | **24** | **21** | **87.5%** | **Highest major class** |
| Kagero | 19 | 18 | 94.7% | Higher % but smaller class |
| Akatsuki | 4 | 3 | 75% | Small class |
| Fletcher (US) | 175 | 25 | 14.3% | US had air superiority |

**Fubuki: Fought hardest, died hardest**

**Three Survivors:**

**1. Ushio** ("Tide"):
- Commissioned: November 14, 1931
- Service: Entire war (1941-1945) - Pearl Harbor to end
- Luck: Dodged submarines, aircraft, surface combat repeatedly
- Damage: Hit multiple times but survived
- August 1945: War ended, Ushio still afloat
- Post-war: Returned to Japan, decommissioned
- Fate: Scrapped 1948
- Legacy: Luckiest Fubuki-class

**2. Hibiki** ("Echo"):
- Commissioned: March 31, 1933
- Service: Midway, Aleutians, Guadalcanal, Philippines
- Damage: Torpedoed by submarine 1944 (survived!), multiple close calls
- August 1945: War ended, Hibiki survived
- Post-war: **Reparations to Soviet Union** (July 5, 1947)
- Renamed: **Vernyi** (Верный - "Faithful" in Russian)
- Soviet Navy service: 1947-1953 (6 years Soviet Navy!)
- Based: Vladivostok, training ship
- Fate: Scrapped USSR 1953 (age 20)
- Legacy: **Only Japanese destroyer to serve foreign navy post-war**
- Unique: Saw both Imperial Japanese Navy and Soviet Navy service

**3. Inazuma** ("Lightning"):
- Commissioned: November 15, 1932
- Service: Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Midway, entire war
- Infamous: Rammed/sank sister Miyuki in 1934 peacetime collision
- WWII: Fought throughout, survived
- August 1945: War ended
- Post-war: Returned to Japan, decommissioned
- Fate: Scrapped Japan 1947
- Legacy: Last Fubuki-class in Japanese service

**Why These Three:**
- **Luck**: Right place, right time (avoided fatal encounters)
- **Late-class ships**: Hibiki, Inazuma commissioned 1932-33 (newest, best condition)
- **Skill**: Good crews, competent commanders
- **Fortune**: War ended before they met fate of sisters

**Legacy:** Fubuki-class revolutionized destroyer design globally. 24 ships (1928-1932) first destroyers with enclosed gun turrets, heavy torpedo armament (9× 24-inch Long Lance), 38-knot speed. Changed naval warfare: All major navies copied enclosed turrets (British Tribal, US Fletcher directly influenced). All 24 fought entire WWII. 21 lost (87.5% casualty rate - highest of any major class). Famous incidents: Amagiri rammed PT-109 (JFK's boat, August 1943), Ikazuchi rescued 422 British sailors (March 1942 - honorable action). 3 survivors: Ushio (scrapped 1948), Hibiki/Vernyi (USSR service 1947-1953), Inazuma (scrapped 1947). Fubuki-class: Game-changers that defined modern destroyers, paid ultimate price in WWII.

**Historical Significance:** Fubuki-class marked Japan's emergence as destroyer design leader. Revolutionary enclosed turrets (1928) made previous destroyers obsolete worldwide. Sparked global arms race: Britain built Tribal-class (copied turrets), US built Fletcher-class (same size/philosophy), all navies followed. Shows Japanese naval innovation at peak: From 1920s importing British technology to 1928 teaching world how to build destroyers. Heavy Long Lance torpedo armament (9 tubes) reflected Japanese emphasis on decisive night battles. 38-knot speed made them fastest destroyers (lasted until 1943 Shimakaze). All 24 fought entire WWII - ultimate test. 21 lost (87.5%) shows brutal cost: Guadalcanal night battles (6 lost in 3 months), submarines, aircraft, surface combat. Famous actions: Amagiri vs PT-109 (created future US President JFK), Ikazuchi rescued 422 enemies (honor in war). Three survivors tell different stories: Ushio (lucky, fought whole war), Hibiki/Vernyi (only Japanese destroyer in Soviet Navy), Inazuma (last in Japanese service). From 1928 game-changers to 1945 battered survivors, Fubuki-class embodied IJN spirit: Innovation, aggression, sacrifice. Every modern destroyer (1930s-today) owes debt to Fubuki-class design. Remembered as destroyers that changed the world.
