**Oil-Fired Transition** - Momo-class were WWI Japanese destroyers. 8 ships commissioned 1916-1917. Improved Kaba-class with oil-firing (not coal). Three-shaft turbines (unusual configuration). Three 4.7-inch guns + six 21-inch torpedoes. 31.5 knots. First Japanese oil-fired destroyers. All eight scrapped 1932-1936 (treaty limits, obsolete). None survived to WWII. Represented transition from coal to oil, from reciprocating to turbines - WWI technological evolution.

**Key Specs:** 835/1,020 tons | 285ft | 31.5 kn | 3× 120mm + 6× 533mm torpedoes | Oil-fired turbines | 3 shafts | 8 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese oil-fired destroyers (major advancement from coal). Steam turbines (modern vs reciprocating engines). Three-shaft configuration (unusual - most two shafts). Larger than earlier destroyers (835 vs 665 tons). Three 4.7-inch guns. Six 21-inch torpedoes (modern caliber vs 18-inch). WWI construction (1916-1917). All scrapped 1932-1936 (Washington/London Treaties - tonnage limits). None survived to WWII. Transitional design - showed evolution from coal/reciprocating (Kaba) to oil/turbines before mass-produced Minekaze-class standardized design. Oil-firing eliminated coal smoke, improved range, reduced crew labor.

**Design:** Medium destroyer hull (285 ft, 835 tons). Three single 4.7-inch guns (one forward, two aft). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes (three twin mounts amidships). Oil-fired boilers (first for Japanese destroyers - major advancement). Steam turbines. **Three shafts** (unusual - most destroyers two shafts). 31.5 knots. Improved range (2,500 nm vs coal predecessors ~1,600 nm). Crew 110. Unarmored. Modern WWI construction - oil fuel bunkers, turbine machinery, improved fire control. Transitional between WWI emergency builds and standardized post-war designs.

**Ships (8 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1932-1936:**
1. **Momo** - Scrapped 1932
2. **Kashi** - Scrapped 1933
3. **Hinoki** - Scrapped 1933
4. **Yanagi** - Scrapped 1934
5. **Enoki** - Scrapped 1935
6. **Nara** - Scrapped 1935
7. **Tsubaki** - Scrapped 1936
8. **Nire** - Scrapped 1936 (not same as later Kaba-class Nire lost WWII)

**Construction:**
- Builders: Multiple naval yards
- Laid down: 1915-1916
- Commissioned: 1916-1917
- WWI emergency program

**Service History:**

**WWI (1916-1918):**
- Commissioned during war
- Pacific operations (Pacific quiet - Germany defeated early)
- Convoy escort
- Training
- Limited combat

**Interwar Period (1919-1936):**

**1919-1930:**
- Fleet exercises
- Training ships
- China station patrols
- By 1925 already becoming obsolete (larger destroyers building)

**1930-1936:**
- **London Naval Treaty (1930):** Destroyer tonnage limits
- Japan exceeded limits
- Old destroyers targeted for scrapping
- **All 8 Momo-class scrapped 1932-1936**
- Freed ~6,700 tons for modern destroyers (Fubuki, Hatsuharu classes)

**Why All Scrapped 1932-1936:**

**Treaty Pressure:**
1. **Tonnage limits:** Japan allowed only so many destroyer tons
2. **Excess:** Japan had too many destroyers (WWI emergency builds)
3. **Priority:** Modern destroyers (Fubuki 1,980 tons) vs old (Momo 835 tons)
4. **Strategic choice:** Eight Momos (~6,700 tons) = three-four modern destroyers

**Technical Obsolescence:**
1. **Size:** 835 tons (modern 1,500-2,000 tons)
2. **Age:** 15-20 years old by scrapping
3. **Speed:** 31.5 knots (modern 35-38 knots)
4. **Armament:** Three 4.7-inch (modern six 5-inch)
5. **No value:** Not worth keeping even for training

**Three-Shaft Configuration:**

**Unusual Design:**
- Most destroyers: Two shafts (port and starboard)
- **Momo-class: Three shafts** (port, center, starboard)

**Advantages:**
- Better maneuverability
- Redundancy (lose one shaft, still have two)
- Power distribution

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex machinery
- Higher maintenance
- Center shaft vulnerable (shallow draft issues)
- More expensive

**Why Three Shafts:**
- WWI experimentation
- Trying different configurations
- Learning optimal design
- **Later abandoned:** Two shafts became standard (simpler, adequate)

**Oil-Firing Revolution:**

**Why Oil Better than Coal:**

**Operational:**
1. **Range:** More energy-dense (2,500 nm vs coal's ~1,600 nm)
2. **Refueling:** Pumped (fast) vs shoveled (slow)
3. **Smoke:** Less visible (tactical advantage)
4. **Speed:** Quick response (oil sprays vs coal stoking)

**Personnel:**
1. **Labor:** No coal handling crew needed
2. **Cleaner:** Less dirt, better crew morale
3. **Efficiency:** Smaller crew possible

**Strategic:**
1. **Flexibility:** Can refuel at sea easier
2. **Storage:** More efficient bunker use
3. **Maintenance:** Less machinery fouling

**Momo-Class:**
- First Japanese destroyers to eliminate coal entirely
- Proved oil-firing superior
- All later destroyers oil-fired
- Revolutionary change 1916

**Comparison - WWI Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | Fuel | Shafts | Fate |
|-------|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|
| **Momo (WWII era)** | **8** | **1916** | **835** | **Oil** | **3** | **Scrapped 1930s** |
| Kaba | 10 | 1915 | 665 | Coal/oil | 2 | 6 scrapped, 4 lost WWII |
| Momi | 21 | 1919 | 850 | Oil | 2 | 13 scrapped, 8 lost WWII |
| Minekaze | 15 | 1920 | 1,215 | Oil | 2 | All lost WWII |

**Momo: Transitional - first all-oil, three shafts experimental**

**Why None Survived to WWII:**

**Unlike Kaba (4 survived):**
- Momo-class scrapped earlier (1932-1936 vs 1940)
- Treaty pressure greater on newer ships (more tonnage)
- Less useful (Kaba older, relegated to auxiliaries; Momo modern enough to count as "real" destroyers in treaty tonnage)
- Strategic: Better to keep very old ships (low value) or very new ships (high value), scrap middle-aged ships like Momo

**Good Decision:**
- If kept to WWII, would have suffered same fate as Kaba (100% loss)
- Better scrapped 1930s than lost 1940s
- Freed tonnage for superior destroyers

**Legacy:** Momo-class represented WWI oil-firing transition. Eight ships (1916-1917) - first Japanese all-oil destroyers. Three-shaft configuration (experimental, later abandoned). Three 4.7-inch guns, six 21-inch torpedoes, 31.5 knots. All scrapped 1932-1936 (treaty tonnage limits). None survived to WWII. Transitional design - showed evolution from coal (Kaba) to standardized oil designs (Momi, Minekaze). Oil-firing proved superior - all later Japanese destroyers oil-fired. Three-shaft experiment not repeated (two shafts adequate). Names: Trees (Momo=Peach, Kashi=Oak, Hinoki=Cypress, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Momo-class marked oil-firing revolution for Japanese destroyers. Built 1916-1917 when coal still common but oil proving superior. First all-oil Japanese destroyers - eliminated coal entirely. Proved oil advantages (range, speed, cleanliness). Three-shaft configuration experimental - tried, evaluated, abandoned (two shafts simpler). All eight scrapped 1932-1936 under treaty pressure - sensible given obsolescence. Compare evolution: Kaba (1915, coal/oil mixed, 665 tons) → Momo (1916, all-oil, 835 tons) → Minekaze (1920, oil, 1,215 tons) → Fubuki (1928, oil, 1,980 tons, revolutionary). Momo: Middle step. Not remembered like Fubuki, but necessary transition. Oil-firing lesson applied to all future ships. Three-shaft lesson: interesting but unnecessary. Represented WWI technological experimentation before standardization.
