**Fast Veterans** - Minekaze-class were WWI-era destroyers with high speed. 15 ships built 1920-1922. Four 4.7-inch guns + six 24-inch torpedoes. 39 knots speed (fast for 1920). Obsolete by WWII but all 15 saw combat. 12 lost in action (80%), only 3 survived war but scrapped. Nadakaze only survivor not used for repatriation then scrapped.

**Key Specs:** 1,215/1,650 tons | 336ft | 39 kn | 4× 120mm + 6× 610mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 15 ships

**Innovation:** High speed for WWI era (39 knots). First mass-produced IJN destroyers exceeding 38 knots. Four 4.7-inch guns, six 24-inch torpedoes. Light and fast. Built 1920-1922, fought 1941-1945 despite age (20-25 years old in combat). 80% loss rate showed vulnerability of obsolete ships in modern war. Only one (Nadakaze) survived war intact.

**Design:** Four single 4.7-inch guns (two forward, two aft). Two triple 24-inch torpedo launchers. High speed (39 knots) from powerful turbines. Light displacement (1,215 tons standard). Small crew (148). Good for WWI/1920s, inadequate by 1940s. Minimal AA armament. Depth charges for ASW. Unarmored. Simple, economical design optimized for speed.

**Loss Statistics:**
- **15 built, 12 lost in combat (80% loss rate)**
- **Causes:**
  - Submarine: 8 ships (67% of losses)
  - Air attack: 3 ships (25% of losses)
  - Surface action: 1 ship (8% of losses)
- **Loss period:** February 1943 - July 1945 (29 months)
- **Survival rate:** 20% (3 of 15, but only 1 intact)

**Why Heavy Submarine Losses:**
1. **Old design:** Built 1920, no modern ASW detection
2. **Convoy escort:** Vulnerable role, predictable routes
3. **No radar:** Could not detect submarines at night
4. **Slow ASW response:** Limited depth charges, old tactics
5. **US submarine superiority:** By 1943-1944, US subs dominated

**120mm/45 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Mutsuki-class
- **Caliber:** 120mm (4.7 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 15,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 8-10 rounds per minute
- Obsolete by WWII standards

**Comparison - WWI Era Destroyers:**
| Feature | Minekaze (1920) | Fubuki (1928) | Fletcher (USA, 1942) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Displacement | 1,215 tons | 2,090 tons | 2,500 tons |
| Main guns | 4× 4.7" | 6× 5" | 5× 5" |
| Torpedoes | 6× 24" | 9× 24" | 10× 21" |
| Speed | 39 knots | 38 knots | 37 knots |
| Crew | 148 | 197 | 329 |

**USS Harder's Famous Patrol (June 1944):**
*Five destroyers in four days - two were Minekaze-class*

**June 6-24, 1944:**
- USS Harder (SS-257) conducted aggressive patrol
- **Sank 5 destroyers in 4 days:**
  - Tanikaze (June 6)
  - Minazuki (June 7)
  - Hayanami (June 7)
  - **Hakaze (June 9)** - Minekaze-class
  - **Yukaze (June 16)** - Minekaze-class

**Significance:**
- Most destroyers sunk by single submarine in one patrol
- Forced Japanese fleet to avoid area
- Harder lost later (August 1944) with all hands

**Why Used in WWII Despite Age:**
1. **Speed still useful:** 39 knots adequate for convoy escort
2. **All hulls needed:** Destroyer shortage acute
3. **Familiar design:** Crews trained on these ships
4. **Good range:** 3,600 nm suitable for Pacific
5. **Torpedoes effective:** Six 24-inch torpedoes still deadly

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Convoy escort:** Primary role by 1943
- **Tokyo Express:** Fast supply runs early war
- **ASW patrols:** Submarine hunting (ironic given losses)
- **Transport:** Fast troop/supply transport
- **Screening:** Occasional fleet escort duties

**Modernization (1930s-1940s):**
- AA armament increased: 4× to 20+ 25mm guns (some ships)
- Depth charges increased: 18 to 36
- Fire control improved
- Radar added (some ships, late war)
- But fundamentally limited by age and small size

**Legacy:** Minekaze-class represented WWI-era destroyer design still fighting in WWII. High speed (39 knots) for 1920 but obsolete by 1941. All 15 saw combat despite age (20-25 years old). 80% loss rate (12 of 15 lost) showed vulnerability of old, small destroyers. Eight lost to submarines - highest percentage of any IJN destroyer class. USS Harder sank two in famous June 1944 patrol. Only Nadakaze survived war intact. Speed still useful but lack of modern equipment fatal. Names: Wind and wave terms.

**Historical Significance:** Minekaze-class epitomized Japan's desperate shortage - WWI-era ships (built 1920) fighting modern war (1941-1945). 80% loss rate among highest of any destroyer class. Submarine losses (67%) showed US submarine campaign's effectiveness. USS Harder's patrol (2 Minekaze-class sunk in days) demonstrated submarine threat. Ships 20-25 years old in combat - would be like fighting WWIII with 1990s technology. Four survivors (including one intact) showed some luck existed but odds terrible. Represented generation built for different era, destroyed by evolution of warfare. High speed (39 knots) only advantage - everything else obsolete.
