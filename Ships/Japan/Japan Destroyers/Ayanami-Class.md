**Middle Fubukis** - Ayanami-class (Special Type II) were the second batch of Fubuki-class destroyers. 10 ships commissioned 1930-1931. Six 5-inch guns + nine Long Lance torpedoes. 38 knots. Intermediate evolution between original Fubukis and final Akatsuki-class. All ten saw intensive combat. All ten lost 1942-1944 (100% loss rate). Ayanami sunk at fierce night battle off Guadalcanal. Uranami last sunk November 26, 1944 - last Fubuki-type destroyer lost. Represented Japanese destroyer design maturity.

**Key Specs:** 1,980/2,390 tons | 388ft | 38 kn | 6× 127mm + 9× 610mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 10 ships

**Innovation:** Second Fubuki batch (Special Type II) with improvements over original. Nine torpedo tubes (three triple launchers) vs original configuration. Better stability than early Fubukis (topweight issues addressed). Three twin 5-inch turrets. 38 knots. Good range (5,000 nm). All ten extensively combat-tested throughout war. 100% loss rate showed even excellent 1930s destroyers couldn't survive 1942-1944 attrition. Ayanami died in fierce Guadalcanal night battle (November 1942). Uranami last lost (November 1944) - final Fubuki-type casualty. Represented peak 1930s destroyer design before war tested limits.

**Design:** Three twin 5-inch turrets (one forward, two aft superfiring). Three triple torpedo launchers (nine torpedoes total - originally centerline, modified in war). Four 25mm AA guns (increased to 20+ during war). 18 depth charges. Two-shaft turbines (38 knots). Long range (5,000 nm at 14 knots). Unarmored. Crew 220. Refined Fubuki design - better stability, improved fire control. Well-balanced destroyers for 1930 but inadequate AA for 1943-1944. Special Type II designation indicated improvements over original Fubuki batch.

**Comparison - Fubuki Subclasses:**
| Subclass | Ships | Commissioned | Torpedoes | Lost | Survival | Last Lost |
|----------|-------|--------------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Ayanami (II)** | **10** | **1930-31** | **9** | **10** | **0%** | **Nov 1944** |
| Fubuki (I) | 24 | 1928-32 | 9 | 21 | 13% | Jun 1944 |
| Akatsuki (III) | 4 | 1932-33 | 8 | 3 | 25% | May 1944 |

**Ayanami: Worst survival rate (0%)**

**Why 100% Loss Rate:**
1. **Long service:** 1930-1944 (14 years for Uranami)
2. **Intensive use:** All major campaigns
3. **No reserves:** All ten used constantly
4. **1942-1944:** Period of heaviest losses
5. **Air power:** 50% lost to aircraft (1943-1944)
6. **Submarines:** 30% lost to subs
7. **No luck:** Not one survived to surrender

**PT-109 Incident - Historical Impact:**

**Immediate:**
- 2 US sailors killed
- PT-109 lost
- Kennedy survived (heroic rescue of crew)

**Long-term:**
- Kennedy's war record crucial to political career
- "PT-109" - campaign slogan
- Movie made (1963)
- Amagiri crew unaware they hit future President
- Ironic: Japanese destroyer helped create US President

**Uranami - Last Fubuki-Type:**

**Significance:**
- November 26, 1944 - last Special Type destroyer lost
- Original Fubuki class commissioned 1928
- **16-year design lifespan** (1928-1944)
- All 38 Fubuki-types lost (original + subclasses)
- End of revolutionary 1920s destroyer design
- Replaced by Kagero, Yugumo, Akizuki types (all also mostly lost)

**Legacy:** Ayanami-class represented intermediate Fubuki evolution (Special Type II). Ten ships commissioned 1930-1931 between original Fubukis and final Akatsuki-class. Nine torpedoes, six 5-inch guns, 38 knots. All ten lost 1942-1944 (100% loss rate - worst of Fubuki subclasses). Amagiri famous for ramming PT-109 (Kennedy's boat, August 1943) - helped create future US President. Ayanami died in fierce Guadalcanal night battle. Uranami last lost (November 1944) - final Fubuki-type casualty, end of 16-year design era. Names: Weather/natural phenomena (Ayanami=Twill Wave, Amagiri=Heavenly Mist, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Ayanami-class showed full cycle of destroyer design obsolescence. Commissioned 1930-1931 as world's best destroyers - six 5-inch guns, nine torpedoes, 38 knots revolutionary. But 100% loss rate 1942-1944 showed 1930s excellence couldn't survive 1940s warfare. Half lost to air power (Allied air dominance 1943-1944). Amagiri's PT-109 ramming (August 1943) unintentionally created US President Kennedy - showed historical accidents. Uranami's loss (November 26, 1944) ended Special Type era - all 38 Fubuki-types lost by then. Represented what Japan achieved in 1930s (world-class destroyers) vs what Japan faced by 1944 (overwhelming Allied power). Zero survivors of ten ships - complete annihilation of excellent design.
