**WWI Veterans** - Kamikaze-class were WWI-era destroyers. 9 ships built 1922-1924. Four 4.7-inch guns + six 21-inch torpedoes. High speed (37 knots). Oldest destroyers in WWII combat (20-22 years old when fighting). All 9 saw action - 6 lost, 3 survived. Kamikaze (name ship) achieved rare distinction of surviving entire war. Obsolete but pressed into service for desperate convoy escort and patrol duties.

**Key Specs:** 1,270/1,720 tons | 336ft | 37.3 kn | 4× 120mm + 6× 533mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 9 ships

**Innovation:** WWI-era design (1920s) still fighting modern war (1941-1945). High speed (37.3 knots) for 1922. Four 4.7-inch guns, six 21-inch torpedoes (smaller than 24-inch of later ships). Light and fast but obsolete by WWII. All 9 saw combat despite age - showed desperate need for hulls. 67% loss rate (6 of 9 lost). Kamikaze survived entire war (name ship's good fortune). Represented generation built for different era, destroyed by modern warfare.

**Design:** Four single 4.7-inch guns (two forward, two aft). Two triple 21-inch torpedo launchers (smaller than 24-inch standard). High speed (37.3 knots) from powerful turbines. Light displacement (1,270 tons standard). Small crew (148). Good for 1920s, inadequate by 1940s. Minimal AA armament (added later). Depth charges for ASW. Unarmored. Simple, economical design for mass production post-WWI.

**Ships (9 built):**

**Lost in combat (6):**
1. **Kamikaze** - **SURVIVED ENTIRE WAR**, scrapped 1947
2. **Asakaze** - Sunk August 23, 1944 (submarine USS Haddo, off Luzon)
3. **Harukaze** - Sunk June 9, 1944 (air attack, Tawi-Tawi)
4. **Matsukaze** - Sunk June 9, 1944 (air attack, Tawi-Tawi) - same day as Harukaze
5. **Hatakaze** - Sunk November 17, 1943 (submarine, near Formosa)
6. **Oite** - Sunk February 18, 1944 (air attack, Truk)
7. **Hayate** - Sunk December 11, 1941 (surface action, Wake Island) - **First IJN ship sunk WWII**

**Survived war (3):**
8. **Kamikaze** - Survived, scrapped 1947 (name ship)
9. **Asanagi** - Survived damaged, scrapped 1947
10. **Yunagi** - Survived, scrapped 1947

**Construction:**
- Builders: Maizuru, Uraga, Yokohama
- Laid down: 1921-1922
- Commissioned: 1922-1924

**Major Operations:**

**Hayate - Battle of Wake Island (December 11, 1941):**
*First IJN ship sunk in WWII*

**Background:**
- Japanese invasion of Wake Island
- US Marine defense with coastal guns

**December 11, 1941 (Dawn):**
- Hayate approaching Wake to land troops
- **Hit by US Marine 5-inch coastal gun battery**
- Direct hit to forward magazine
- **Catastrophic explosion**
- **Broke in half and sank immediately**
- **All hands lost (~168 crew)**
- **First Japanese warship sunk in WWII**
- **First US victory of Pacific War**

**Significance:**
- Occurred before Pearl Harbor attack fully developed
- Showed US Marines could fight back
- Boosted US morale
- Wake held out until December 23

**Guadalcanal Campaign:**

**November 17, 1943 - Hatakaze:**
- Convoy escort near Formosa
- **Torpedoed by submarine** (possibly USS Blackfish)
- Sank rapidly
- Heavy casualties

**Oite - Truk Air Raid (February 18, 1944):**
*Operation Hailstone*

**Background:**
- Massive US carrier raid on Truk
- Japan's "Gibraltar of Pacific"
- Oite at anchorage

**February 18, 1944:**
- **Attacked by US carrier aircraft** (Operation Hailstone)
- Attempted to escape harbor
- Hit by bombs from dive bombers
- Additional strafing attacks
- **Dead in water, fires throughout**
- **Capsized and sank**
- ~70+ killed

**Philippines/Tawi-Tawi (June 1944):**

**June 9, 1944 - Harukaze and Matsukaze:**
*Double loss in one day*

**Background:**
- Both at Tawi-Tawi anchorage
- Pre-Philippine Sea battle concentration
- US carrier raids hitting Japanese bases

**June 9, 1944:**
- **US carrier aircraft attacked Tawi-Tawi**
- Both Harukaze and Matsukaze hit by bombs
- Harukaze: Hit multiple times, fires, sank in harbor
- Matsukaze: Hit and damaged, beached, later sank
- **Both lost same day**
- Combined casualties ~150+

**August 23, 1944 - Asakaze:**
- Convoy escort off Luzon
- **Torpedoed by USS Haddo** (submarine)
- Sank after sustained damage
- Heavy casualties

**Survivors:**

**Kamikaze (name ship) - The Lucky One:**
*Only Kamikaze-class to survive entire war undamaged*

**Service:**
- 1922-1945: 23 years active
- China operations 1930s
- WWII: Convoy escort, patrols
- Multiple close calls but never severely damaged
- Avoided major battles through luck and assignments
- **Surrendered intact August 1945**
- Used for repatriation 1945-1947
- Scrapped 1947

**Significance:** Name "Kamikaze" means "Divine Wind" (typhoon that saved Japan in 1281). Ship lived up to name - divine protection through entire war.

**Asanagi:**
- Damaged during war but survived
- Less frontline service than sisters
- Surrendered 1945
- Scrapped 1947

**Yunagi:**
- Training and patrol duties
- Avoided major combat
- Survived to surrender
- Scrapped 1947

**Loss Statistics:**
- **9 built, 6 lost in combat (67% loss rate)**
- **Causes:**
  - Air attack: 3 ships (50% of losses)
  - Submarine: 2 ships (33% of losses)
  - Surface action: 1 ship (17% of losses)
- **Loss period:** December 1941 - August 1944 (33 months)
- **Survival rate:** 33% (3 of 9)

**Why Heavy Losses:**
1. **Age:** 20-22 years old in combat
2. **Small size:** 1,270 tons, limited survivability
3. **Poor AA:** Minimal anti-aircraft armament
4. **Old design:** No modern radar, fire control
5. **Vulnerable missions:** Convoy escort exposed to submarines, aircraft
6. **No armor:** Light construction, no protection

**120mm/45 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Mutsuki and Minekaze classes
- **Caliber:** 120mm (4.7 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 15,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 8-10 rounds per minute
- Obsolete by WWII standards (5-inch became standard)

**Comparison - 1920s Destroyers in WWII:**
| Class | Built | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Lost | Survival Rate |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Kamikaze** | **1922-24** | **1,270** | **37 kn** | **4× 4.7"** | **6/9** | **33%** |
| Minekaze | 1920-22 | 1,215 | 39 kn | 4× 4.7" | 12/15 | 20% |
| Mutsuki | 1926-27 | 1,315 | 37 kn | 4× 4.7" | 9/12 | 25% |

**All showed:**
- High loss rates (67-80%)
- Vulnerability of old ships
- Desperate need for any hulls
- Air power dominant threat

**Wake Island Significance:**

**Hayate's Loss (December 11, 1941):**
- **First IJN ship sunk in WWII**
- **First US victory of Pacific War**
- Morale boost for US
- Showed Marines could fight back
- Wake held out 12 more days
- "Send us more Japs" (disputed but famous)

**Context:**
- Occurred while Pearl Harbor attack still developing
- US needed any good news
- Hayate loss proved Japan not invincible

**Why Used in WWII Despite Age:**
1. **Destroyer shortage:** Every hull needed
2. **Speed still useful:** 37 knots adequate for escorts
3. **Torpedoes effective:** Six 21-inch torpedoes deadly
4. **ASW capable:** Depth charges for submarines
5. **Familiar:** Crews trained on these designs
6. **No choice:** War demanded all available ships

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Convoy escort:** Primary late-war role
- **Patrol duties:** Coastal and harbor defense
- **Training:** New crew training
- **Transport:** Fast supply runs (occasional)
- **ASW:** Submarine hunting

**Modernization (1930s-1940s):**
- AA armament increased: 0 to 8× 25mm
- Depth charges increased: 18 to 36 (some)
- Fire control improved (minimal)
- Radar added (very late, if at all)
- But fundamentally limited by age and size

**Legacy:** Kamikaze-class represented WWI-era destroyers fighting WWII. Built 1922-1924, fought 1941-1945 at ages 20-22. 67% loss rate (6 of 9) showed vulnerability of obsolete ships. Hayate achieved tragic distinction - first IJN ship sunk WWII (Wake Island, December 11, 1941). Kamikaze (name ship) achieved opposite - survived entire war ("Divine Wind" lived up to name). Three survivors (33%) showed some luck but odds terrible. Speed (37 knots) only advantage - everything else obsolete. Pressed into service from desperate need. Names: Wind types (Kamikaze=Divine Wind, Asakaze=Morning Breeze, Harukaze=Spring Wind, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Kamikaze-class epitomized Japan's situation - even 20-year-old WWI destroyers pressed into combat. 67% loss rate expected for obsolete ships in modern war. Hayate's loss (Wake Island, first ship sunk) symbolized US resistance from Day 1. Ironically, Kamikaze survived entire war - "Divine Wind" name proved prophetic. Ships built for 1920s, destroyed by 1940s technology (aircraft, submarines, radar). Showed that age, size, equipment all mattered - obsolete ships died at high rates. Three survivors (Kamikaze, Asanagi, Yunagi) lucky to see surrender. All scrapped 1947. Represented generation built for different world, destroyed in new one.
