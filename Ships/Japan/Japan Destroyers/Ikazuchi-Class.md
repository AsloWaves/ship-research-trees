**First Japanese Destroyers** - Ikazuchi-class were Japan's first domestically-built destroyers. 2 ships commissioned 1899. Built in Japan to British (Thorneycroft) design. Tiny (305 tons), coal-fired, 31 knots. One 3-inch gun + five 6-pounders + two 18-inch torpedoes. Russo-Japanese War veterans (1904-1905). Both scrapped 1913 after 14 years service. Represented Japan's transition from buying foreign warships to building domestically. Founded Japanese destroyer tradition - first of hundreds to follow.

**Key Specs:** 305/363 tons | 220ft | 31 kn | 1× 76mm + 5× 57mm + 2× 450mm torpedoes | Coal reciprocating | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Japan's first domestically-constructed destroyers (1899). Built to British Thorneycroft design under license at Japanese yards. Tiny (305 tons - true torpedo boat destroyer size). Coal-fired reciprocating engines. 31 knots (very fast for 1899 - matched British boats). One 3-inch gun forward. Five 6-pounder guns. Two single 18-inch torpedo tubes. Both fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) despite being 5-6 years old. Both scrapped 1913 (14 years service). Critical milestone: Proved Japan could build modern torpedo craft domestically, not just buy from Britain. Founded destroyer tradition that culminated in world-class WWII designs (Fubuki, Kagero, Yugumo). From student to master in 40 years.

**Design:** Very small hull (220 ft, 305 tons - barely larger than torpedo boat). Single 3-inch gun forward (primary weapon). Five 6-pounder guns (lighter weapons, anti-torpedo boat). Two single 18-inch torpedo tubes (one each side amidships - destroyer's main weapon). Coal-fired vertical reciprocating steam engines. Two shafts. 31 knots (very fast for 1899). Limited range (1,200 nm - coastal operations). Unarmored. Crew 60. Japanese construction to British plans. Victorian-era technology. Purpose: Destroy enemy torpedo boats, launch own torpedo attacks.

**Ships (2 built - both scrapped):**

**Both Japanese-built, both scrapped 1913:**
1. **Ikazuchi** - Commissioned February 15, 1899, Russo-Japanese War, scrapped 1913
2. **Inazuma** - Commissioned March 26, 1899, Russo-Japanese War, scrapped 1913

**Construction:**

**Both ships:**
- **Design:** Thorneycroft (British) - license-built in Japan
- **Builders:** Japanese yards (Yokosuka Naval Arsenal)
- **Laid down:** 1897-1898
- **Launched:** 1898
- **Commissioned:** 1899
- **Significance:** First destroyers built in Japan

**Why Important - Domestic Construction:**

**Technology Transfer:**
- Before Ikazuchi: Japan bought destroyers from Britain
- Ikazuchi-class: British design, **built in Japan**
- After Ikazuchi: Japan built own designs domestically
- Critical step: From customer to manufacturer

**Evolution:**
- 1890s: Buying British ships
- 1899: Building British designs in Japan (Ikazuchi)
- 1900s: Building Japanese-modified designs
- 1920s-1930s: Building world-leading designs (Fubuki revolutionized destroyers globally)

**Service History:**

**Early Service (1899-1904):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training Japanese crews
- Torpedo tactics development
- China station patrols
- Preparing for expected war with Russia

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
*Both Participated Despite Being 5-6 Years Old*

**Background:**
- War with Russia (European great power)
- Naval superiority decisive
- Every destroyer needed

**Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905):**
- **Both Ikazuchi and Inazuma present**
- Part of destroyer flotilla
- Torpedo attacks on Russian Baltic Fleet
- Fleet screening duties
- **Japanese victory complete**
- Russia sued for peace

**Age Factor:**
- 6 years old when war started (1904)
- Small (305 tons)
- But: Still useful for torpedo attacks
- Both survived war

**Post-War (1905-1913):**

**1905-1910:**
- Training ships
- Reserve fleet
- Already obsolete (larger destroyers building)
- Technology moving rapidly

**1911-1913:**
- Reserve status only
- Completely outdated
- **Both scrapped 1913**
- 14 years service (adequate for era)

**Why Only 14-Year Service:**

**Short by Later Standards:**
- WWII destroyers often served 20-30+ years
- **Ikazuchi-class: Only 14 years**

**Reasons:**
1. **Rapid technology advance:** 1899-1913 saw huge naval developments
2. **Small size:** 305 tons (later destroyers 1,000-2,000 tons)
3. **First generation:** Experimental, learning phase
4. **Better ships available:** Japan building larger, more capable boats
5. **Coal-fired:** Already transitioning to oil by 1913

**Not Worth Keeping:**
- Too small for combat
- Too primitive even for training
- Scrapped to make room for modern fleet

**Thorneycroft Design:**

**British Designer:**
- John I. Thorneycroft & Company
- Famous British destroyer builder
- Pioneered torpedo boat destroyer concept
- Licensed designs to foreign navies

**Ikazuchi-Class:**
- Thorneycroft design
- Built in Japan (technology transfer)
- Similar to British boats of era
- 31 knots (very fast)
- Proved design sound

**31 Knots in 1899:**

**Very Fast for Era:**
- Battleships 1899: 16-18 knots
- Cruisers 1899: 18-22 knots
- **Ikazuchi: 31 knots** (significantly faster)

**How Achieved:**
- Light hull (305 tons)
- Powerful reciprocating engines (6,000 shp)
- Coal-fired but optimized
- Speed priority (sacrifice armor, endurance)

**Purpose:**
- Catch torpedo boats (20-25 knots)
- Escape battleship fire
- Position for torpedo attacks
- Retreat after attacking

**Comparison - First Japanese Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Year | Tons | Built | Speed | Wars | Service | Fate |
|-------|-------|------|------|-------|-------|------|---------|------|
| **Ikazuchi** | **2** | **1899** | **305** | **Japan** | **31 kn** | **Russo** | **14 yrs** | **Scrapped 1913** |
| Murakumo | 6 | 1900-01 | 336 | Japan | 31 kn | Russo | 20-22 yrs | Scrapped 1920s |
| Harusame | 4 | 1903-05 | 375 | Japan | 31 kn | Russo | 20 yrs | Scrapped 1920s |

**Ikazuchi: First built, smallest, shortest service (but pioneering role)**

**Russo-Japanese War Significance:**

**Small Boats, Big Victory:**
- Ikazuchi and Inazuma: 305 tons each
- Russian battleships: 10,000-15,000 tons
- David vs Goliath

**Destroyer Role:**
- Torpedo attacks disrupted Russian formations
- Night attacks prevented escape
- Screening Japanese battleships
- Rescue survivors
- **First time Asian power defeated European power at sea**

**Ikazuchi and Inazuma Contribution:**
- Small but participated
- Torpedo attacks on Russian fleet
- Both survived (no losses)
- Part of historic victory

**Name Meanings:**

**Thunder Theme:**
- **Ikazuchi** = Thunder
- **Inazuma** = Lightning
- Appropriate: Fast attack boats striking suddenly
- Names later reused multiple times

**Name Reuse:**

**Inazuma:**
- Original: Ikazuchi-class (1899-1913)
- Later: Akatsuki-class destroyer (1932-1944)
  - WWII service
  - Rescued 422 Allied survivors from HMS Exeter, HMS Encounter, USS Pope (March 1942)
  - Sunk May 14, 1944
- Name honored three times total

**Legacy:** Ikazuchi-class represented Japan's first domestically-built destroyers. Two tiny ships (305 tons) commissioned 1899 to British Thorneycroft design built in Japanese yards. Critical milestone: Proved Japan could construct modern torpedo craft, not just buy them. 31 knots, coal-fired, one 3-inch gun + two torpedoes. Both fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) despite being 5-6 years old - part of Japan's historic naval victory over Russia. Both scrapped 1913 after 14 years service when technology advanced beyond them. Founded Japanese destroyer tradition: Ikazuchi (1899, 305 tons, British design built in Japan) → 30 years later → Fubuki (1928, 1,980 tons, Japanese design, world's best). From copying to innovating. Names Ikazuchi and Inazuma later reused for WWII destroyers - original ships earned that honor.

**Historical Significance:** Ikazuchi-class marked Japan's transition from naval customer to manufacturer. Before 1899: Bought warships from Britain (Takao, Suma, Naniwa - all British-built). Ikazuchi (1899): British design, **built in Japan** - technology transfer, learning, capability development. After Ikazuchi: Japan building own designs, becoming naval power. By 1905: Defeated Russia (European great power) at Tsushima. By 1928: Built Fubuki-class destroyers that revolutionized global destroyer design - world's best. Evolution visible: Ikazuchi (1899, 305 tons, copy British) → Murakumo (1900, 336 tons, Japanese-modified) → Fubuki (1928, 1,980 tons, revolutionary original). 29 years: Student to master. Ikazuchi and Inazuma: Humble beginning, enormous consequence. First steps toward naval greatness. Without learning to build destroyers (1899), Japan couldn't have built world's best (1928). Foundation stones.
