**Smallest Destroyers** - Momi-class were tiny WWI-era destroyers. 21 ships built 1920-1922. Very small (850 tons), three 4.7-inch guns, four 21-inch torpedoes, 36 knots. Obsolete by 1930s - most converted to patrol boats (1939-1940) or scrapped. Only 4 retained as destroyers for WWII service, all 4 lost in combat 1942-1944. Smallest destroyers in IJN WWII service.

**Key Specs:** 850/1,050 tons | 275ft | 36 kn | 3× 120mm + 4× 533mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 21 ships (4 WWII combat)

**Innovation:** Extremely compact destroyers (WWI emergency design). Only 850 tons - destroyer size but capabilities limited. Three 4.7-inch guns (minimal). Four 21-inch torpedoes. High speed (36 knots) for size. Built 1920-1922 for quantity over quality. By 1939, most obsolete - 13 converted to patrol boats (Nos. 31-38 series), 4 scrapped before war. Only 4 retained destroyer designation for WWII (Momi, Kaya, Nashi, Tsuga). All 4 lost 1942-1944. Smallest IJN destroyers in combat.

**Design:** Three single 4.7-inch guns (one forward, two aft). Four single 21-inch torpedo tubes. Minimal AA armament. Depth charges for ASW. Tiny - 850 tons standard displacement (smaller than some frigates). Small crew (110). High speed (36 knots) but short range. Light construction, no armor. Cramped quarters. Good for 1920, inadequate by 1940. Simple, cheap, quickly built for WWI demand.

**Ships (21 built):**

**WWII Destroyer Service (4 ships - all lost):**
1. **Momi** - Sunk December 5, 1942 (air attack, New Guinea)
2. **Kaya** - Scrapped 1940 (did not serve WWII)
3. **Nashi** - Sunk July 19, 1944 (submarine, off Formosa)
4. **Tsuga** - Sunk June 12, 1944 (air attack, Biak)

**Converted to Patrol Boats (13 ships, 1939-1940):**
Reclassified as Patrol Boat No. 31-38 series:
5. **Kaki** - Patrol Boat 31, sunk August 1943 (submarine)
6. **Kuri** - Patrol Boat 32, sunk August 1944 (submarine)
7. **Nire** - Patrol Boat 33, sunk February 1944 (air attack)
8. **Take** - Patrol Boat 34, survived war, scrapped 1947
9. **Kuwa** - Patrol Boat 35, sunk May 1943 (air attack)
10. **Hagi** - Patrol Boat 36, survived war, scrapped 1947
11. **Susuki** - Patrol Boat 37, sunk January 1945 (submarine)
12. **Hishi** - Patrol Boat 38, sunk May 1945 (air attack)
13-17. **Others** - Various patrol boat conversions, most lost

**Scrapped Before WWII (4 ships, 1939-1940):**
18-21. **Various** - Scrapped as obsolete

**WWII Combat Service:**

**Momi - December 5, 1942:**
- Convoy escort New Guinea
- **Attacked by Allied bombers**
- Hit by bombs
- Sank off New Guinea coast
- Heavy casualties for small crew

**Tsuga - June 12, 1944:**
- At Biak, New Guinea
- **Attacked by US Army Air Forces**
- Hit by bombs
- Sank in harbor
- Most crew killed

**Nashi - July 19, 1944:**
- Convoy escort off Formosa
- **Torpedoed by US submarine**
- Small size meant limited survivability
- Sank rapidly
- High casualties

**Patrol Boat Service:**

**Why Converted (1939-1940):**
- Too small, too old for destroyer service
- Still useful for coastal patrol
- Removed from destroyer list
- Redesignated Patrol Boat No. 31-38
- Reduced armament, patrol duties

**Patrol Boat Losses (9 of 13 lost):**
Most lost to submarines and air attack:
- 5 to submarines
- 4 to air attack
- Small size, light AA made them vulnerable

**Loss Statistics (21 ships total):**
- **WWII destroyer service:** 4 ships, 4 lost (100%)
- **Patrol boat conversion:** 13 ships, 9 lost (69%)
- **Pre-war scrapping:** 4 ships
- **Overall WWII losses:** 13 of 17 in service (76%)
- **Survived war:** 4 ships (2 patrol boats, 2 scrapped pre-war)

**Why So Small:**
**WWI Context (1918-1920):**
- Rapid destroyer production needed
- Simplified, reduced design
- Quantity over quality
- Emergency war construction
- Low cost per unit

**Result:**
- 21 ships built quickly
- But too small for sustained operations
- Obsolete within 10-15 years

**120mm/45 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as other small destroyers
- **Caliber:** 120mm (4.7 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 15,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 8-10 rounds per minute
- Only 3 guns (minimal for destroyer)

**Comparison - Small Destroyers:**
| Class | Displacement | Main Guns | Torpedoes | Speed | Ships Built |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Momi** | **850 tons** | **3× 4.7"** | **4× 21"** | **36 kn** | **21** |
| Kamikaze | 1,270 tons | 4× 4.7" | 6× 21" | 37 kn | 9 |
| Minekaze | 1,215 tons | 4× 4.7" | 6× 21" | 39 kn | 15 |
| Mutsuki | 1,315 tons | 4× 4.7" | 6× 21" | 37 kn | 12 |

**Momi significantly smaller** - 400+ tons less than next smallest class

**Why Most Converted to Patrol Boats:**

**By 1939:**
1. **Too small:** 850 tons inadequate for modern destroyer
2. **Too weak:** 3 guns insufficient
3. **Too old:** 18-20 years old
4. **Still useful:** Patrol, escort, ASW capable
5. **Fleet needs:** Real destroyers needed at sea, these for coastal

**Result:** 13 converted to patrol boats, retained utility without pretending to be combat destroyers

**Tactical Employment (WWII):**

**4 Destroyer-Designated Ships:**
- Convoy escort (short range)
- Coastal patrol
- ASW patrols
- Local defense
- **Not used for fleet operations** (too small, too old)

**13 Patrol Boats:**
- Coastal defense
- Harbor patrol
- ASW patrols
- Convoy escort (local)
- Minesweeping (some)

**Legacy:** Momi-class represented WWI emergency construction - 21 tiny destroyers (850 tons) built quickly 1920-1922. Too small for sustained service - most converted to patrol boats (1939-1940) or scrapped. Only 4 retained as destroyers for WWII, all 4 lost (100% destroyer loss rate). 13 patrol boat conversions: 9 lost (69%). Smallest destroyers in IJN WWII service. Showed emergency wartime construction produces compromised designs. 18-20 years later (WWII), obsolete but still died trying. Names: Trees and plants (Momi=Fir, Kaya=Nutmeg, Nashi=Pear, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Momi-class epitomized WWI quantity-over-quality thinking. 21 tiny destroyers (850 tons - barely destroyer size) built rapidly 1920-1922. Within 18 years (1939), most obsolete - 13 converted to patrol boats, 4 scrapped. Only 4 served WWII as destroyers, all 4 lost (smallest combatants pressed into service from desperation). Patrol boat conversions fared better but still 69% loss rate. Showed that emergency compromises produce short-lived designs. By WWII, 850-ton "destroyers" absurdly small - but Japan used them anyway from necessity. Overall 76% wartime loss rate across all that served. Last 2 patrol boats survived to 1947 scrapping. Represented WWI crisis designs outliving usefulness, dying in next war.
