**Ultimate Battleship That Never Was** - A-150 (Design A-150) was Japan's planned super-battleship. Design studies 1938-1941. Would have been largest battleships ever built: 98,000 tons full (vs Yamato's 72,800 tons). **510mm (20.1-inch) guns** - largest battleship guns ever planned! (vs Yamato's 18.1-inch). Six guns in three twin turrets. 16-inch belt, 9-inch deck, 26-inch turret faces. 30 knots, 190,000 shp. Never laid down - cancelled due to war priorities (shift to carrier warfare after Midway 1942, resources diverted to carriers/aircraft). Design studies only (preliminary plans, no construction). Symbol of battleship era's end - ultimate battleship concept obsolete before it could be built. A-150: Greatest "what-if" in naval history.

**Key Specs (Planned):** 91,000/98,000 tons | 925ft | 30 kn | **6× 20.1-inch guns** | **NEVER BUILT**

**Innovation:** **Most ambitious battleship design ever** (1938-1941). Larger than Yamato (98,000 tons vs 72,800), larger than Iowa (58,000 tons), larger than Bismarck (50,300 tons) - **largest battleship ever planned!** Revolutionary armament: **510mm (20.1-inch) 45-caliber guns** (vs Yamato 18.1-inch, Iowa 16-inch, Bismarck 15-inch) - **largest battleship guns ever planned!** Three twin turrets (3×2 = 6 guns total). Estimated shell weight: 3,350 lbs (vs Yamato 3,219 lbs, Iowa 2,700 lbs). Estimated range: 45,000 meters (vs Yamato 42,000m). **Heavy armor**: 16-inch VH belt (Yamato 16.1-inch - similar), 9-inch deck (Yamato 7.9-inch - **thicker**), **26-inch turret faces** (Yamato 25.6-inch - slightly more). **Speed**: 30 knots maintained (190,000 shp vs Yamato 150,000 shp = 27% more power). **Size**: 925 ft long (vs Yamato 863 ft), 128 ft beam (vs Yamato 121 ft). **Purpose**: Counter any enemy battleship (including future US/UK designs), ultimate fleet flagship, decisive battle weapon (decisive battle doctrine). **Design studies only**: Preliminary plans (1938-1941), no detailed blueprints, no construction started, **cancelled** before laid down.

**Design (Preliminary/Theoretical):**

**Hull:**
- Massive battleship hull: 925 ft long, 128 ft beam, 36 ft draft
- 91,000 tons standard, **98,000 tons full** (largest ever planned!)
- Reinforced structure (support massive turrets, absorb recoil)
- Four shafts (vs Yamato's 4 - same configuration)
- Bulbous bow (hydrodynamic efficiency)
- Extensive compartmentalization (damage control)

**Armament:**
- **6× 510mm (20.1-inch) 45-caliber guns**:
  - Three twin turrets (2 forward, 1 aft - standard layout)
  - Largest battleship guns ever planned
  - Estimated performance:
    - Shell weight: ~3,350 lbs
    - Muzzle velocity: ~2,560 ft/s
    - Maximum range: ~45,000 meters (29 miles!)
    - Rate of fire: ~1.5 rounds/minute
    - Penetration: ~18-20 inches of armor at 20,000 meters
  - Could penetrate any battleship armor at combat ranges
- **18× 100mm (3.9-inch) Type 98 DP guns**: Dual-purpose (anti-air, anti-surface)
- **12× 127mm AA guns**: Additional air defense
- **Extensive 25mm AA batteries**: Close-in defense (planned 100+ guns)
- **Fire control**: Type 98 (advanced for era), optical/radar rangefinders

**Armor:**
- **16-inch VH belt**: Main waterline armor (Vickers Hardened - hardest steel)
- **9-inch armored deck**: Protection against plunging fire (thicker than Yamato!)
- **26-inch turret faces**: Protect main battery (thickest ever planned!)
- **20-inch conning tower**: Admiral/captain protected
- Torpedo bulges: Extensive underwater protection
- Total armor weight: ~35,000 tons (35% of displacement!)

**Propulsion:**
- Four sets of steam turbines
- 190,000 shaft horsepower (enormous - 27% more than Yamato!)
- Four shafts (quad screws)
- 12 boilers (estimated - oil-fired Kampon type)
- **30 knots maximum** (despite massive size!)
- Range: ~8,000 nm at 16 knots (estimated - similar to Yamato)

**Crew:**
- Estimated ~2,500 officers/men (vs Yamato 2,750 - similar)
- Large crew (complex systems, manual operations 1940s)

**Profile (If Built):**
- Three massive turrets (20.1-inch guns - larger than Yamato's!)
- Huge superstructure (pagoda-style command tower)
- Two funnels (massive boiler uptakes)
- Extensive AA guns (bristling with 25mm mounts)
- Imposing, powerful-looking (largest battleship ever)

**Development History:**

**1937-1938 (Initial Concept):**
- Yamato-class laid down 1937 (Yamato), 1938 (Musashi)
- Japanese Naval General Staff already thinking beyond Yamato
- **Question**: "What if US/UK build bigger battleships?"
- **Answer**: Design even larger battleship (A-150)

**1938-1939 (Design Studies):**
- Multiple design iterations (A-140 → A-150 series)
- **Goals**:
  1. Guns larger than Yamato (20-inch vs 18.1-inch)
  2. Speed maintained (30 knots)
  3. Armor superior to Yamato
  4. Size: Whatever needed to achieve above
- **Results**:
  - A-150 design: 98,000 tons, 6× 510mm guns
  - Massive resources required (steel, engines, guns)
  - Estimated cost: 50% more than Yamato (~¥200+ million)

**1940-1941 (Planning Stage):**
- Fourth Fleet Replenishment Program (1940): A-150 proposed
- **Issues**:
  1. **Resources**: Japan's industrial capacity strained (already building Yamato/Musashi/Shinano)
  2. **Dockyards**: Few yards large enough (only Kure, Yokosuka could handle)
  3. **Time**: 4-5 years to build (vs 3-4 for Yamato)
  4. **Cost**: Enormous (equivalent to 3-4 carriers or 10+ destroyers)
  5. **Utility**: Would such a massive ship be worth it?
- **Decision**: Postponed (focus on completing Yamato/Musashi first)

**December 1941 (War Begins):**
- Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941)
- Carriers proved decisive (sank battleships at Pearl Harbor)
- But: Battleship advocates still powerful (A-150 still considered)

**June 1942 (Midway - Turning Point):**
- Battle of Midway (June 4-7, 1942)
- Japan lost 4 carriers (Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu)
- **Decisive**: Carriers are future of naval warfare
- **A-150 cancelled**: Resources diverted to:
  - Shinano (convert third Yamato to carrier)
  - Taiho-class carriers (armored fleet carriers)
  - Unryu-class carriers (rapid construction)
  - Aircraft production
  - Submarines

**1942-1945 (Never Built):**
- A-150 design studies filed away
- No construction ever started (not even keel laid)
- Japan's focus: Carriers, aircraft, defensive operations
- By 1944: Japan losing war, desperate for materiel
- A-150: Forgotten project, obsolete concept

**Why Cancelled:**

**1. Carrier Warfare Dominance:**
- Midway (June 1942): Carriers destroyed Japanese carrier fleet
- Battleships mostly ineffective WWII (Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Midway - all carrier battles)
- A-150 obsolete before built (like building dinosaur in jet age)

**2. Resource Constraints:**
- **Steel**: 98,000 tons steel for one battleship vs:
  - 10-12 destroyers (10,000 tons each)
  - 3-4 carriers (25,000 tons each)
  - 20+ submarines (5,000 tons each)
- Better return: Many ships vs one super-battleship
- Japan's steel production limited (imports cut off by 1943)

**3. Dockyard Limitations:**
- Only Kure, Yokosuka could build A-150 (massive slipways needed)
- Those yards needed for: Repairs, conversions, other construction
- 4-5 years building A-150 vs 2-3 years for carriers = opportunity cost

**4. Time:**
- Start 1941 → complete 1945-1946 (if no delays)
- By then: War over (Japan surrendered August 1945)
- Even if built 1944: US air superiority would sink it (Yamato sunk April 1945 by 400+ aircraft)

**5. Strategic Shift:**
- 1941-1942: Offensive war (battleships for fleet battles)
- 1943-1945: Defensive war (carriers for defense, aircraft for home islands)
- A-150 designed for offensive decisive battle (obsolete strategy by 1943)

**6. Yamato's Fate:**
- Yamato: Built, but rarely used (fuel shortage, air threat)
- Most powerful battleship ever built, but:
  - Only fired main guns in anger once (Battle off Samar, October 1944)
  - Sunk by aircraft April 7, 1945 (Operation Ten-Go)
  - Proved: Even greatest battleship helpless against massed air attack
- A-150 would have suffered same fate (larger target, same vulnerability)

**Comparison - Largest Battleships (Built and Planned):**

| Ship | Nation | Status | Tons | Length | Guns | Armor (Belt) | Speed |
|------|--------|--------|------|--------|------|--------------|-------|
| **A-150** | **Japan** | **Planned** | **98,000** | **925 ft** | **6× 20.1-inch** | **16 inches** | **30 kn** |
| Yamato | Japan | Built | 72,800 | 863 ft | 9× 18.1-inch | 16.1 inches | 27 kn |
| Montana | USA | Planned | 70,965 | 921 ft | 12× 16-inch | 16.1 inches | 28 kn |
| Iowa | USA | Built | 58,000 | 887 ft | 9× 16-inch | 12.1 inches | 33 kn |
| H-44 | Germany | Planned | 141,500 | 1,090 ft | 8× 20-inch | 15 inches | 30 kn |
| Vanguard | UK | Built | 51,420 | 814 ft | 8× 15-inch | 14 inches | 30 kn |

**A-150 Characteristics:**
- **Second-largest planned** (only German H-44 bigger - even more fantastical)
- **Largest Japanese battleship planned** (35% bigger than Yamato!)
- **Largest guns planned for production design** (H-44 paper study, A-150 serious design)
- **Never built** (unlike Yamato, unlike Montana which was laid down then cancelled)

**20.1-inch Guns - Largest Ever:**

**Comparison - Battleship Main Guns:**
- **A-150**: 510mm (20.1 inches) - LARGEST PLANNED
- Yamato: 460mm (18.1 inches) - largest built
- Iowa: 406mm (16 inches) - US standard
- Bismarck: 380mm (15 inches) - German standard
- HMS Vanguard: 381mm (15 inches) - UK standard

**Why 20.1-inch:**
- **Arms race logic**: Bigger than anyone else
- **Decisive battle doctrine**: One shot to cripple enemy battleship
- **Penetration**: Punch through any armor (including Yamato-class armor!)
- **Psychological**: "Our guns bigger than yours" (intimidation)
- **Reality**: Diminishing returns (20-inch vs 18.1-inch marginal improvement, massive cost/weight increase)

**If Built - Estimated Performance:**
- Shell weight: ~3,350 lbs (50 lbs more than Yamato)
- Range: ~45,000 meters (3,000m more than Yamato)
- Penetration: ~20 inches of armor at 20,000 meters (vs Yamato 18 inches)
- Rate of fire: ~1.5 rounds/minute (slower than smaller guns)
- **Problem**: Diminishing returns (marginal improvement, huge cost)

**"What-If" Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: A-150 Built (1941-1945):**
- Laid down: 1941 (instead of Shinano conversion)
- Completed: 1944-1945
- **Likely fate**:
  - Fuel shortage (Japan's oil imports cut off 1942+)
  - Docked at Kure/Yokosuka (can't operate without fuel)
  - Bombed by B-29s at moorings (Yamato damaged at Kure 1945)
  - OR: Sortied in desperation (like Yamato April 1945)
  - Sunk by US carrier aircraft (400+ planes)
- **Outcome**: Wasted resources, same result as Yamato

**Scenario 2: Multiple A-150s (Fantasy):**
- If Japan built 2-3 A-150s (like Yamato/Musashi/Shinano)
- **Resources**: Would have bankrupted Japan (equivalent to 50+ destroyers)
- **Time**: 10-15 years to build all three (war over before completion)
- **Utility**: Still vulnerable to aircraft (size = bigger target)
- **Outcome**: Even bigger waste

**Scenario 3: A-150 vs Iowa/Montana:**
- If A-150 fought US battleships (hypothetical surface battle)
- **Advantages**: Heavier guns (20.1-inch vs 16-inch), heavier armor
- **Disadvantages**: Slower (30 kn vs Iowa 33 kn), larger target, worse fire control (US radar superior)
- **Likely outcome**: A-150 wins at long range (bigger guns), but:
  - US air superiority means battle never happens (bombed before engagement)
  - Or: US submarines sink A-150 (large, slow target)

**Scenario 4: A-150 Preserved (Alternate History):**
- If built and survived war (fantasy)
- **Too large to preserve**: 98,000 tons (dock/maintenance impossible)
- Likely: Scrapped like other battleships (too expensive to maintain)
- But: Would have been greatest museum ship ever!

**Symbol of Battleship Era's End:**

**Irony:**
- A-150: Ultimate battleship (largest, most powerful ever planned)
- **Never built** because battleships obsolete (carrier age)
- Design studies 1938-1941 (peak battleship era)
- Cancelled 1942 (after Midway - carriers proved superior)

**Battleship Evolution:**
- Dreadnought (1906): Revolutionized battleship design
- Super-dreadnoughts (WWI): Larger, more guns
- Treaty battleships (1920s-1930s): Constrained by Washington/London Treaties
- Fast battleships (1930s-1940s): Speed + firepower (Iowa, Yamato)
- **A-150**: Ultimate evolution - largest, most powerful
- **But**: Evolution ended (carriers replaced battleships)

**Comparison - Obsolete Before Built:**
- A-150 (battleship, cancelled 1942)
- German H-class (battleships, cancelled 1940)
- British Lion-class (battleships, suspended 1945)
- US Montana-class (battleship, cancelled 1943)
- **All cancelled**: Battleship age over, carrier age begun

**Legacy:** A-150 was Japan's ultimate battleship that never was. Design studies 1938-1941 (preliminary plans only). Would have been largest battleship ever built: 98,000 tons full (35% bigger than Yamato!). **510mm (20.1-inch) guns** - largest battleship guns ever planned! Six guns, 30 knots, heavy armor (16-inch belt, 9-inch deck, 26-inch turrets). Never laid down - cancelled 1942 (after Midway, shift to carrier warfare). Resources diverted to carriers, aircraft. Symbol of battleship era's end - ultimate battleship obsolete before it could be built. "What-if" that represents peak of battleship evolution and its obsolescence. A-150: Greatest naval "what-if" in history.

**Historical Significance:** A-150 represents battleship concept's ultimate expression and its futility. 1930s: Arms race (Japan vs US vs UK), each trying to build bigger battleships. Washington/London Naval Treaties (1922-1936) limited size, Japan withdrew from treaties 1936 (free to build). Yamato-class (1937-1941): Secret super-battleships (18.1-inch guns, 72,800 tons). But: **Why stop there?** A-150: Logic of arms race taken to extreme (20.1-inch guns, 98,000 tons). Embodied Japanese "decisive battle" doctrine: Build ultimate weapon, seek decisive fleet engagement, crush enemy in single battle. **Problem**: WWII proved doctrine obsolete. Pearl Harbor (December 1941): Carriers destroyed US battleships (battleships helpless against air attack). Coral Sea (May 1942): First carrier battle (battleships not even present). **Midway (June 1942)**: Carriers decided fate of Pacific (Japan lost 4 carriers, US Navy gained superiority). A-150 cancelled: Resources to carriers, not battleships. **Irony**: Yamato (ultimate battleship built) rarely used, sunk by aircraft April 1945 (Operation Ten-Go - 400+ planes). A-150 would have suffered same fate (larger = bigger target). Comparison: US cancelled Montana-class (70,965 tons, 12× 16-inch) same reason - carrier age. Germany cancelled H-class (even more fantastical - 141,500 tons!). UK suspended Lion-class. All nations: Realized battleships obsolete. A-150: Perfect symbol - most powerful weapon imaginable, completely irrelevant. Modern equivalent: Building bigger tank when drones/missiles dominate battlefield. **Legacy**: Reminder that military technology evolves, yesterday's ultimate weapon is today's dinosaur. A-150: Magnificent obsession that never was, symbol of era that ended before ship could be built.
