**First 16-Inch Guns** - Nagato-class were world's first battleships with 16-inch guns. 2 ships built 1920-1921. Fast battleships (26.5 knots). Served WWI through WWII. Extensively modernized 1930s. Nagato survived war, sunk at Bikini Atoll atomic tests 1946.

**Key Specs:** 32,720/39,130 tons | 738ft | 26.5 kn | 8× 41cm (16.1") + 20× 140mm | 305mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** World's first 16-inch gun battleships (beat US Colorado-class and UK Nelson-class by 2-3 years). Combined heavy firepower with high speed (26.5 knots). Advanced fire control. All-oil fired boilers from 1924 refit. Represented Japan's emergence as leading naval power.

**Design:** Eight 41cm guns in four twin turrets (superfiring fore and aft). Clipper bow. Distinctive pagoda mast (added in 1930s modernizations). Well-protected against 14-16 inch shells. Good sea-keeping. Excellent range. Modernized twice (1934-1936 and 1941).

**Ships:**
- **Nagato** - Flagship 1942-1944, survived WWII, sunk July 29, 1946 (Operation Crossroads nuclear test, Bikini Atoll)
- **Mutsu** - Magazine explosion June 8, 1943 (Hashirajima), 1,121 killed, sabotage suspected, wreck partially salvaged

**Construction:**
- **Nagato:** Kure Naval Arsenal, laid down August 28, 1917, launched November 9, 1919, commissioned November 25, 1920
- **Mutsu:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, laid down June 1, 1918, launched May 31, 1920, commissioned October 24, 1921

**Modernizations:**
1. **1924-1925:** Converted from mixed coal/oil to all-oil firing
2. **1934-1936 (Major):**
   - Bulges added (increased beam to 113 ft)
   - Horizontal armor increased (bomb protection)
   - Pagoda mast enlarged
   - Boilers replaced, funnel trunked backwards
   - AA guns added
   - Aircraft catapult installed
3. **1941 (Emergency):**
   - Heavy AA added (25mm mounts)
   - Fire control upgraded

**Service:**
- **Nagato (1920-1946):**
  - Fleet flagship 1920s-1930s
  - Combined Fleet flagship (1942-1944)
  - Battle of Midway (June 1942) - Yamamoto's flagship, did not engage
  - Battle of Philippine Sea (June 1944) - minimal action
  - Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944) - Battle off Samar, damaged
  - Survived war largely intact
  - **Operation Crossroads** (July 1946) - Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests, survived Test Able, sank Test Baker

- **Mutsu (1921-1943):**
  - Fleet training and reserve 1920s-1930s
  - **June 8, 1943:** Catastrophic magazine explosion at Hashirajima anchorage
  - Sank in minutes, 1,121 killed (353 survivors)
  - Cause debated: sabotage, unstable propellant, or accident
  - Wreck partially salvaged 1970s

**41cm/45 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 410mm (16.1 inches)
- **Barrel length:** 18.9 meters (62 feet)
- **Shell weight:** Type 88 AP: 1,020 kg (2,249 lbs) | Type 0 HE: 1,000 kg (2,205 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 790 m/s (2,592 ft/s)
- **Maximum range:** 38,430 meters (42,020 yards / 23.9 miles)
- **Rate of fire:** 1.5-2 rounds per minute
- **Barrel life:** 200-250 rounds

**Armor Protection (Post-1936):**
- **Belt:** 305mm (12") main belt, angled
- **Deck:** 70-127mm (2.75-5") increased in 1930s modernization
- **Turrets:** 300mm (11.8") face, 230mm sides, 114mm roof
- **Barbettes:** 305mm (12")
- **Conning tower:** 368mm (14.5")
- **Bulges:** Added 1934-1936 for torpedo protection

**Combat Record:**
- **Nagato:** Battle off Samar (Oct 25, 1944) - hit USS White Plains, near-missed escort carriers
- Limited combat due to fuel shortages 1944-1945
- Used as floating AA battery Yokosuka late 1945
- Survived war - last surviving IJN capital ship

**Legacy:** Symbol of IJN power 1920s-1930s. First 16-inch gun battleships gave Japan technical lead. Pagoda mast became iconic IJN silhouette. Mutsu tragedy shocked nation. Nagato survived war - only IJN capital ship to do so. Operation Crossroads made Nagato internationally famous - filmed sinking in atomic blast. Wreck remains at Bikini Atoll (underwater radiation hazard).

**Historical Significance:** Treaty loophole - commissioned just before Washington Naval Treaty (1922) limiting battleships. Japan stopped work on planned sisters to comply with treaty. Design influenced all subsequent IJN battleships. Represented Japan's ambition to build world's most powerful navy. Nagato as Yamamoto's flagship at Midway symbolizes IJN at peak power. Sinking in atomic test symbolizes end of battleship era.
