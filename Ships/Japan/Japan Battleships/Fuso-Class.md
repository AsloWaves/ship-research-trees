**Pagoda Mast Battleships** - Fuso-class were first Japanese super-dreadnoughts. 2 ships built 1915. Twelve 14-inch guns (six twin turrets, all centerline). Famous for distinctive tall pagoda masts after 1930s modernization. Both sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Surigao Strait) - last battleship vs battleship action in history.

**Key Specs:** 34,700/39,154 tons | 708ft | 24.7 kn | 12× 356mm (14") + 14× 152mm + 104× 25mm AA | 305mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese super-dreadnoughts - twelve 14-inch guns surpassed contemporary foreign battleships. All six turrets on centerline (no wing turrets like Dreadnought). Amidships turret arrangement (3 forward, 3 aft). Distinctive tall pagoda masts after 1933-1935 modernization - most recognizable IJN battleship silhouette. Last battleships sunk in surface gun action in history (Surigao Strait).

**Design:** Twelve 14-inch guns in six twin turrets - unique arrangement with middle turret superfiring over forward turret. All centerline mounts (no wing turrets). After 1933-1935 modernization: massive pagoda mast forward (tallest in IJN), lengthened hull, new boilers, anti-torpedo bulges, increased armor. Well-armored against 14-inch shells. Good range after modernization.

**Ships:**
- **Fuso** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Surigao Strait), magazine explosion, broke in two, 1,620 killed (10 survivors)
- **Yamashiro** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Surigao Strait), capsized after torpedo hits, 1,636 killed (10 survivors)

**Construction:**
- **Fuso:** Kure Naval Arsenal, laid down March 11, 1912, launched March 28, 1914, commissioned November 18, 1915
- **Yamashiro:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, laid down November 20, 1913, launched November 3, 1915, commissioned March 31, 1917

**Modernizations:**
1. **1922-1924:** Increased elevation of main guns (43°), extended range
2. **1930-1933 (Fuso) / 1930-1935 (Yamashiro) - Major Reconstruction:**
   - Hull lengthened 26 feet
   - Massive pagoda mast built forward
   - All boilers replaced (oil-fired, increased to 24 boilers)
   - New turbines (75,000 shp)
   - Anti-torpedo bulges added
   - Horizontal armor increased (bomb protection)
   - Secondary armament modified
   - Aircraft catapult installed
   - Cost: Nearly as much as new battleship

**Service:**
- **Fuso (1915-1944):**
  - WWI: Limited patrol duties
  - 1920s-1930s: Training, fleet operations
  - 1930-1933: Major modernization
  - 1937-1941: China operations, training
  - WWII (1941-1942): Limited operations due to age
  - Battle of Midway (June 1942): Support force, did not engage
  - 1943-1944: Training, conserved due to fuel shortages
  - **October 25, 1944:** Battle of Surigao Strait

- **Yamashiro (1917-1944):**
  - WWI: Too late for combat
  - 1920s-1930s: Training, fleet operations
  - 1930-1935: Major modernization
  - 1937-1941: China operations
  - WWII: Limited operations
  - Battle of Midway: Support force
  - **October 25, 1944:** Battle of Surigao Strait

**Battle of Surigao Strait (October 24-25, 1944):**
*Last battleship vs battleship action in history*

**Background:**
- Part of Battle of Leyte Gulf
- Admiral Nishimura's Southern Force (Fuso, Yamashiro, heavy cruiser Mogami, 4 destroyers)
- Mission: Break through Surigao Strait, attack US landing forces at Leyte

**The Battle:**
- **11:30 PM Oct 24:** Southern Force entered Surigao Strait
- **Destroyer torpedo attacks:**
  - Fuso hit by torpedoes, fell out of formation (~2:00 AM Oct 25)
  - Fuso magazine exploded, broke in two, sank at 3:38 AM
  - Only 10 survivors from 1,630 crew
- **Yamashiro continued advance alone:**
  - **3:51 AM:** Crossed the "T" by six US battleships (West Virginia, Maryland, Mississippi, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania)
  - US battleships opened fire at 22,800 yards
  - West Virginia's radar fire control hit Yamashiro immediately
  - Hit by dozens of 14-inch and 16-inch shells
  - Multiple torpedo hits from destroyers
  - **4:19 AM:** Capsized and sank
  - Only 10 survivors from 1,636 crew

**Significance of Surigao Strait:**
1. **Last battleship duel:** Final battleship vs battleship action in naval history
2. **Perfect ambush:** Classic "crossing the T" - US battleships in line, Japanese in column
3. **Radar advantage:** US radar fire control vs Japanese visual targeting at night
4. **Overwhelming force:** 6 US battleships + 8 cruisers + 28 destroyers vs 2 Japanese battleships
5. **Annihilation:** Entire Southern Force destroyed (Mogami sank next day)
6. **Pearl Harbor revenge:** 5 of 6 US battleships were Pearl Harbor survivors (West Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania)

**14-inch/45 Type 41 Gun Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 356mm (14 inches)
- **Barrel length:** 16.2 meters (53.1 feet)
- **Shell weight:** Type 88 AP: 673.5 kg (1,485 lbs) | Type 0 HE: 625 kg (1,378 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 775 m/s (2,543 ft/s)
- **Maximum range:** 35,450 meters (38,770 yards / 22 miles) at 43° elevation
- **Rate of fire:** 2 rounds per minute
- **Penetration:** 310mm (12.2") armor at 20,000 meters

**Armor Protection (Post-1935):**
- **Belt:** 305mm (12") main belt
- **Deck:** 51-114mm (2-4.5") increased in modernization
- **Turrets:** 279mm (11") face, 203mm sides, 114mm roof
- **Barbettes:** 305mm (12")
- **Conning tower:** 305mm (12")
- **Bulges:** Added 1930-1935 for torpedo protection
- **Underwater protection:** Poor compared to later battleships

**Pagoda Masts:**
- **Most distinctive feature** after modernization
- Seven-story tall structure forward
- Multiple platforms for:
  - Bridge and command spaces
  - Fire control directors
  - Rangefinders
  - Searchlights
  - Signal platforms
  - Admiral's bridge
- **Height:** Approximately 120 feet (37 meters) above waterline
- **Weight:** Added significant topweight (stability concern)
- **Visibility:** Excellent command view, but top-heavy
- **Iconic:** Most recognizable IJN battleship silhouette

**Combat Record:**
- Limited combat due to age and speed
- Conserved for "decisive battle" that never came
- **Surigao Strait:** Brave but doomed charge
- Fuso destroyed before engaging US battleships
- Yamashiro fought alone against overwhelming force
- Both crews fought to the end - 20 total survivors from 3,266 crew

**Legacy:** Fuso-class represented transition from dreadnought to super-dreadnought. Distinctive pagoda masts made them instantly recognizable. Surigao Strait was fitting end - last battleship vs battleship action in history. Defeat closed battleship era begun by HMS Dreadnought 1906. Pearl Harbor battleships (5 of 6 US ships at Surigao) had revenge. Yamashiro's solitary charge against six battleships showed courage and futility of IJN by late 1944. Wreck of Fuso discovered 2017 (6,096 meters depth). Wreck of Yamashiro located 2017 (over 6,000 meters depth). Both wrecks show catastrophic damage from magazine explosions and shell hits.

**Historical Significance:** Embodied IJN battleship design philosophy - heavy guns, distinctive superstructures, multiple modernizations. Surigao Strait demonstrated obsolescence of battleships in age of radar and air power, yet showed they could still destroy each other in gun duels. Five US battleships at Surigao were Pearl Harbor survivors - poetic justice. Last time battleships decided battle. Names: "Fuso" from ancient name for Japan, "Yamashiro" from province near Kyoto.
