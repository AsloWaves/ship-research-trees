**Unstable Experiment** - Ryujo was light carrier designed under London Naval Treaty restrictions (under 10,000 tons). Commissioned 1933 with two-tier hangars - dangerously top-heavy. Rebuilt 1936 (upper hangar removed). Pearl Harbor veteran (China operations). Sunk at Battle of Eastern Solomons August 24, 1942 - first IJN carrier lost after Midway.

**Key Specs:** 10,600/12,732 tons | 590ft | 29 kn | 37-48 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 24× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Designed to exploit London Naval Treaty loophole - light carriers under 10,000 tons not counted toward carrier tonnage limits. Two-tier hangar maximized aircraft capacity but made ship dangerously unstable. Rebuild proved light carriers needed single hangar. Influenced Zuiho-class design (learned from Ryujo's mistakes). Demonstrated limits of treaty circumvention - stability cannot be sacrificed for capacity.

**Design (As Built 1933):** Two full hangars (upper and lower) to maximize aircraft. Small island starboard. Flight deck 590 ft. Top-heavy and unstable - poor seakeeping, heavy rolling. Treaty displacement (under 10,000 tons) inadequate for two hangars. Eight 5-inch DP guns. Good speed (29 knots). Light structure for weight savings. Dangerous in heavy seas.

**Design (After 1936 Rebuild):** Upper hangar removed, flight deck lowered. Single hangar only. Better stability but reduced aircraft capacity (48 → 37). Displacement increased to 10,600 tons. Still light carrier by fleet standards. Improved seakeeping. More practical design. Ballast added for stability.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- Laid down: November 26, 1929
- Launched: April 2, 1931
- Commissioned: May 9, 1933
- Rebuilt: 1934-1936 (stability improvements)
- Cost: 23 million yen

**Service:**
- **1933-1937:** Training, fleet exercises, stability issues discovered
- **1934-1936:** Major rebuild (upper hangar removed)
- **1937-1941:** China operations, combat experience
- **December 1941:** Supported Philippines invasion (Davao)
- **January-April 1942:** Dutch East Indies operations
- **June 1942:** Aleutians operation (missed Midway)
- **August 1942:** Guadalcanal operations
- **August 24, 1942:** **Battle of Eastern Solomons** - sunk

**Battle of Eastern Solomons (August 24, 1942):**
*First IJN carrier sunk after Midway*

**Background:**
- Part of force supporting Guadalcanal reinforcement
- Combined with Shokaku and Zuikaku (fleet carriers)
- Ryujo designated as "bait" to draw US carriers

**The Battle:**
- **Ryujo strike launched:** 15 aircraft against Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)
- **1:55 PM:** Spotted by US reconnaissance
- **3:00 PM:** Attacked by 38 SBD Dauntless dive bombers and TBF Avenger torpedo bombers from USS Saratoga
- **3:28-3:58 PM:** Hit by 3-5 bombs and 1 torpedo
- Flight deck wrecked, fires erupted
- Hangar explosions, aviation fuel fires
- Dead in water, listing heavily
- **6:00 PM:** Capsized and sank
- **135 killed, 789 survivors**

**Aircraft Complement (1942):**
- 16× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 21× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- **Total:** 37 operational aircraft

**China Operations (1937-1941):**
- Supported IJN operations in China
- Air strikes against Chinese positions
- Escort for troop convoys
- Limited opposition (Chinese air force weak)
- Valuable combat experience for pilots and crew

**Philippines/Dutch East Indies (1941-1942):**
- Supported landings at Davao (December 1941)
- Dutch East Indies operations (January-March 1942)
- Air support for amphibious assaults
- Convoy escort
- Light opposition, successful operations

**Aleutians Operation (June 1942):**
- Missed Battle of Midway (assigned to Aleutians with Junyo)
- Supported invasions of Attu and Kiska
- No carrier opposition
- Diversionary operation while main force attacked Midway

**Stability Issues:**
- **Original design:** Two hangars, dangerously top-heavy
- **Problems:** Heavy rolling, poor seakeeping, limited stability
- **Causes:** Treaty displacement limits inadequate for two-tier design
- **Solution:** 1934-1936 rebuild - upper hangar removed
- **Result:** Stable but reduced aircraft capacity
- **Lesson:** Light carriers needed single hangar - influenced Zuiho-class

**Loss Analysis:**
- Used as "bait" at Eastern Solomons - intentionally exposed
- Sacrificed to allow Shokaku/Zuikaku to strike US carriers
- Vulnerable light carrier against fleet carrier aircraft
- Unarmored design meant rapid destruction
- Similar fate to Soryu at Midway - bombs penetrated hangars
- Fire suppression inadequate
- Light structure meant less survivability than fleet carriers

**Comparison - Light Carrier Losses:**
| Carrier | Tonnage | Aircraft | Battle | Time to Sink | Cause |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Ryujo** | **10,600** | **37** | **E. Solomons** | **~3 hours** | **Bombs/torpedo** |
| Shoho | 11,262 | 30 | Coral Sea | 30 minutes | Bombs/torpedoes |
| Zuiho | 11,262 | 30 | Cape Engano | Scuttled | Bombs/torpedoes |

**Legacy:** Ryujo demonstrated limitations of treaty-circumventing designs. Two-tier hangar experiment failed - stability essential. Rebuild improved ship but reduced capability. Combat record showed light carriers useful for secondary operations but vulnerable in fleet actions. Eastern Solomons loss showed risk of using light carriers as bait. Design flaws influenced later carriers - single hangars prioritized. Name means "Prancing Dragon." First IJN carrier lost after Midway (August 1942) - started carrier attrition that continued to war's end.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Maximize aircraft capacity on treaty displacement
- Two-tier hangar to compete with fleet carriers
- Light construction for weight savings
- Speed prioritized (29 knots)
- No armor (typical light carrier approach)
- Exploit treaty loophole - under 10,000 tons

**Treaty Context:**
- **London Naval Treaty (1930):** Light carriers under 10,000 tons not counted toward limits
- **Japanese strategy:** Build multiple light carriers for flexibility
- **Ryujo result:** Proved 10,000 tons inadequate for two hangars
- **Lesson learned:** Later light carriers (Zuiho, Shoho) designed with single hangar
- **Treaty expired 1936:** Japan withdrew, but design lessons remained

**Historical Significance:** Ryujo represented IJN experimentation with treaty loopholes. Two-tier hangar failure taught important design lessons. Combat experience in China prepared pilots for Pacific War. Eastern Solomons showed vulnerability of light carriers in fleet actions. Used as bait - deliberate sacrifice for tactical advantage. Loss began carrier attrition after Midway. Design influenced later light carriers - Zuiho-class learned from Ryujo's mistakes. Demonstrated that naval treaties drove design compromises that affected combat effectiveness.
