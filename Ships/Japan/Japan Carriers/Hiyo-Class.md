**Converted Liners** - Hiyo-class were fleet carriers converted from ocean liner hulls. 2 ships commissioned 1942. 719 ft, 53 aircraft. Slower than fleet carriers (25.5 knots) due to merchant machinery. Both participated in all major 1942-1944 carrier battles. Hiyo sunk June 1944 (Philippine Sea) from torpedoes. Junyo survived war damaged, scrapped 1947.

**Key Specs:** 24,140/27,500 tons | 719ft | 25.5 kn | 53 aircraft | 12× 127mm DP + 24-96× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Converted from ocean liner hulls (originally intended as luxury liners Kashiwara Maru and Izumo Maru). Merchant-type machinery retained - limited speed (25.5 knots vs 30+ for fleet carriers). Quick conversion (1940-1942). Good range (10,000 nm). Both saw extensive combat 1942-1944. Junyo survived war (only Pearl Harbor-era fleet carrier to do so besides Enterprise). Represented creative use of available hulls to expand carrier fleet after Midway losses.

**Design:** Converted during construction from ocean liners. Full-length flight deck (719 ft). Single hangar deck. Island starboard. Two elevators. Merchant steam turbines (limited speed). Unarmored for rapid conversion. Twelve 5-inch DP guns. Heavy light AA (increased to 96× 25mm by 1944). Large fuel capacity from liner design (good range). 53 aircraft capacity - similar to fleet carriers but slower.

**Ships:**
- **Hiyo** - Sunk June 20, 1944 (Battle of Philippine Sea), 250 killed
- **Junyo** - Survived war damaged, scrapped 1947

**Construction:**
- **Hiyo (originally Kashiwara Maru):**
  - Builder: Kawasaki Kobe
  - Laid down: November 20, 1939 (as liner)
  - Conversion ordered: 1940
  - Launched: June 24, 1941
  - Commissioned: July 31, 1942

- **Junyo (originally Izumo Maru):**
  - Builder: Mitsubishi Nagasaki
  - Laid down: March 20, 1939 (as liner)
  - Conversion ordered: 1940
  - Launched: June 26, 1941
  - Commissioned: May 5, 1942

**Service:**
- **Hiyo (July 1942-June 1944):**
  - Training and work-up
  - **October 26, 1942:** Battle of Santa Cruz
  - **June 19-20, 1944:** Battle of Philippine Sea - sunk

- **Junyo (May 1942-August 1945):**
  - **June 1942:** Battle of Midway (arrived too late, no action)
  - **August 24, 1942:** Battle of Eastern Solomons
  - **October 26, 1942:** Battle of Santa Cruz
  - **June 19-20, 1944:** Battle of Philippine Sea (survived damaged)
  - **1944-1945:** Repairs, limited operations
  - **August 1945:** Surrendered intact
  - **1947:** Scrapped

**Battle of Santa Cruz (October 26, 1942):**
*Last Japanese carrier victory*

**Background:**
- US and Japanese carrier forces near Guadalcanal
- Junyo and Hiyo part of Advance Force

**October 26, 1942:**
- Both carriers launched strikes against USS Hornet and Enterprise
- Contributed aircraft to attacks that sank USS Hornet (CV-8)
- Junyo slightly damaged by near-miss bombs
- Hiyo undamaged
- Tactical Japanese victory but unsustainable losses

**Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19-20, 1944):**
*"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"*

**Background:**
- Largest carrier battle of WWII
- Japanese Mobile Fleet: 9 carriers (including Hiyo, Junyo)
- US Task Force 58: 15 carriers

**June 19, 1944:**
- **"Turkey Shoot":** Japanese aircraft massacred by US fighters
- Hiyo and Junyo launched strikes - most aircraft shot down
- Both carriers survived day 1

**June 20, 1944 - Hiyo's Loss:**
**Afternoon:**
- US counterattack - 216 aircraft launched
- **5:20 PM:** Hiyo hit by 2 torpedoes from TBM Avengers (VT-24 from USS Belleau Wood)
- Portside hits near aviation fuel tanks
- Severe flooding began

**Fatal Cascade:**
- **6:00 PM:** Aviation fuel vapor ignited
- Massive internal explosion
- Fire spread throughout ship
- Damage control efforts failed
- **7:00 PM:** Loss of power, dead in water
- **7:32 PM:** Order to abandon ship
- **8:33 PM:** Capsized and sank
- **250 killed, 1,000+ survivors**

**Why Hiyo Sank:**
1. **Torpedo hits:** Ruptured aviation fuel tanks
2. **Fuel vapor:** Accumulated throughout ship
3. **Explosion:** Internal blast destroyed internal structure
4. **Poor damage control:** Couldn't contain flooding/fire
5. **Unarmored hull:** No protection against torpedoes
6. **Conversion design:** Merchant hull not built for combat damage

**Junyo at Philippine Sea:**
- Survived both days
- Aircraft losses heavy
- Ship damaged but operational
- Withdrew with remnants of Mobile Fleet

**Junyo's Later Service:**
- **December 9, 1944:** Torpedoed by USS Sea Devil (submarine)
- Damaged but survived
- Returned to Japan for repairs
- Never fully operational again
- Surrendered intact August 1945
- **Only Pearl Harbor-era IJN fleet carrier to survive war** (besides Enterprise for US)

**Conversion Details:**
**Original Purpose:**
- Luxury ocean liners for NYK Line
- Kashiwara Maru and Izumo Maru
- Construction started 1939

**Conversion Decision (1940):**
- War preparation - carriers needed
- Liners converted during construction
- Hull structure modified
- Flight deck and hangar added
- Merchant turbines retained (limited speed)

**Advantages:**
- Quick conversion (2 years vs 3-4 for purpose-built)
- Good range (liner fuel capacity)
- Large size (24,000 tons)
- Available hulls

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow speed (25.5 knots vs 30+)
- Merchant machinery less reliable
- Unarmored (conversion limitations)
- Less efficient layout

**Aircraft Complement (1942):**
- 21× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 18× D3A1 Val dive bombers
- 18× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- **Total:** 53 operational + spares

**Loss Statistics:**
- **2 built, 1 sunk in combat, 1 survived damaged**
- **Survival rate:** 50% (1 of 2)
- **Junyo:** Only Pearl Harbor-era IJN fleet carrier to survive war

**Comparison - Converted Carriers:**
| Ship | Original | Speed | Aircraft | Fate |
|------|----------|-------|----------|------|
| **Hiyo** | **Ocean liner** | **25.5 kn** | **53** | **Philippine Sea** |
| **Junyo** | **Ocean liner** | **25.5 kn** | **53** | **Survived** |
| Taiyo-class | Liners | 21 kn | 27 | All sunk (escorts) |

**Junyo's Significance:**
- **Only surviving Pearl Harbor-era IJN fleet carrier**
- Participated in 4 major carrier battles
- Outlasted Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu (Midway)
- Outlasted Shokaku, Zuikaku (Philippine Sea)
- Outlasted Hiyo (sister ship)
- Damaged but survived - combination of luck and toughness

**Why Junyo Survived:**
1. **Luck:** Avoided fatal hits in multiple battles
2. **Size:** Larger than light carriers, better survivability
3. **Range:** Could operate from safer positions
4. **Late damage:** December 1944 damage took her out of combat
5. **Repair delays:** Never returned to frontline service

**Legacy:** Hiyo-class demonstrated value of converted carriers. Quick conversion (1940-1942) provided needed carriers after Midway. Both saw extensive combat 1942-1944. Hiyo lost at Philippine Sea to torpedo/fuel vapor explosion. Junyo achieved remarkable survival - only Pearl Harbor-era IJN fleet carrier to survive war. Speed limitation (25.5 knots) was handicap but both performed adequately. Conversion from liners showed Japanese resourcefulness. Junyo's survival unique - outlasted all other IJN carriers from 1941-1942 except one escort carrier. Names: Hiyo (Flying Hawk), Junyo (Peregrine Falcon).

**Historical Significance:** Hiyo-class represented creative solution to carrier shortage. Converted from liners during construction - faster than building from scratch. Both participated in every major carrier battle 1942-1944. Hiyo's loss at Philippine Sea from internal explosion showed continued vulnerability of unarmored carriers. Junyo's survival extraordinary - participated in Santa Cruz, Eastern Solomons, Philippine Sea and survived all. Only Pearl Harbor-era IJN fleet carrier to survive war (remarkable achievement). Showed that converted carriers could perform adequately despite limitations. Speed handicap (25.5 knots) manageable. Junyo's survival provides interesting "what if" - had more carriers survived, could IJN have continued fighting longer? But pilot/aircraft losses more critical than ships.
