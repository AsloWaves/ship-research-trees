**World's First** - Hosho was the first purpose-built aircraft carrier commissioned in the world (December 27, 1922). Designed from keel up as carrier, not conversion. Small (551 ft, 15-21 aircraft) but proved carrier concept. Pearl Harbor veteran (limited role). Survived war, scrapped 1947. Name means "Flying Phoenix."

**Key Specs:** 7,470/9,494 tons | 551ft | 25 kn | 15-21 aircraft | 4× 140mm + 2× 76mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** First purpose-built carrier commissioned in world (HMS Hermes laid down first but commissioned 1924). Proved concept of designing carriers from scratch rather than conversions. Small size validated light carrier concept. Full-length flight deck. Island structure (later removed and reinstalled). Three arresting wires. Influenced all future carrier designs worldwide. Demonstrated that carriers needed dedicated design, not battleship/cruiser conversions.

**Design:** Full-length flight deck (551 ft). Small island starboard (removed 1923, reinstalled 1944). Single hangar deck. Small air group (15-21 aircraft). Triple expansion engines initially (replaced with turbines 1924). Three arresting wires. Forward elevator. Unarmored for speed and aircraft capacity. Four 5.5-inch guns for surface defense. Experimental carrier - many features tested on Hosho.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Asano Shipyard, Tsurumi
- Laid down: December 16, 1919
- Launched: November 13, 1921
- Commissioned: December 27, 1922
- Cost: 8.3 million yen

**Modifications:**
1. **1923:** Island removed (interfered with landing patterns)
2. **1924:** Turbines replaced reciprocating engines
3. **1931:** Bow flight deck extended
4. **1944:** Small island reinstalled for better command/control

**Service:**
- **1922-1937:** Training carrier, pilot development, carrier doctrine experimentation
- **1937-1941:** China operations (limited), primarily training
- **December 7, 1941:** **Pearl Harbor attack** - remained in home waters (too small/slow for Kido Butai)
- **1942:** Training carrier, occasionally forward deployed
- **1943-1945:** Training and transport duties
- **1945:** Survived war intact
- **1947:** Scrapped at Osaka

**Pearl Harbor Role:**
- Did NOT participate in attack (too small, slow, obsolete aircraft)
- Remained in home waters for training
- Six large fleet carriers used instead (Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, Shokaku, Zuikaku)
- Hosho's primary value was training pilots for those six carriers

**WWII Operations:**
- **Training:** Primary role throughout war - trained majority of IJN carrier pilots
- **Limited combat:** Occasionally deployed for transport or support
- **Midway:** Support force, did not engage
- **Battle of Midway:** Too slow for carrier task forces
- **1944-1945:** Reduced to coastal defense and training due to fuel shortages

**Aircraft Complement Evolution:**
- **1922-1930:** 15 aircraft (mix of fighters and torpedo bombers)
- **1930s:** 21 aircraft (A4N fighters, B2M torpedo bombers)
- **1941:** 15 aircraft (A5M Claude fighters, B4Y Jean - obsolete types)
- **1942-1945:** Used primarily for training, not frontline combat aircraft

**Historical Firsts:**
1. **First purpose-built carrier commissioned** (December 27, 1922)
   - HMS Hermes laid down first (1918) but commissioned July 1924
   - Hosho commissioned 18 months before Hermes
2. **First carrier designed from keel as carrier** (not conversion)
3. **First to test modern carrier features:**
   - Full-length flight deck
   - Arresting wires (3 wires)
   - Island structure experiments
   - Elevator systems
4. **Template for light carrier designs** worldwide

**Comparison - Early Carriers:**
| Carrier | Nation | Type | Commissioned | Displacement | Aircraft |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Hosho** | **Japan** | **Purpose-built** | **Dec 1922** | **7,470** | **15-21** |
| HMS Hermes | UK | Purpose-built | July 1924 | 10,850 | 20 |
| USS Langley | USA | Conversion | Mar 1922 | 11,500 | 34 |
| IJN Akagi | Japan | Conversion | Mar 1927 | 36,500 | 60 |

**Training Legacy:**
- Trained thousands of IJN carrier pilots 1922-1945
- Developed carrier landing techniques
- Tested carrier operations doctrine
- Many Pearl Harbor pilots trained on Hosho
- Primary training carrier throughout WWII

**Survival:**
- One of few IJN carriers to survive war
- Too small for major operations, used for training
- Avoided major battles after 1942
- Fuel shortages limited operations 1944-1945
- Surrendered intact August 1945
- Used briefly by occupation forces
- Scrapped 1947 at Osaka

**Legacy:** Hosho proved carrier concept and influenced all future carrier designs. First purpose-built carrier commissioned in world. Small size validated light carrier designs. Training role meant most IJN carrier pilots learned on Hosho - her legacy flew from six Pearl Harbor carriers. Survived war due to training role and small size (not priority target). Historic significance far exceeds combat record. Name "Hosho" (Flying Phoenix) appropriate - carrier aviation rose from this ship. Design influenced worldwide carrier development 1920s-1930s.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Small, affordable carrier for experimentation
- Full-length deck prioritized over hangar space
- Minimal armor for speed
- Surface guns for defense (carriers considered vulnerable 1920s)
- Training platform that could fight if needed
- Proof of concept for purpose-built carriers

**Historical Significance:** Hosho demonstrated that carriers should be designed as carriers from the start, not converted from other hulls. First of its kind - commissioned before HMS Hermes despite later start. Trained the pilots who attacked Pearl Harbor and fought at Midway. Survived war that destroyed most IJN carriers - testament to training role and small size. Influenced carrier design worldwide. Without Hosho, IJN carrier doctrine that dominated 1941-1942 might not have developed. Historic milestone in naval aviation.
