**Converted Tenders** - Shoho-class were light carriers converted from submarine tenders. 2 ships commissioned 1940-1941. 30 aircraft, 28 knots. Quick conversions provided carriers when needed. Shoho sunk at Coral Sea (May 1942) - first Japanese carrier lost, first sunk by carrier aircraft. Zuiho survived until Leyte Gulf (October 1944) - longest-serving early conversion. Both saw extensive combat 1942-1944.

**Key Specs:** 11,262/14,200 tons | 672ft | 28 kn | 30 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 8-30× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Converted from submarine tenders Tsurugisaki and Takasaki. Originally laid down as tenders (1934-1935), converted to carriers before completion (1938-1940). Quick conversion provided needed carriers. 30 aircraft capacity - adequate for light carrier. 28 knots fast enough for fleet operations (unlike escort carriers). Unarmored but functional. Shoho first Japanese carrier sunk in combat (Coral Sea, May 1942). Zuiho survived 2.5 years of intense combat until Leyte Gulf. Showed value of opportunistic conversions.

**Design:** Converted during construction from submarine tenders. Full-length flight deck (672 ft). Single hangar deck. Island starboard. Two elevators. Steam turbines (better than diesel). Eight 5-inch DP guns. Heavy light AA (increased to 30× 25mm by 1944). Unarmored (conversion limitations). 30 aircraft capacity - small but useful. Good range (9,000 nm) from tender design. Fast enough (28 knots) for carrier task forces.

**Ships (2 built - both lost):**
1. **Shoho** (originally Tsurugisaki) - Sunk May 7, 1942 (Battle of Coral Sea), 631 killed
2. **Zuiho** (originally Takasaki) - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Leyte Gulf), 215 killed

*First carrier vs carrier battle - Shoho sunk*

**Background:**
- Japanese invasion of Port Moresby
- US carriers Lexington and Yorktown intercepted
- Shoho covering invasion force

**May 7, 1942:**
**Morning:**
- US scout aircraft located Shoho
- Lexington and Yorktown launched strikes
- **93 aircraft attacked Shoho:**
  - 28 SBD Dauntless dive bombers

- **First Japanese carrier sunk in WWII**
- **First carrier sunk by carrier aircraft in history**

**Lt. Cmdr. Robert Dixon's famous radio call:**
> "Scratch one flattop! Dixon to carrier: Scratch one flattop!"

**Significance:**
- **First Japanese carrier lost**
- **First carrier vs carrier kill**
- Proved carrier aircraft could sink carriers
- US morale boost
- Japan lost light carrier and experienced crew

**Battle of Eastern Solomons (August 24, 1942) - Zuiho:**
- Screening force for Shokaku and Zuikaku
- Launched strikes against US carriers
- Attacked by US dive bombers
- **Hit by single bomb** (minor damage)

- **Hit by two bombs on flight deck**
- Flight deck damaged, couldn't operate aircraft
- Withdrew for repairs
- Survived battle

**Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19-20, 1944) - Zuiho:**
*"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"*
- Part of Japanese Mobile Fleet
- Launched strikes (most shot down)
- Ship survived both days
- Aircraft losses catastrophic
- Withdrew with remnants of fleet

**Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 25, 1944) - Zuiho:**
*Zuiho's last battle*

**Background:**
- **Battle off Cape Engaño** (northern component)
- Zuiho part of decoy force (Ozawa's carriers)
- Mission: Lure US carriers away from Leyte Gulf
- Decoy successful but fatal for carriers

**October 25, 1944:**
**Morning:**
- US carriers launched massive strikes
- 500+ aircraft attacked Japanese carriers

**Zuiho's Ordeal:**
- **First attack (8:00 AM):** Near misses, minor damage
- **Second attack (10:00 AM):** Hit by bombs, fires started
- **Third attack (1:00 PM):** Multiple bomb and torpedo hits
- Flight deck destroyed
- Fires uncontrollable
- Flooding severe

**3:26 PM - Sinking:**
- **Capsized and sank**
- **215 killed, 570+ survivors**
- Destroyer escorts rescued survivors
- Died fulfilling decoy mission

**Why Different Survival Rates:**
**Shoho (May 1942):** 631 killed, 204 survivors (24% survival)
- Rapid sinking (20 minutes)
- Multiple torpedo hits caused immediate flooding
- Less time to abandon ship

**Zuiho (October 1944):** 215 killed, 570+ survivors (73% survival)
- Slower sinking (5+ hours)
- More time to abandon ship
- Escorts nearby for rescue
- Crew prepared for sinking

**Aircraft Complement (1942):**
**Shoho:**
- 12× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 6× D3A1 Val dive bombers
- 12× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- **Total:** 30 operational

**Zuiho (similar):**
- Composition varied by mission
- 30 aircraft total capacity

**Loss Statistics:**
- **2 built, 2 sunk in combat (100% loss rate)**
- **Shoho:** First carrier lost (May 1942)
- **Zuiho:** Longest-surviving early conversion (December 1940 - October 1944, nearly 4 years)
- **Total casualties:** 846 killed, 774 survivors

**Comparison - Light Carriers:**
| Ship | Nation | Displacement | Speed | Aircraft | Fate |
|------|--------|--------------|-------|----------|------|
| **Shoho** | **Japan** | **11,262** | **28 kn** | **30** | **Coral Sea (May 1942)** |
| **Zuiho** | **Japan** | **11,262** | **28 kn** | **30** | **Leyte Gulf (Oct 1944)** |
| Independence-class | USA | 11,000 | 32 kn | 33 | 1 of 9 sunk |
| Ryujo | Japan | 10,600 | 29 kn | 48 | Sunk Aug 1942 |

**Why Shoho Sank So Fast (20 minutes):**
1. **Overkill:** 13 torpedoes + 7 bombs
2. **Light construction:** Unarmored, conversion design
3. **Catastrophic flooding:** Multiple torpedo hits both sides
4. **Small size:** 11,262 tons, limited reserve buoyancy
5. **Fires:** Bomb hits ignited aviation fuel

**Coral Sea's Significance:**
- **First carrier vs carrier battle** in history
- **First carrier sunk by carrier aircraft** (Shoho)
- Tactical Japanese victory (sank Lexington, damaged Yorktown)
- Strategic US victory (Port Moresby invasion canceled)
- Changed naval warfare forever - surface ships secondary

**Zuiho's Longevity:**
**Survived 4 major carrier battles:**
1. Eastern Solomons (August 1942) - minor damage
2. Santa Cruz (October 1942) - moderate damage
3. Philippine Sea (June 1944) - survived undamaged
4. Leyte Gulf (October 1944) - sunk

**Why Zuiho Survived So Long:**
1. **Luck:** Avoided fatal hits until Leyte
2. **Size:** Small target, harder to hit
3. **Speed:** 28 knots adequate for evasion
4. **Good damage control:** Crew experienced
5. **Position:** Often in supporting role, not primary target

**Legacy:** Shoho-class demonstrated value of quick carrier conversions. Converted from submarine tenders (1938-1940), provided needed carriers. Shoho's loss at Coral Sea (May 1942) historic - first Japanese carrier sunk, first ever carrier vs carrier kill. Lt. Dixon's "Scratch one flattop!" became legendary. Zuiho survived nearly 4 years of intense combat (4 major carrier battles) until Leyte Gulf. Showed converted carriers could perform adequately despite limitations. Both contributed significantly to Japanese carrier operations. Names: Shoho (Auspicious Phoenix), Zuiho (Lucky Phoenix) - neither lucky ultimately, both lost.

**Historical Significance:** Shoho-class provided critical carriers when Japan needed them. Shoho's loss at Coral Sea symbolically important - first Japanese carrier sunk, first carrier vs carrier kill, proved carrier aircraft supremacy. US morale boost at critical time (after Pearl Harbor, Philippines fall). Zuiho's 4-year survival remarkable - participated in Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz, Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf. Both conversions successful operationally despite design limitations. Zuiho's decoy role at Leyte Gulf successful (lured Halsey north) but cost her life. Together showed Japan's resourcefulness in converting available hulls. Both died fighting - Shoho overwhelmed at Coral Sea, Zuiho sacrificed as decoy at Leyte Gulf. Small carriers, big impact.
