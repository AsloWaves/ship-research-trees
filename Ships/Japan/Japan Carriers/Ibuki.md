**The Incomplete Conversion** - Ibuki was a heavy cruiser being converted to aircraft carrier. Originally fourth Mogami-class cruiser, converted during construction 1943. Conversion ~80% complete by war's end but never finished. 27 aircraft planned, 29 knots. Work abandoned 1945, scrapped incomplete 1946-1947. Most advanced Japanese carrier conversion never completed. Showed desperation - converting cruisers mid-construction - but too late, too slow.

**Key Specs (planned):** 17,200/20,000 tons | 656ft | 29 kn | 27 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 40-60× 25mm AA | 60-100mm belt | Never completed

**Innovation:** Heavy cruiser converted to carrier during construction. Originally laid down as fourth Mogami-class cruiser "Ibuki" (1942). After Midway losses, conversion to carrier ordered (1943). Hull structure modified, flight deck added, hangar installed. Retained cruiser armor (2.4-3.9 inch belt). 27 aircraft planned. Work progressed to ~80% complete by 1945. Abandoned when war ended - fuel shortage, labor shortage, priorities shifted. Never commissioned. Scrapped on slipway 1946-1947. Most complete unfinished carrier conversion.

**Design (planned):** Converted from heavy cruiser hull. Full-length flight deck (656 ft) over modified hull. Single hangar deck. Island starboard (small). Two elevators. Four-shaft cruiser machinery (29 knots). **Retained cruiser armor** - unusual for carrier (2.4-3.9 inch belt, 2 inch deck). Eight 5-inch DP guns (four twin turrets). Heavy light AA (40-60× 25mm planned). 27 aircraft capacity - light carrier size. Faster than escort carriers, more protected than converted liners.

**Ship (never completed):**
- **Ibuki** - Construction begun June 1942 as cruiser, conversion ordered 1943, abandoned ~80% complete 1945, scrapped 1946-1947

**Construction Timeline:**

**As Heavy Cruiser (1942-1943):**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** April 24, 1942 (as fourth Mogami-class heavy cruiser)
- **Launched:** May 21, 1943 (as cruiser hull)
- **Original plan:** Complete as 10,000-ton treaty cruiser with 5× twin 155mm turrets

**Conversion to Carrier (1943-1945):**
- **Conversion ordered:** December 1943 (after Midway disaster)
- **Work begun:** Early 1944
- **Progress by mid-1944:** ~40% complete as carrier
- **Progress by early 1945:** ~60% complete
- **Progress by August 1945:** ~80% complete
- **Work stopped:** August 15, 1945 (surrender)
- **Final status:** Never commissioned
- **Scrapped:** 1946-1947 (broken up at Kure)

**Why Conversion Ordered:**

**Post-Midway Crisis (June 1942):**
- 4 fleet carriers lost (Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu)
- Carrier shortage acute
- New construction too slow (3-4 years)
- Conversions faster

**Ibuki Situation:**
- Heavy cruiser under construction
- Hull ~30% complete by late 1943
- Could be converted before completion
- Faster than building carrier from scratch
- Similar to US Independence-class conversions

**Decision:** Convert to carrier (December 1943)

**Conversion Work Completed:**

**Hull Modifications:**
- Superstructure removed
- Hull widened (added blisters)
- Hangar deck installed
- Flight deck framing erected

**Machinery:**
- Cruiser turbines installed
- Four shafts
- 152,000 shp
- 29 knots capability

**Armament:**
- Four twin 5-inch DP turrets installed
- AA gun positions prepared
- ~50% of light AA installed

**Aviation Facilities:**
- Hangar partially fitted out
- Elevator wells cut
- Catapult foundations laid
- Aviation fuel tanks installed

**Not Completed:**
- Flight deck not finished
- Elevators not installed
- Island not completed
- Fire control not installed
- Aircraft handling equipment missing
- ~20% work remaining

**Why Never Completed:**

**Resource Shortages (1944-1945):**
1. **Steel shortage:** Priority to submarines, escorts
2. **Labor shortage:** Workers drafted or sent to repair damaged ships
3. **Fuel shortage:** No fuel for completed carriers anyway
4. **Material shortage:** Electrical, mechanical equipment scarce
5. **Bombing:** US air raids disrupted work

**Shifting Priorities (1945):**
- Carriers needed pilots and aircraft (both scarce)
- Submarines and escorts higher priority
- War situation desperate - carriers wouldn't matter
- Work slowed, then stopped

**Surrender (August 1945):**
- Work abandoned
- Ship ~80% complete
- Never commissioned
- Fate: Scrapping

**Comparison - Cruiser Conversions:**

**Japan:**
| Ship | Original | Conversion Ordered | Completed | Fate |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------|------|
| **Ibuki** | **Mogami-class cruiser** | **Dec 1943** | **Never** | **Scrapped incomplete** |
| Mogami | Heavy cruiser | 1943 (minor) | 1943 | Aviation cruiser, sunk Surigao Strait |

**USA (successful conversions):**
| Class | Original | Conversion | Completed | Ships |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Independence | Cleveland-class cruiser | 1942 | 1943 | 9 of 9 completed |

**Key Difference:** US converted early (1942), completed fast (1943). Japan converted late (1943), never completed.

**Independence-Class Comparison:**
- **US Independence-class:** 9 cruisers converted 1942-1943, all completed, all fought
- **Japanese Ibuki:** 1 cruiser converted 1943-1945, never completed
- **Difference:** Timing and resources

**If Ibuki Completed:**

**Estimated Capabilities:**
- 27 aircraft (light carrier)
- 29 knots (fast for carrier)
- Armored (cruiser belt retained)
- Good range (6,000 nm)

**Impact:**
- One more carrier (marginal impact)
- By 1945, pilots and aircraft scarce
- Fuel shortage would limit ops
- Unlikely to change war outcome

**Estimated Completion:**
- **If work continued:** Late 1945 or early 1946
- **Reality:** War ended first

**Post-War Scrapping (1946-1947):**
- Captured incomplete by Allies
- Assessed for condition
- Deemed not worth completing
- Broken up at Kure
- Steel salvaged
- Most visible incomplete carrier in Japan

**Legacy:** Ibuki represented Japan's desperate carrier shortage response - convert heavy cruiser mid-construction. Ordered December 1943 after Midway losses. Work progressed to ~80% complete by war's end (August 1945) but never finished. Resource shortages, labor shortages, bombing, shifting priorities prevented completion. Most advanced incomplete carrier conversion. Scrapped 1946-1947. Showed that mid-war conversions required resources and time Japan didn't have. US Independence-class (9 conversions, all completed 1943) succeeded because converted earlier with more resources. Ibuki: Good idea, too late, too slow. Name: Ibuki River.

**Historical Significance:** Ibuki epitomized "too little, too late." Heavy cruiser construction begun April 1942. Conversion to carrier ordered December 1943 (18 months into construction). Work progressed slowly due to resource shortages. By August 1945 (surrender), ~80% complete but never finished. Showed Japan couldn't match US industrial capacity - US converted 9 Independence-class cruisers to carriers 1942-1943 (all completed, all fought). Japan attempted 1 conversion 1943-1945 (never completed). Even if finished, wouldn't matter - fuel, pilots, aircraft all scarce by 1945. Incomplete hull scrapped 1946-1947. Visible symbol of Japan's industrial limitations. Good concept (cruiser conversion), but timing, resources, execution all failed.
