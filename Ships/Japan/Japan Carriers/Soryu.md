**First Purpose-Built Carrier** - Soryu was first purpose-built (not converted) IJN fleet carrier. Commissioned 1937. 746 ft, 57-71 aircraft. High speed (34.5 knots). Pearl Harbor veteran. Template for subsequent IJN carrier designs. Sunk at Battle of Midway June 4, 1942 - destroyed in 3 minutes by dive bombers.

**Key Specs:** 15,900/19,800 tons | 746ft | 34.5 kn | 57-71 aircraft | 12× 127mm DP + 28× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** First purpose-built Japanese fleet carrier (Akagi, Kaga were conversions). Set template for IJN carrier design - island starboard, two hangars, high speed. Smaller than conversions but faster and more efficient. Unarmored for speed and aircraft capacity. Demonstrated Japan could build effective carriers from scratch. Design influenced Hiryu (modified sister) and Shokaku-class.

**Design:** Full-length flight deck (746 ft). Island on starboard side. Two hangar decks. Large elevators. Three arresting wires. No armor protection - emphasis on speed and air group size. Twelve 5-inch DP guns. Good speed (34.5 knots) for fast carrier task forces. Efficient design maximized aircraft complement for displacement.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Kure Naval Arsenal
- Laid down: November 20, 1934
- Launched: December 23, 1935
- Commissioned: December 29, 1937
- Cost: 45 million yen

**Service:**
- **1937-1941:** Training, China operations (1937-1938), fleet exercises
- **December 7, 1941:** **Pearl Harbor attack** - Kido Butai second division
- **January-February 1942:** East Indies operations, Darwin raid
- **April 1942:** Indian Ocean raid - attacked Colombo
- **May 1942:** Missed Battle of Coral Sea (with Hiryu, escorting troop convoy to Midway)
- **June 4, 1942:** **Battle of Midway** - sunk

**Battle of Midway (June 4, 1942):**
*Fastest carrier loss at Midway*

- Part of four-carrier strike force (Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, Soryu)
- Launched attack on Midway Island (morning)
- **10:25 AM:** Hit by 3 bombs from SBD Dauntless dive bombers (USS Yorktown VB-3)
- All three bombs hit in ~3 minutes
- One bomb penetrated hangar deck, exploded among armed aircraft
- Massive fires erupted immediately
- Aviation fuel and ordnance explosions
- Abandoned at 10:45 AM (only 20 minutes after first hit)
- Wracked by explosions throughout afternoon
- Sank at 7:13 PM June 4, 1942
- 711 killed (including air group), 392 survivors

**Aircraft Complement (December 1941):**
- 21× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 21× D3A1 Val dive bombers
- 21× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- 6× spare aircraft
- **Total:** 63 operational + 8 reserve = 71 aircraft

**Pearl Harbor Attack (Soryu contribution):**
- **First Wave:** 18 aircraft
  - 8× A6M Zero fighters
  - 8× D3A Val dive bombers
  - 2× B5N Kate level bombers
- Attacked Ford Island, battleship row
- All aircraft returned

**Notable Actions:**
- **Pearl Harbor:** Contributed 18 aircraft first wave
- **Darwin Raid (February 19, 1942):** Combined with Kaga and Akagi to devastate Darwin, Australia
- **Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942):** Attacked Colombo (Ceylon) with fleet carriers
- **Midway:** Destroyed fastest of four carriers - only 20 minutes from first hit to abandonment

**Loss Analysis:**
- **Fastest carrier loss at Midway** - only 20 minutes combat to abandonment
- Three bomb hits in rapid succession (3 minutes)
- Unarmored design meant bombs penetrated easily to hangars
- Aircraft being rearmed for second strike - maximum vulnerability
- Aviation fuel fires uncontrollable
- Design emphasized speed over protection - fatal weakness
- Inadequate damage control systems
- Small size meant less redundancy than larger carriers

**Comparison to Other Midway Losses:**
- **Soryu:** 3 bombs, abandoned 10:45 AM (20 minutes)
- **Kaga:** 4-5 bombs, abandoned 4:50 PM (6.5 hours)
- **Akagi:** 3 bombs, abandoned 4:55 PM (6.5 hours)
- **Hiryu:** Multiple attacks, scuttled next day (survived longest)

**Wreck Discovery:**
- Located October 2019 by R/V Petrel
- Depth: 5,400 meters (17,716 feet)
- Located northwest of Midway
- Wreck upright, bow section damaged
- Clear evidence of fire and explosion damage

**Legacy:** Soryu proved Japan could design and build effective fleet carriers from scratch (not just conversions). Fast, efficient design that maximized air group for displacement. Pearl Harbor showed striking power of purpose-built carriers. Midway showed vulnerability - unarmored design meant rapid destruction from dive bomber attack. Fastest loss at Midway (only 20 minutes) demonstrated fatal flaw of emphasizing speed/aircraft over protection. Name means "Blue Dragon" (Azure Dragon) - one of four legendary Chinese constellation spirits.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Maximize speed (34.5 knots)
- Maximize aircraft complement
- Minimize armor (zero belt armor)
- Emphasis on offensive power over defensive protection
- Similar to US Lexington/Yorktown philosophy
- Opposite of British armored carrier approach
- Fatal in combat - unarmored hangars vulnerable to bombs

**Historical Significance:** Soryu demonstrated effectiveness and vulnerability of unarmored carriers. Pearl Harbor attack validated design - speed and large air group devastated battleships. Midway showed weakness - unarmored hangars became death traps when hit. Rapid loss (20 minutes) shocked Japanese - realization that carriers, despite offensive power, were extremely fragile. Influenced later Japanese designs (Taiho - armored carrier). US Navy learned lesson - better damage control, fireproof hangars (post-war). Soryu's fate embodied IJN carrier doctrine - offensive striking power prioritized over survivability.
