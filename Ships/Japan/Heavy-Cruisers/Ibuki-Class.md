**Never Completed** - Ibuki-class were Japan's final heavy cruiser design. 4 ships planned as improved Mogami-class. Ten 8-inch guns, 35 knots, 12,200 tons. Construction begun 1942-1943 but war priorities intervened. Ibuki converted to light carrier (incomplete at surrender). Other three (Ikoma, Kurama, planned 4th) cancelled 1943-1944 (steel shortages). None completed. Showed Japan's late-war inability to finish major warships - resources/shipyards overwhelmed by losses. Design improvements over Mogami but never tested.

**Key Specs (planned):** 12,200/14,650 tons | 656ft | 35 kn | 10× 203mm + 8× 100mm DP | 102mm belt | 0 completed

**Innovation:** Final Japanese heavy cruiser evolution. Improved Mogami-class design incorporating war lessons. Ten 8-inch guns (five twin turrets). Eight 100mm DP secondary guns (better AA than earlier cruisers). Four-shaft turbines (35 knots - very fast). Better armor distribution than Mogami. Larger displacement (12,200 vs 11,200 tons). But construction overtaken by events - carrier/destroyer priority, steel shortages, bombing of shipyards. Ibuki converted to carrier while incomplete (30% complete). Other three cancelled. None completed as cruisers. Represented what Japan wanted to build vs what Japan could afford late war.

**Design (planned):** Five twin 8-inch turrets (three forward, two aft). Eight 100mm DP guns (twin mounts). Twelve 25mm AA guns initially (planned heavy increase). Eight Long Lance torpedoes (two quad launchers). Two floatplanes, one catapult. Four-shaft turbines (35 knots - fast for heavy cruiser). Moderate armor (4-inch belt, 2.5-inch deck). Large for treaty cruiser. Incorporated Mogami lessons - better stability, stronger structure, improved fire control. Advanced design but never proven in combat.

**Ships (4 planned - 0 completed):**

**Converted to carrier (incomplete):**
1. **Ibuki** - Construction begun 1942, converted to carrier 1943, incomplete at surrender 1945

**Cancelled early:**
2. **Ikoma** - Cancelled 1943, scrapped on slipway
3. **Kurama** - Cancelled 1943, scrapped on slipway
4. **[Unnamed 4th ship]** - Cancelled before laying down

**Construction:**

**Ibuki:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** April 24, 1942 (as heavy cruiser)
- **Construction halted:** 1943 (~30% complete)
- **Conversion ordered:** 1943 (to light carrier)
- **Conversion progress:** ~80% complete as carrier by August 1945
- **Fate:** Incomplete at surrender, scrapped 1946-1947

**Ikoma and Kurama:**
- **Laid down:** 1942-1943 (sources vary)
- **Cancelled:** 1943
- **Reason:** Steel shortages, shifting priorities
- **Fate:** Scrapped on slipways before launch

**Why None Completed:**

**Resource Shortages:**
1. **Steel:** Critically short by 1943 (merchant shipping losses, bombing)
2. **Labor:** Shipyard workers drafted or killed in air raids
3. **Time:** Building heavy cruiser: 3-4 years (too long)
4. **Priorities:** Carriers, destroyers, submarines more urgent

**Strategic Shift:**
1. **Carrier losses:** Midway, Philippine Sea - carrier priority
2. **Submarine threat:** US subs sinking merchant fleet - escort destroyers needed
3. **Heavy cruisers:** Less useful than carriers/destroyers
4. **Defensive war:** 1943 onwards - heavy cruisers offensive weapons

**Bombing:**
1. **Shipyards attacked:** B-29 raids on Kure, Yokosuka
2. **Construction disrupted:** Constant delays
3. **Damage:** Ibuki damaged during conversion
4. **Resources diverted:** Repair existing ships vs build new

**Ibuki Carrier Conversion:**

**Decision (1943):**
- Ibuki ~30% complete as heavy cruiser
- Japan desperately needed carriers (Midway losses)
- Conversion ordered: Heavy cruiser → light carrier
- **Rationale:** Faster than new carrier construction

**Conversion Work:**
- Remove heavy cruiser superstructure
- Add flight deck
- Install hangar
- Aircraft capacity: 27 aircraft planned
- **Progress:** 80% complete by August 1945
- **Problems:** Constant air raids, material shortages

**August 1945: Surrender:**
- Ibuki at Kure, incomplete
- Never launched as carrier
- Never conducted trials
- **Fate:** Scrapped 1946-1947 (never operational)

**Comparison to Completed Ships:**

**vs Mogami-class:**
| Feature | Mogami | Ibuki (planned) |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Displacement** | 11,200 tons | 12,200 tons |
| **Main guns** | 10× 8\" | 10× 8\" |
| **Secondary** | 8× 127mm | 8× 100mm DP |
| **Speed** | 35 kn | 35 kn |
| **Armor** | 4\" belt | 4\" belt |
| **Built** | 4 completed | 0 completed |

**Ibuki: Improvements planned but never realized**

**What Ibuki-Class Would Have Been:**

**Strengths (theoretical):**
1. **Firepower:** Ten 8-inch guns (powerful broadside)
2. **Speed:** 35 knots (very fast)
3. **AA:** Better than earlier cruisers (100mm DP guns)
4. **Range:** Good for Pacific operations
5. **Torpedoes:** Eight Long Lance (deadly in night action)

**Weaknesses (predicted):**
1. **Armor:** Light for size (vulnerable to battleships)
2. **AA:** Still inadequate vs 1944-1945 air attacks
3. **Timing:** Completed 1945-1946 (too late)
4. **Vulnerability:** Like all cruisers to submarines/aircraft

**Likely Fate if Completed:**
- Entering service 1945-1946 (war ending)
- Facing overwhelming US air/submarine power
- Probable loss like other late-war cruisers
- Or surrender incomplete/damaged

**Ikoma and Kurama:**

**Minimal Construction:**
- Laid down on slipways
- Keel plates laid
- Some frame assembly
- **Cancelled early:** <10% complete
- Steel reclaimed for other projects

**Why Cancelled:**
1. **Clear by 1943:** Japan losing war
2. **Couldn't complete:** 2-3 years needed
3. **Steel critical:** Every ton needed elsewhere
4. **Carriers prioritized:** Carrier losses enormous
5. **Destroyers needed:** Escort shortage acute

**Legacy:** Ibuki-class represented Japan's final heavy cruiser ambitions. Four ships planned as improved Mogami-class. Better AA, refined design, 35 knots. But none completed - war intervened. Ibuki converted to carrier while incomplete (never finished). Ikoma and Kurama cancelled on slipways (steel shortages). Showed Japan's late-war crisis - couldn't complete major warships started 1942-1943. Resources, labor, shipyards overwhelmed. Heavy cruisers low priority vs carriers/destroyers. Ibuki scrapped 1947 incomplete - never sailed. Names: Mountains (Ibuki, Ikoma, Kurama).

**Historical Significance:** Ibuki-class epitomized Japanese late-war futility. Four heavy cruisers planned 1942 - none completed. Ibuki laid down April 1942 (after Midway), converted to carrier 1943 (after Philippine Sea), incomplete at surrender 1945 - 40 months construction, zero operational service. Ikoma and Kurama cancelled 1943 on slipways. Showed Japanese miscalculation - planning four heavy cruisers when couldn't complete one. Steel shortages, bombing, shifting priorities doomed class. Compare to USA: Built dozens of cruisers 1942-1945. Japan: Built zero. Strategic bankruptcy. Ibuki conversion showed desperation - half-built cruiser to half-built carrier - neither useful. Represented might-have-been - good design, never tested. All four ships scrapped on slipways or incomplete - total waste of resources that could have built destroyers/escorts. Japan's industrial collapse visible in Ibuki-class failure.
