**First Heavy Cruisers** - Furutaka-class were Japan's first 8-inch gun heavy cruisers and first treaty cruisers. 2 ships built 1926. Originally six single 8-inch guns, modernized 1937-1939 to three twin turrets. Both lost at Guadalcanal 1942. Kako first major IJN warship sunk in WWII (August 10, 1942).

**Key Specs:** 9,150/11,660 tons | 607ft | 35 kn | 6× 203mm (3 twin turrets after modernization) + 8× 610mm Type 93 torpedoes | 76mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese heavy cruisers with 8-inch guns. First Japanese treaty cruisers under Washington Naval Treaty 10,000-ton limit. Originally unique six single 8-inch mounts (only cruisers ever with this configuration). Modernized 1937-1939 to three twin turrets like Aoba-class. High speed (35 knots). Light armor for speed and armament. Kako holds dubious distinction - first major IJN warship sunk in WWII.

**Design (As Built 1926):** Six single 8-inch guns (three forward, three aft) - unique arrangement never repeated. Four triple 24-inch torpedo tubes. High speed (34.5 knots). Light armor (3-inch belt). Typical 1920s treaty cruiser compromise - maximum armament on limited displacement.

**Design (After 1937-1939 Modernization):** Three twin 8-inch turrets (two forward superfiring, one aft). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers (Type 93 Long Lance). Enhanced AA armament. Two floatplanes with catapults. Wider beam for stability. Same appearance as Aoba-class after refit.

**Ships:**
- **Furutaka** - Sunk October 11-12, 1942 (Battle of Cape Esperance), 258 killed
- **Kako** - Sunk August 10, 1942 (submarine USS S-44), 71 killed

**Construction:**
- **Furutaka:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down December 5, 1922, launched February 25, 1925, commissioned March 31, 1926
- **Kako:** Kawasaki Kobe, laid down November 17, 1922, launched April 10, 1925, commissioned July 20, 1926

**Modernization (1937-1939):**
- **Single to twin turrets:** Six single 8-inch mounts removed, three twin turrets installed
- **Torpedo upgrade:** Triple launchers replaced with quad Type 93 launchers
- **AA enhancement:** 25mm guns added
- **Aircraft facilities:** Second catapult, improved hangar
- **Armor:** Slightly increased
- **Beam widened:** 2.9 feet for stability
- Cost: Almost as much as new cruiser

**Service:**
- **Furutaka (1926-1942):**
  - 1930s: China operations, fleet exercises
  - 1937-1939: Modernization refit
  - 1941-1942: Philippines, Dutch East Indies invasions
  - **August 9, 1942:** Battle of Savo Island
  - **October 11-12, 1942:** Battle of Cape Esperance - sunk

- **Kako (1926-1942):**
  - 1930s: China operations
  - 1937-1938: Modernization refit
  - 1941-1942: Philippines, Dutch East Indies invasions
  - **August 9, 1942:** Battle of Savo Island
  - **August 10, 1942:** Sunk by submarine - first major IJN loss

**Battle of Savo Island (August 8-9, 1942):**
*Greatest US naval defeat*

**Background:**
- US invaded Guadalcanal August 7, 1942
- Japanese counterattack: 7 cruisers, 1 destroyer
- Furutaka and Kako part of force

**August 9, 1942 (~1:30 AM):**
- Japanese surprise night attack
- Perfect execution of night-fighting doctrine
- Furutaka and Kako engaged Allied screening force
- 4 Allied cruisers sunk (3 US, 1 Australian)
- Japanese victory with minimal damage
- Both Furutaka and Kako undamaged

**Sinking of Kako (August 10, 1942):**
*First major IJN warship lost in WWII*

**Background:**
- Returning from Savo Island victory
- Transiting St. George's Channel near Rabaul
- USS S-44 (submarine) on patrol

**August 10, 1942 (8:08 AM):**
- USS S-44 fired 4 torpedoes at 700 yards
- **Three torpedoes hit Kako**
- Starboard side hits near magazines
- Massive explosions, fires
- **8:12 AM:** Capsized and sank (only 4 minutes!)
- **71 killed, 568 survivors**
- First major IJN warship sunk in WWII
- Shocking loss - day after major victory

**Battle of Cape Esperance (October 11-12, 1942):**
*US revenge for Savo Island*

**Background:**
- Japanese reinforcement force to Guadalcanal
- Furutaka, Aoba, Kinugasa + destroyers
- US force: 4 light cruisers, 5 destroyers (radar-equipped)

**October 11-12, 1942:**
- **11:46 PM:** US force crossed Japanese T (radar advantage)
- Surprise gunfire at close range
- Furutaka hit by numerous shells
- Fires erupted, torpedo explosions
- Dead in water
- **Abandoned at 2:30 AM**
- **Sank at dawn, October 12**
- **258 killed, 381 survivors**
- Aoba heavily damaged (Admiral Goto killed)
- Kinugasa damaged but survived

**Why Both Lost Quickly:**
1. **Light armor:** 3-inch belt insufficient against 6-inch/8-inch shells
2. **Kako:** Caught by surprise, no evasive action
3. **Furutaka:** Ambushed by radar-equipped force
4. **Both:** Old design (1926) facing modern warfare
5. **Cape Esperance:** Radar negated Japanese night-fighting advantage

**Treaty Context:**
**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Cruisers limited to 10,000 tons
- Maximum guns: 8-inch
- Furutaka-class designed to maximize armament on treaty displacement
- Actually exceeded treaty limit (9,150/11,660 tons)
- But nominally compliant

**Single Gun Mounts (Original 1926):**
**Why Used:**
- Lighter than twin turrets
- Faster to develop
- Allowed six guns on limited displacement
- Could fire independently

**Why Abandoned:**
- Inefficient use of space
- Vulnerable to damage (one hit = one gun lost)
- Twin turrets became standard
- 1937-1939: Converted to three twins

**203mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same guns as all IJN heavy cruisers
- **Shell weight:** 125.85 kg (277 lbs)
- **Maximum range:** 29,400 meters (32,150 yards)
- **Rate of fire:** 3-5 rounds per minute

**Comparison - First Treaty Cruisers:**
| Class | Nation | Commissioned | Guns (Original) | Modernized |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Furutaka** | **Japan** | **1926** | **6× 8" single** | **3× 8" twin** |
| Pensacola | USA | 1930 | 10× 8" twin | No change |
| Kent | UK | 1928 | 8× 8" twin | Minor |

**USS S-44 Achievement:**
- Old S-class submarine (1923)
- Sank Kako with perfect attack
- First major IJN warship kill
- Proved submarine threat
- S-44 itself sunk October 1943 by Japanese destroyer

**Legacy:** Furutaka-class pioneered Japanese heavy cruiser development. First 8-inch gun cruisers. First treaty cruisers. Unique six single-gun arrangement never repeated. Both modernized with twin turrets 1937-1939. Kako holds grim distinction - first major IJN warship sunk in WWII (day after Savo Island victory). Furutaka lost at Cape Esperance - US revenge for Savo. Both showed vulnerability of lightly-armored 1920s designs to modern warfare. Kako's rapid sinking (4 minutes) showed submarine threat. Names: Mountains in Japan - Furutaka, Kako.

**Historical Significance:** Furutaka-class marked Japan's entry into treaty cruiser competition. First 8-inch gun ships showed Japan could match Western designs. Unique single-gun layout experimental - abandoned for twins. Both ships central to early Guadalcanal naval battles. Kako's loss (first major warship) shocked IJN - submarines were deadly threat. Furutaka's loss at Cape Esperance showed radar changed night fighting. Together represented transition from peacetime experimentation to wartime reality. Design lessons learned - influenced Aoba, Myoko, and subsequent classes. Both died proving that 1926 light armor couldn't survive 1942 combat.
