**First Heavy Cruisers** - Kako-class (Furutaka subclass) were Japan's first heavy cruisers with 8-inch guns. 2 ships commissioned 1926. Originally six single 8-inch guns (unusual), modernized 1936-1937 to three twin turrets + 12 torpedoes. Both saw extensive combat. Both lost 1942 (100% loss rate). Kako first major IJN warship sunk WWII (August 10, 1942, submarine USS S-44). Furutaka sunk October 1942 (Battle of Cape Esperance). Represented Japanese transition to treaty cruisers.

**Key Specs:** 9,150/11,660 tons | 607ft | 33.5 kn | 6× 203mm (3 twin) + 12× 610mm torpedoes | 76mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese heavy cruisers with 8-inch guns (treaty classification). Originally unique design: six single 8-inch gun mounts (three per side, all centerline). First to carry large torpedoes (originally six singles, later twelve in triple launchers). Modernized 1936-1937: Replaced six singles with three twin turrets, added Long Lance torpedoes. Both fought throughout early WWII. Kako first major Japanese warship sunk WWII (submarine USS S-44, August 1942). Furutaka lost at Cape Esperance (October 1942). Both gone within 2 months. 100% loss rate.

**Design (after modernization):** Three twin 8-inch turrets (two forward, one aft - after 1936-1937 refit). Four 4.7-inch secondary guns. Eight 25mm AA guns. Twelve 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes (four triple launchers). Two floatplanes, one catapult. Four-shaft turbines (33.5 knots). Light armor (3-inch belt) for speed. Tall pagoda superstructure (after modernization). Originally built with six single 8-inch guns (1926), modernized to twin turrets (1936-1937) for efficiency.

**Ships (2 built - both lost):**
1. **Kako** - Sunk August 10, 1942 (submarine USS S-44, off Kavieng), 71 killed
2. **Furutaka** - Sunk October 11, 1942 (surface action, Battle of Cape Esperance), 258 killed

**Construction:**
- **Kako:** Kawasaki Kobe, commissioned July 20, 1926

**Battle of Savo Island (August 8-9, 1942):**
*Kako's Last Victory*

**Background:**
- Japanese surprise night attack
- Target: US cruisers off Guadalcanal
- Kako part of attacking force

**August 8-9, 1942 (Night):**
- Japanese surprise achieved
- **Torpedoes and gunfire devastated US cruisers**

**August 10, 1942 - Sinking of Kako:**
*First major IJN warship sunk WWII*

**Background:**
- Kako withdrawing from Savo Island victory
- USS S-44 (submarine) on patrol off Kavieng
- Kako approaching Kavieng

**August 10, 1942 (5:10 AM):**
**Attack:**
- **USS S-44 detected Kako** (periscope)
- Perfect position
- Fired spread of 4 torpedoes
- **Four torpedoes hit Kako**
- Massive explosions amidships

**Fatal Damage:**
- Engine rooms flooded
- Fires throughout ship
- Dead in water
- Flooding uncontrollable

**Sinking:**
- **Capsized within 5 minutes**
- **Sank rapidly**
- **71 killed, 700+ survivors** (quick rescue by escorts)
- **First major IJN warship sunk in WWII**
- Just 48 hours after Savo Island victory

**Significance:**
- Sweet turned bitter instantly
- Victory celebration became mourning
- USS S-44 avenged Savo Island partially
- Showed Japanese not invincible

**Battle of Cape Esperance (October 11-12, 1942):**
*Furutaka's Last Battle*

**Background:**
- Japanese "Tokyo Express" supply run
- US cruiser/destroyer force intercepted
- Night action off Guadalcanal

**October 11, 1942 (Night):**
**Engagement:**
- US cruisers detected Japanese force
- **Crossed the T** (perfect position)
- Heavy gunfire from USS Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Boise
- Furutaka hit multiple times

**Furutaka's Ordeal:**
- Hit by 8-inch shells from US cruisers
- Fires throughout ship
- Steering damaged

- Dead in water

**October 12, 1942 (Dawn):**
- **Furutaka capsized and sank**
- **258 killed, 400+ survivors**
- One of three Japanese ships sunk (Furutaka, destroyer Fubuki, destroyer Murakumo damaged/scuttled)

**Significance:**
- US tactical victory (rare night victory)
- Japanese supply mission disrupted
- Furutaka second Kako-class lost (2 months after Kako)

**Loss Statistics:**
- **2 built, 2 lost (100% loss rate)**
- **Causes:**
  - Submarine: 1 ship (Kako)
  - Surface action: 1 ship (Furutaka)
- **Loss period:** August-October 1942 (2 months)
- **Total casualties:** 329 killed

**203mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Nachi, Takao, Myoko classes
- **Caliber:** 203mm (8 inches)
- **Shell weight:** 110 kg (243 lbs)
- **Maximum range:** 29,400 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 3-4 rounds per minute

**Original vs Modernized Design:**

**Original (1926):**
- **Six single 8-inch gun mounts**
- Centerline arrangement
- Three forward, three aft
- Slow rate of fire (single mounts)
- Heavy topweight

**Modernized (1936-1937):**
- **Three twin 8-inch turrets**
- Two forward, one aft
- Better rate of fire (twin mounts)
- Reduced topweight
- Better stability
- Long Lance torpedoes added
- More AA armament

**Comparison - Early Heavy Cruisers:**
| Ship | Commissioned | Original Guns | Modernized Guns | Fate |
|------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------|
| **Kako** | **1926** | **6× single 8"** | **3× twin 8"** | **Submarine 1942** |
| **Furutaka** | **1926** | **6× single 8"** | **3× twin 8"** | **Surface action 1942** |
| Aoba | 1927 | 6× single 8" | 3× twin 8" | Survived damaged |
| Kinugasa | 1927 | 6× single 8" | 3× twin 8" | Air attack 1942 |

**100% loss rate for Kako-class (Furutaka subclass)**

**Why 100% Loss Rate (2 months):**
1. **Early war:** 1942, both sides learning
2. **Aggressive use:** Frontline combat constantly
3. **Guadalcanal:** Intense campaign, heavy attrition
4. **Light armor:** 3-inch belt insufficient
5. **Age:** 16 years old by 1942
6. **Bad luck:** Kako to submarine, Furutaka to gunfire

**USS S-44 (Kako's Killer):**
*Old submarine, big kill*

**Background:**
- S-class submarine (WWI-vintage design, built 1923)
- Slow, cramped, limited
- But: Skipper aggressive (Lt. Cmdr. Moore)

**Kako Kill (August 10, 1942):**
- Perfect position
- Four torpedo hits
- **First major Japanese warship sunk**
- Biggest kill for S-44

**Later Service:**
- Continued patrols
- **October 7, 1943:** Sunk by Japanese escort
- All hands lost (56 crew)
- But Kako kill already made reputation

**Legacy:** Kako-class (Furutaka subclass) represented Japan's first heavy cruisers. Commissioned 1926 with unique six single 8-inch guns. Modernized 1936-1937 to three twin turrets + Long Lance torpedoes. Both saw extensive early WWII combat. Kako sunk August 1942 by USS S-44 (first major IJN warship lost, just after Savo Island victory). Furutaka sunk October 1942 at Cape Esperance (surface action). Both lost within 2 months (100% loss rate). Showed transition from single to twin turrets improved efficiency. Names: Rivers (Kako River, Furutaka district).

**Historical Significance:** Kako-class marked Japan's entry into treaty heavy cruiser competition. First 8-inch gun cruisers (1926). Originally unique six-single-gun layout - inefficient but first attempt. Modernized 1936-1937 with twin turrets (lessons learned). Kako's sinking (August 10, 1942, USS S-44) historic - first major IJN warship lost WWII, just 48 hours after Savo Island victory. Showed war's brutal swings - victory to defeat in hours. Furutaka lost October 1942 at Cape Esperance (US night victory). Both gone within 2 months. 100% loss rate showed early war's intensity. Represented Japanese learning curve - single guns (inefficient) to twins (better) but both ships lost before design matured fully. First generation treaty cruisers - lessons applied to later classes (Nachi, Takao, Mogami).
