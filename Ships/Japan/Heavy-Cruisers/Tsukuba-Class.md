**Proto-Battlecruisers** - Tsukuba-class were Japanese armored cruisers with battleship guns. 2 ships commissioned 1907-1908. Four 12-inch guns (two twin turrets), 20.5 knots, 13,750 tons. Proto-battlecruisers - armored cruisers with capital ship armament before "battlecruiser" term existed. Coal-fired reciprocating engines. Tsukuba lost to magazine explosion 1917 (241 killed). Ikoma scrapped 1924 (Washington Treaty). Represented transition from armored cruiser to battlecruiser concept (later perfected in Kongo-class).

**Key Specs:** 13,750/15,400 tons | 449ft | 20.5 kn | 4× 305mm (12-inch) + 12× 152mm | 178mm belt | Coal-fired | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese armored cruisers with 12-inch guns (battleship caliber). Proto-battlecruisers - concept before term existed. Four 12-inch guns in two twin turrets (one forward, one aft). Twelve 6-inch secondary battery. Heavy armor (7-inch belt). But: Coal-fired reciprocating engines, only 20.5 knots (too slow for true battlecruiser). Commissioned 1907-1908 before HMS Invincible (1908, first official battlecruiser). Showed Japanese thinking toward battlecruiser concept. But obsolete when Kongo-class (27 knots, 14-inch guns, turbines) commissioned 1913. Tsukuba magazine explosion 1917 (241 killed). Ikoma scrapped 1924. Last coal-fired Japanese capital ships.

**Design:** Large armored cruiser hull (449 ft, 13,750 tons - larger than contemporary battleships). Two twin 12-inch turrets (centerline, fore and aft). Twelve single 6-inch guns (casemates). Twelve 3-inch tertiary guns. Three submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Heavy armor: 7-inch belt, 7-inch turrets, 2-inch deck. Coal-fired vertical triple expansion reciprocating engines. Two shafts. 20.5 knots (slow for "battlecruiser"). Crew 879. Pre-dreadnought construction - riveted, coal bunkers, reciprocating machinery. Transitional design between armored cruiser and battlecruiser.

**Ships (2 built):**

**Magazine explosion:**
1. **Tsukuba** - Lost to magazine explosion January 14, 1917, 241 killed

**Scrapped:**
2. **Ikoma** - Scrapped 1924 (Washington Naval Treaty)

**Construction:**

**Tsukuba:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** January 14, 1905
- **Launched:** December 26, 1905
- **Commissioned:** January 14, 1907

**Ikoma:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** March 15, 1905
- **Launched:** April 6, 1906
- **Commissioned:** March 24, 1908

**Service History:**

**Pre-WWI (1907-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training cruises
- China station patrols
- Already becoming obsolete (dreadnought revolution)

**WWI (1914-1918):**

**Tsukuba:**
- Limited operations (Pacific quiet)
- Training duties
- **January 14, 1917: Magazine explosion**

**Ikoma:**
- Pacific patrols
- Training
- Survived WWI

**Tsukuba Magazine Explosion (January 14, 1917):**
*Catastrophic Loss*

**Background:**
- Tsukuba at Yokosuka Naval Base
- At anchor
- Routine day
- No combat, no action

**January 14, 1917 (Afternoon):**
**2:00 PM:**
- **Massive explosion** in forward magazine
- No warning
- Ship ripped apart
- Forward section destroyed

**Cause (probable):**
- Ammunition instability (age, storage conditions)
- Spontaneous combustion (cordite deterioration)
- Poor ventilation in magazine
- No enemy action

**Sinking:**
- Forward section blown off
- Massive flooding
- **Capsized rapidly**
- **Sank in minutes**
- **241 killed out of ~900 crew**
- ~660 survivors (many injured)

**Aftermath:**
- Investigation inconclusive
- Blamed on ammunition deterioration
- Led to improved magazine safety procedures
- Similar to HMS Vanguard explosion (1917, 843 killed)

**Ikoma Post-WWI (1918-1924):**

**1918-1922:**
- Reserve fleet
- Training ship
- Obsolete by any standard
- 20.5 knots too slow
- Coal-fired obsolete
- 12-inch guns adequate but ship too old

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Japan limited to 301,320 tons battleships/battlecruisers
- Ikoma classified as capital ship
- **Scrapped 1924** (freed tonnage for modern ships)
- No regrets - obsolete for years

**Proto-Battlecruiser Concept:**

**Tsukuba-Class (1907):**
- Armored cruiser (official designation)
- 12-inch guns (battleship armament)
- 20.5 knots (faster than battleships ~18 knots)
- 7-inch armor (lighter than battleships ~12 inches)
- **Concept:** Heavy guns, light armor, high speed

**HMS Invincible (1908):**
- First "battlecruiser" (official term)
- 8× 12-inch guns
- 25 knots (revolutionary)
- 6-inch belt (light)
- **Same concept, better execution**

**Tsukuba Problem:**
- Right idea (battlecruiser concept)
- Wrong technology (coal, reciprocating engines)
- Too slow (20.5 vs 25+ knots needed)
- Built 1905-1907 when technology changing rapidly

**Comparison - Early Battlecruisers:**
| Ship | Nation | Commissioned | Guns | Speed | Engines | Fate |
|------|--------|--------------|------|-------|---------|------|
| **Tsukuba** | **Japan** | **1907** | **4× 12"** | **20.5 kn** | **Recip/coal** | **Magazine explosion 1917** |
| **Ikoma** | **Japan** | **1908** | **4× 12"** | **20.5 kn** | **Recip/coal** | **Scrapped 1924** |
| Invincible | UK | 1908 | 8× 12" | 25 kn | Turbine/coal | Sunk Jutland 1916 |
| Kongo | Japan | 1913 | 8× 14" | 27 kn | Turbine/oil | Sunk 1944 (WWII) |

**Tsukuba: Proto-battlecruiser, too slow, obsolete quickly**

**Magazine Explosions - Historical Context:**

**Common Problem (1900s-1910s):**
- Cordite unstable (deteriorates over time)
- Poor magazine ventilation
- Inadequate safety procedures
- **Result:** Spontaneous explosions

**Examples:**
- **Tsukuba (1917):** 241 killed
- **HMS Vanguard (1917):** 843 killed (similar cause)
- **Jutland (1916):** 3 British battlecruisers exploded (magazine hits)

**Lesson:**
- Better magazine design
- Improved ammunition handling
- Flash protection
- Temperature control

**Why Slow (20.5 knots):**

**Technology Limitation:**
- Coal-fired reciprocating engines
- Pre-turbine technology
- Heavy machinery
- Less efficient

**Compare to Later:**
- **Kongo (1913):** Turbines, oil-fired, 27 knots
- **6.5 knots difference** = revolutionary gap
- Tsukuba couldn't catch anything
- Couldn't escape anything
- Speed inadequate for battlecruiser role

**Legacy:** Tsukuba-class represented Japanese proto-battlecruiser concept. Two ships (1907-1908) with 12-inch guns, 20.5 knots, 13,750 tons. Armored cruisers with battleship armament - battlecruiser concept before term existed. But coal-fired reciprocating engines too slow (20.5 knots inadequate). Tsukuba magazine explosion 1917 (241 killed) - ammunition safety failure. Ikoma scrapped 1924 (Washington Treaty, obsolete). Showed Japanese thinking toward battlecruisers but technology insufficient. Kongo-class (1913, 27 knots, turbines) properly executed concept. Last coal-fired Japanese capital ships. Names: Mountains (Tsukuba, Ikoma).

**Historical Significance:** Tsukuba-class showed right idea, wrong execution. First Japanese ships with 12-inch guns classified as cruisers - battlecruiser concept emerging. But 20.5 knots (reciprocating engines, coal) too slow for battlecruiser role (25+ knots needed). Commissioned 1907-1908 when technology evolving rapidly. HMS Invincible (1908, 25 knots, turbines) showed proper battlecruiser. Kongo (1913, 27 knots, oil-fired turbines, 14-inch guns) perfected it. Tsukuba-class obsolete within 5 years. Magazine explosion killed Tsukuba (1917, 241 dead) - showed ammunition safety crisis (similar to HMS Vanguard same year, 843 dead). Ikoma scrapped 1924 (Washington Treaty). Represented transitional moment - armored cruiser to battlecruiser evolution. Last coal-fired Japanese capital ships. Evolution: Tsukuba (1907, coal, 20.5 knots) → Kongo (1913, oil, 27 knots) = generational leap in 6 years.
