**Improved 5,500-Ton Type** - Nagara-class were improved Kuma-class light cruisers. 6 ships commissioned 1922-1925 (largest 5,500-ton class). Better bridge structure, improved fire control. Same specs: 5,832 tons, 36 knots, 7× 140mm guns, 8× 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes. Destroyer flotilla leaders. All 6 fought entire WWII. **All 6 lost in action** (100% casualty rate - complete annihilation of class!). Famous ships: Nagara (Midway carrier force), Sendai (namesake lost at Empress Augusta Bay). Early losses (Natori August 1944) to late (Isuzu April 1945). Nagara-class: Workhorses of IJN light cruiser force, total sacrifice.

**Key Specs:** 5,170/5,832 tons | 535ft | 36 kn | 7× 140mm + 8× 24-inch torpedoes | 6 ships | **ALL 6 LOST**

**Innovation:** Improved Kuma-class design (1922-1925). **Better bridge** - larger, improved visibility (lessons from Kuma). **Improved fire control** - Type 14 system refined. **Slightly thicker deck** - 1.25 inches vs 1 inch (marginal improvement). Same basic characteristics: 36-knot speed (90,000 shp, 4 shafts). 7× 140mm guns (single mounts). 8× 610mm torpedoes (Type 93 Long Lance fitted later). Light armor (2.5-inch belt). Seaplane catapult added 1930s (1-2 floatplanes). Minelaying capability (48 mines). Same role: Fast destroyer flotilla leaders, scouts, high-speed raids. 6 ships built (largest 5,500-ton class: more than Kuma's 5, more than Sendai's 3). Rapid construction 1922-1925 (4 years). All saw heavy WWII combat.

**Design:** Sleek light cruiser hull (535 ft, 5,832 tons). Seven 140mm Type 3 guns: single open mounts (3 forward, 2 midships, 2 aft). Excellent firing arcs but crews exposed. Eight 24-inch torpedo tubes: four twin mounts (centerline, wing mounts). Type 93 Long Lance (later refit): 40,000-yard range, oxygen-fueled, deadly. Two 80mm AA guns initially (increased to 4-6× 25mm by WWII). Improved bridge structure (larger than Kuma, better command facility). Four funnels (distinctive profile). Light armor: 2.5-inch belt, 1.25-inch deck (minimal protection). Twelve Kampon oil-fired boilers. Steam turbines (90,000 shp). Four shafts. 36 knots (could keep up with destroyers). Range 5,000 nm at 14 knots. Crew 450. Seaplane catapult amidships (added 1930s): 1-2 Type 95 or Type 0 floatplanes (reconnaissance, spotting). Minelaying rails (48 mines).

  - 1944: Converted to AA cruiser (6× twin 127mm AA, removed some main guns)
  - January-March 1945: Escort operations
  - **April 7, 1945**: Torpedoed by USS Gabilan and Charr (coordinated submarine attack)
  - Sunk in Sunda Strait
  - 190 killed
  - **Last Nagara-class lost** (nearly survived to war's end!)

**100% Loss Rate - Complete Annihilation:**

**Unprecedented:**
- 6 ships built
- **ALL 6 lost in action**
- 0 survivors (unique among major ship classes!)
- Contrast: Kuma had 1 survivor (Kitakami), Sendai all lost too

**Losses Breakdown:**
- **Submarines**: 4 ships (Nagara, Natori, Isuzu, Abukuma partially)
- **Aircraft**: 2 ships (Yura, Kinu)
- **Combined**: 1 ship (Abukuma: PT boats + aircraft)

**Timeline:**
- 1942: 1 lost (Yura)
- 1943: 0 lost
- 1944: 4 lost (Nagara, Natori, Kinu, Abukuma)
- 1945: 1 lost (Isuzu)

**Why Total Annihilation:**
1. **Entire war service**: All 6 fought 1941-1945 (maximum exposure)
2. **Light armor**: 2.5-inch belt useless vs torpedoes/bombs
3. **Outdated**: 1920s design, 20+ years old by WWII
4. **No early retirement**: Needed every cruiser (fleet shrinking)
5. **Submarine threat**: Pacific became US submarine shooting gallery 1943-1945
6. **Aircraft dominance**: US carriers/land-based aircraft overwhelmed by 1944
7. **Desperate battles**: Committed to Philippines (1944), Guadalcanal (1942-1943) - heavy combat

**Famous Actions:**

**Midway (June 1942) - Nagara:**
- **Battle**: June 4-7, 1942
- Nagara escorted carrier force (Kido Butai)
- June 4, 1942 morning: US dive bombers attacked
- Watched carriers Akagi, Kaga, Soryu destroyed in minutes
- Hiryu survived briefly, sunk later
- **All 4 Japanese carriers lost**
- Nagara and escorts withdrew
- Turning point of Pacific War (Japan lost initiative)
- Nagara survived battle, lived 2 more years (sunk August 1944)

**Guadalcanal Campaign - Multiple Ships:**
- **Yura**: Lost October 1942 (aircraft, scuttled)
- Others participated in "Tokyo Express" runs
- High-speed night supply missions
- Avoided US aircraft (night operations)
- Delivered troops/supplies, evacuated wounded
- Brutal attrition campaign

**Leyte Gulf (October 1944) - Kinu & Abukuma:**
- **Largest naval battle in history**
- October 23-26, 1944
- Multiple actions (Sibuyan Sea, Surigao Strait, Samar, Cape Engaño)
- **October 26**: Kinu sunk by carrier aircraft (Panay)
- **October 26**: Abukuma torpedoed by PT boats, finished by aircraft
- **2 Nagara-class lost in one battle!**

**Isuzu AA Conversion (1944):**

**Desperate Measure:**
- By 1944: Air threat overwhelming
- Light cruisers vulnerable, main guns (140mm) inadequate vs aircraft
- Decision: Convert Isuzu to dedicated AA cruiser

**Modifications:**
- **Removed**: 4× 140mm guns (kept 3 for surface defense)
- **Added**: 6× twin 127mm Type 89 AA guns (high-angle)
- **Added**: Many 25mm Type 96 AA guns (20-30 barrels)
- **Added**: AA fire control systems
- **Result**: Bristling with AA guns

**Intent:**
- Escort carriers/battleships (AA defense)
- Protect convoys from air attack
- Replace dedicated AA destroyers (not enough available)

**Effectiveness:**
- Unclear (limited operations before sinking)
- April 7, 1945: Torpedoed by submarines (AA guns useless vs underwater threat)
- Ironic: Converted to fight aircraft, killed by submarines

**Comparison - 5,500-Ton Classes:**

| Class | Ships | Commissioned | All Lost? | Last Loss | Loss Rate |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Kuma | 5 | 1920-1921 | No (1 survivor) | 1944 | 80% |
| **Nagara** | **6** | **1922-1925** | **YES** | **April 1945** | **100%** |
| Sendai | 3 | 1924-1925 | YES | 1943 | 100% |
| **TOTAL** | **14** | **1920-1925** | **No (1 survivor total)** | **April 1945** | **92.9%** |

**Nagara: Largest class, total annihilation**

**Comparison - 100% Loss Rate Classes:**

| Navy | Class | Type | Ships | Era | Notes |
|------|-------|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Japan** | **Nagara** | **Light Cruiser** | **6** | **Interwar/WWII** | **1922-1925, all lost 1942-1945** |
| Japan | Sendai | Light Cruiser | 3 | Interwar/WWII | 1924-1925, all lost 1943 |
| Japan | Furutaka | Heavy Cruiser | 2 | Interwar/WWII | All lost 1942 |
| Britain | Hood | Battlecruiser | 1 | WWI/WWII | Lost 1941 (class of 1) |

**Rare for medium-sized class (6 ships) to be completely annihilated**

**Legacy:** Nagara-class were improved Kuma-class light cruisers. 6 ships (1922-1925), largest 5,500-ton class. Better bridge, improved fire control. Same fast destroyer leader role - 36 knots, 7× 140mm guns, 8× Long Lance torpedoes. All 6 fought entire WWII. **All 6 lost in action** (100% casualty rate - complete annihilation!). Famous actions: Nagara at Midway (witnessed 4 carrier losses), multiple ships at Guadalcanal, Kinu/Abukuma at Leyte Gulf. Losses: Submarines (4 ships), aircraft (2 ships). Isuzu converted to AA cruiser (1944), lasted longest (April 1945). By war's end, not one Nagara-class remained. Of entire 5,500-ton series (14 ships), only Kitakami (Kuma-class) survived. Nagara-class: Workhorses that gave all.

**Historical Significance:** Nagara-class represented peak production of 5,500-ton light cruiser type. 6 ships (largest class: more than Kuma's 5, more than Sendai's 3) showed Japanese commitment to design. Built rapidly 1922-1925 (4 years) during naval expansion era. Same philosophy as Kuma: Speed (36 knots) and offensive power (torpedoes) over protection (2.5-inch belt). Destroyer flotilla leaders - escort, scout, lead night torpedo attacks. Famous ships: Nagara witnessed Midway disaster (all 4 carriers lost June 1942, turning point). Isuzu converted AA cruiser (1944 desperation - air threat overwhelming). 100% loss rate (all 6 destroyed) shows vulnerability: Light armor fatal vs submarines/aircraft. Timeline: First loss October 1942 (Yura), last loss April 1945 (Isuzu) = nearly entire war. October 26, 1944: Two lost in one day (Kinu, Abukuma at Leyte Gulf). Contrast with US contemporaries: Omaha-class light cruisers (all 10 survived WWII). Japanese 5,500-ton type: 14 built, 13 lost (92.9%) vs US Omaha: 10 built, 0 lost. Shows US advantages: Better damage control, air superiority, industrial capacity for repairs. Nagara-class: Fast, aggressive, ultimately sacrificed. None remained to see Japan's surrender. Total annihilation of class - testament to brutal Pacific War.
