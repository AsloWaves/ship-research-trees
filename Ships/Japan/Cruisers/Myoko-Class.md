**Treaty Powerhouses** - Myoko-class were first IJN 10,000-ton treaty heavy cruisers. 4 ships built 1929. Ten 8-inch guns + sixteen 24-inch torpedoes - most heavily armed treaty cruisers. High speed (35.5 knots). All four participated in major Pacific battles. All four sunk 1944-1945 (Myoko survived war but scrapped as constructive total loss).

**Key Specs:** 13,380/15,933 tons | 668ft | 35.5 kn | 10× 203mm + 8× 127mm DP + 16× 610mm torpedoes | 102mm belt | 4 ships

**Innovation:** First IJN treaty cruisers designed to 10,000-ton Washington Treaty limit. Most heavily armed cruisers in world (1929) - ten 8-inch guns, sixteen 24-inch torpedoes. High speed (35.5 knots) for aggressive operations. Set template for all subsequent IJN heavy cruisers. Exceeded treaty limits when fully loaded (15,933 tons) but nominally compliant. Demonstrated Japanese emphasis on offensive firepower over protection. Influenced Takao-class improvements.

**Design:** Ten 8-inch guns in five twin turrets (three forward superfiring, two aft). Sixteen 24-inch torpedo tubes (four quad mounts). Eight 5-inch DP guns. High speed (35.5 knots). Light armor (4-inch belt) for speed. Large bridge structure. Three floatplanes with catapults. Good range (8,000 nm). Emphasis on offensive power - guns and torpedoes. Protection sacrificed for firepower and speed.

**Comparison - Treaty Heavy Cruisers:**
| Class | Nation | Displacement | Main Guns | Torpedoes | Speed |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|

| Takao | Japan | 13,400 | 10× 8" | 16× 24" | 34.2 kn |
| Pensacola | USA | 9,100 | 10× 8" | 0 | 32.5 kn |

**Myoko Survival:**
- Torpedoed December 13, 1944 by USS Bergall
- Bow completely destroyed (50+ feet blown off)
- Limped to Singapore at 8 knots
- Never repaired due to lack of resources
- Surrendered intact August 1945
- Used briefly by Allies, then scuttled 1946
- Only Myoko-class to survive war (barely)

**Legacy:** Myoko-class set template for IJN heavy cruiser design - heavy guns, heavy torpedoes, high speed, light armor. Most heavily armed treaty cruisers when built. All four saw extensive combat across Pacific. Demonstrated offensive-minded Japanese doctrine - firepower over protection. Nachi, Haguro, and Ashigara all lost 1944-1945 in various circumstances (air attack, destroyers, submarine). Haguro's loss in last surface action showed IJN fought to bitter end. Ashigara last major IJN combatant sunk by submarine. Names: Mountains in Japan - Myoko, Nachi, Haguro, Ashigara.

**Historical Significance:** Myoko-class embodied IJN treaty cruiser philosophy - maximum offensive power on treaty displacement. Ten 8-inch guns and sixteen 24-inch torpedoes made them most dangerous cruisers afloat (1929-1935). Combat record extensive - participated in nearly every major campaign 1941-1945. All four lost or constructively destroyed showed attrition of IJN cruiser force. Haguro's last surface action (May 1945) symbolized desperate final resistance. Design influenced all subsequent IJN cruisers. Demonstrated that light armor made cruisers vulnerable despite heavy armament.
