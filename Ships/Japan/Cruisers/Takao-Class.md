- **Battle off Samar** (October 25, 1944): Chokai engaged escort carriers at close range, damaged before being sunk

**Legacy:** Most active IJN heavy cruisers in WWII. Participated in nearly all major surface actions 1942-1944. Devastating victory at Savo Island (Chokai). Atago as Combined Fleet flagship represented IJN power 1942-1944. Loss of Atago and Maya to submarines in Palawan Passage crippled Kurita's force before Battle off Samar. Chokai at Samar came close to destroying escort carriers. Represented peak of IJN treaty cruiser design. Balanced firepower, speed, and torpedoes. All four lost within two years of Pearl Harbor shows attrition of IJN surface forces.

**Historical Significance:** Embodied IJN cruiser doctrine - heavy guns, heavy torpedoes, high speed, light armor. Savo Island victory (Chokai) showed effectiveness of IJN night-fighting tactics and torpedo warfare. Palawan Passage ambush (Atago, Maya) demonstrated submarine threat to even fast, powerful surface ships. Battle off Samar (Chokai) showed desperate nature of IJN operations by late 1944. Only Takao survived war, testament to class's toughness despite light armor.
