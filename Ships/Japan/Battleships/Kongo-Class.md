**British-Built Fast Battleships** - Kongo-class were originally British-designed battlecruisers, later converted to fast battleships. 4 ships (Kongo built UK, others Japan). Most active IJN battleships in WWII. High speed (30+ knots) made them valuable. All 4 sunk 1942-1944.

**Key Specs:** 32,156/36,600 tons | 728ft | 30 kn | 8× 356mm (14") + 14× 152mm + 118× 25mm AA | 203mm belt + bulges | 4 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese dreadnought-type capital ships. Kongo built by Vickers (UK) - last major Japanese warship built abroad. Sisters built in Japan using Kongo as pattern. Originally battlecruisers, twice modernized to fast battleships (1930s). High speed made them most active IJN battleships in WWII. Participated in more battles than any other IJN capital ships.

**Design:** Eight 14-inch guns in four twin turrets (superfiring). Originally lightly armored battlecruisers (British design). Two major reconstructions (1930s) added armor, bulges, replaced boilers/turbines, rebuilt superstructure into pagoda masts. Final configuration: fast battleships with 30-knot speed but still lighter armor than true battleships.

**Ships:**
- **Kongo** - Built Vickers (UK), sunk November 21, 1944 (submarine USS Sealion, Taiwan Strait), 1,250 killed
- **Hiei** - Sunk November 13, 1942 (Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, scuttled after aircraft damage), 188 killed
- **Haruna** - Sunk July 28, 1945 (US carrier aircraft, Kure Harbor, beached), 65 killed
- **Kirishima** - Sunk November 15, 1942 (Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, surface action vs USS Washington), 212 killed

**Construction:**
- **Kongo:** Vickers (Barrow-in-Furness, UK), laid down January 17, 1911, launched May 18, 1912, commissioned August 16, 1913
- **Hiei:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, laid down November 4, 1911, launched November 21, 1912, commissioned August 4, 1914
- **Haruna:** Kawasaki Kobe, laid down March 16, 1912, launched December 14, 1913, commissioned April 19, 1915
- **Kirishima:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down March 17, 1912, launched December 1, 1913, commissioned April 19, 1915

**Modernizations:**
1. **1929-1931 (Major):**
   - Horizontal armor increased (bomb protection)
   - Pagoda mast added
   - Boilers replaced (oil-fired)
   - Hull lengthened 26 feet
   - Speed increased to 26 knots

2. **1936-1940 (Extensive Reconstruction):**
   - Complete rebuild - essentially new ships
   - New boilers and turbines (30-knot speed)
   - Armor increased (deck, belt extensions)
   - Bulges added (torpedo protection)
   - Superstructure rebuilt (distinctive pagoda)
   - Secondary guns reduced, AA greatly increased
   - Aircraft catapults installed
   - Cost: Nearly as much as new battleship

**14-inch/45 Type 41 Gun Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 356mm (14 inches)
- **Barrel length:** 16.2 meters (53.1 feet)
- **Shell weight:** Type 88 AP: 673.5 kg (1,485 lbs) | Type 0 HE: 625 kg (1,378 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 775 m/s (2,543 ft/s)
- **Maximum range:** 35,450 meters (38,770 yards / 22 miles)
- **Rate of fire:** 2 rounds per minute
- **Barrel life:** 250-300 rounds

**Armor Protection (Post-1940):**
- **Belt:** 203mm (8") main belt (light for battleship)
- **Deck:** 100-127mm (3.9-5") increased in modernization
- **Turrets:** 229mm (9") face, 203mm sides, 114mm roof
- **Barbettes:** 254mm (10")
- **Conning tower:** 254mm (10")
- **Bulges:** Added 1936-1940 for torpedo protection (increased beam to 95 ft)
- **Note:** Lighter armor than contemporary battleships (battlecruiser heritage)

**Combat Record:**
- Most combat actions of any IJN capital ships
- **Hiei vs USS San Francisco** (Nov 12-13, 1942): Point-blank night action (1,500-3,000 yards), both heavily damaged
- **Kirishima vs USS Washington** (Nov 14-15, 1942): Washington's radar-directed fire crippled Kirishima in minutes (9× 16" hits)
- **Kongo sunk by submarine:** Only IJN battleship sunk by submarine (USS Sealion), third battleship ever sunk by submarine (after HMS Barham and HMS Royal Oak)
- Indian Ocean raid: Kongo and Haruna sank heavy cruisers HMS Cornwall and HMS Dorsetshire (dive bombers)

**Legacy:** Most active IJN battleships in WWII due to high speed. Participated in more operations than any other IJN capital ships. Anglo-Japanese cooperation product - Kongo built UK, sisters built Japan from British design. Two lost at Guadalcanal in fierce night battles - Hiei first IJN battleship lost in war. Kirishima's loss to USS Washington showed effectiveness of US radar fire control. Kongo's sinking proved even fast battleships vulnerable to submarines. Embodied transition from battlecruiser to fast battleship concept.

**Historical Significance:** Kongo-class bridged WWI battlecruiser and WWII fast battleship concepts. High speed made them valuable throughout war while older, slower battleships (Yamato, Nagato) conserved fuel. Guadalcanal night battles (Hiei, Kirishima) were last pure surface gun battles between capital ships. Demonstrated that speed alone could not compensate for light armor against modern weapons.
