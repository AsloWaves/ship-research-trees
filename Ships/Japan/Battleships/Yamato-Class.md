**Largest Ever** - Yamato-class were largest, most powerful battleships ever built. 2 completed (3rd converted to carrier). 72,800 tons full load. 18.1-inch guns - largest naval guns ever. Sunk by US aircraft 1944-1945.

**Key Specs:** 65,027/72,800 tons | 863ft | 27 kn | 9× 46cm (18.1") + 12× 155mm + 12× 127mm DP | 410mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Largest battleships ever constructed. Most powerful naval guns (46cm/18.1-inch Type 94). Thickest armor ever fitted (650mm turret faces, 410mm belt). Designed to outgun and outfight any battleship afloat. Secret construction - even dimensions classified until after WWII.

**Design:** Nine 46cm guns in three triple turrets, range 42km. Massive armor protection against 16-inch shells. Pagoda mast. Bulbous bow for speed. Secondary battery of 155mm guns in turrets. Heavy AA added during war. Hermetically sealed design against gas/biological attack.

- **Musashi:** Sustained incredible punishment - 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs over 4 hours before sinking
- **Both:** Fell to overwhelming air power, proving battleship era ended

**Legacy:** Symbol of Imperial Japanese Navy. Represented Japan's determination to match Western naval power through quality over quantity. Built in secret - true size unknown to Allies until after war. Wreck of Yamato discovered 1985 (290m depth, Kagoshima). Wreck of Musashi discovered 2015 (1km depth, Sibuyan Sea). Most powerful battleships ever built, yet both destroyed by aircraft - final proof aircraft carrier replaced battleship as capital ship.

**Secrecy:** Construction shrouded in extreme secrecy. Kure Naval Arsenal covered with rope screens. Workers required to sign secrecy oaths. Displacement listed as 65,000 tons (actually 72,800). True specifications not revealed until after WWII. Even dimensions remained classified - US intelligence estimated 45,000-50,000 tons during war.

**Design Philosophy:** "Kantai Kessen" (decisive battle) doctrine. Japan could not match US industrial capacity, so built qualitatively superior ships. Each Yamato-class designed to defeat two US battleships. Armor designed to resist 16-inch shells at 20-30km. Guns could penetrate US 16-inch armor at ranges US guns could not penetrate Yamato's armor.
