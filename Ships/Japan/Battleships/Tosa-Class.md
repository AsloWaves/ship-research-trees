**Cancelled Giants** - Tosa-class were planned super-battleships. 2 ships laid down 1920-1921. Ten 16.1-inch guns, 39,900 tons, 26.5 knots. Would have been most powerful Japanese battleships. Washington Naval Treaty (1922) cancelled both. Tosa ~50% complete - used as target ship 1925 (sunk). Kaga ~20% complete - converted to aircraft carrier (commissioned 1928, sunk Midway 1942). Never completed as battleships. Showed treaty's impact on naval arms race.

**Key Specs (planned):** 39,900/44,200 tons | 761ft | 26.5 kn | 10× 410mm + 20× 140mm | 280mm belt | 0 built

**Innovation:** Post-WWI super-battleships. Ten 16.1-inch (410mm) guns in five twin turrets - most powerful Japanese guns to date (before Yamato's 18.1-inch). Larger than Nagato-class (33,800 vs 39,900 tons). Better armor (11-inch belt). Higher speed (26.5 knots vs 26). All-or-nothing armor scheme. Oil-fired turbines. Modern design for 1920. But Washington Naval Treaty (signed February 1922) ended construction. Tosa became target ship (valuable for testing). Kaga converted to carrier (Midway veteran). Showed treaties could stop arms race cold.

**Design (planned):** Five twin 16.1-inch turrets (three forward, two aft). Twenty single 5.5-inch secondary guns. Four 80mm AA guns (inadequate by later standards). Eight 24-inch submerged torpedo tubes. Heavy armor (11-inch belt, 12-inch turrets, 4-inch deck). Four-shaft turbines (26.5 knots). Oil-fired. All-or-nothing armor scheme (concentrate protection on vitals). Modern fire control. Long but narrow beam (761ft x 100ft). Represented evolution from Nagato to super-battleship.

**Ships (2 planned - 0 completed):**
1. **Tosa** - Cancelled 1922, used as target ship 1925, sunk
2. **Kaga** - Cancelled 1922, converted to aircraft carrier, sunk Midway 1942

**Construction:**

**Tosa:**
- **Builder:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki
- **Laid down:** February 16, 1920
- **Launched:** December 18, 1921
- **Construction progress:** ~50% complete by treaty
- **Fate:** Target ship 1924-1925, sunk

**Kaga:**
- **Builder:** Kawasaki Kobe
- **Laid down:** July 19, 1920
- **Launched:** November 17, 1921 (as battleship hull)
- **Construction progress:** ~20% complete by treaty
- **Fate:** Converted to carrier 1923-1928

**Washington Naval Treaty Context:**

**Treaty Signed:** February 6, 1922
**Provisions:**
- Battleship tonnage limits
  - USA: 525,000 tons
  - Britain: 525,000 tons
  - **Japan: 315,000 tons** (60% of US/UK)
- No new battleships for 10 years ("holiday")
- Existing ships over limit scrapped

**Impact on Japan:**
**Allowed:**
- Nagato, Mutsu (new, powerful, 16-inch guns)
- Fuso, Yamashiro, Ise, Hyuga (14-inch guns)
- Total: 6 modern battleships = ~300,000 tons

**Forced to Cancel/Scrap:**
- **Tosa, Kaga** (under construction - cancelled)
- Amagi, Akagi (battlecruisers - cancelled, one converted)
- Satsuma, Aki (obsolete - scrapped)
- Kawachi (lost 1918), Settsu (demilitarized)

**Japan's Response:**
- Accepted treaty reluctantly
- Kept best 6 battleships
- **Converted Kaga to carrier** (treaty allowed 2 carriers)
- Used Tosa as target (valuable data)

**Tosa as Target Ship:**

**Decision (1922):**
- Tosa ~50% complete
- Too valuable to scrap immediately
- Use as target for weapon tests
- Study armor, damage control

**Testing (1924-1925):**
**Weapons Tested:**
- 203mm (8-inch) cruiser guns
- 305mm (12-inch) battleship guns
- 410mm (16.1-inch) battleship guns (Nagato)
- Torpedoes (aerial and submarine)
- Bombs (from aircraft)

**Results:**
- Armor penetration data
- Flooding patterns
- Structural strength
- Damage control challenges
- Valuable for future designs

**Final Test (1925):**
- **Massive attack** - multiple hits
- Hull gradually flooded
- **Eventually sank**
- Data collected throughout
- Influenced Yamato-class design (1937)

**Kaga Conversion to Carrier:**

**Decision (1922):**
- Kaga ~20% complete as battleship
- Treaty allowed Japan 81,000 tons carriers
- **Convert Kaga to carrier**
- Use existing hull (faster than new build)

**Conversion (1923-1928):**
- Battleship hull modified
- Flight deck added
- Hangar decks installed
- Island added (later modified)
- Machinery completed
- **Commissioned:** March 31, 1928

**Kaga as Carrier:**
- Pearl Harbor attack (1941)
- Battle of Coral Sea (1942)
- **Battle of Midway (June 1942):** Sunk by US dive bombers
- One of four carriers lost at Midway
- **Most successful "cancelled battleship"** - became famous carrier

**410mm/45 Gun Specifications:**
**As Designed (never built):**
- **Caliber:** 410mm (16.1 inches)
- **Shell weight:** 1,020 kg (2,250 lbs) - estimated
- **Muzzle velocity:** 780 m/s - estimated
- **Maximum range:** 35,000 meters - estimated
- Would have been most powerful Japanese guns until Yamato's 18.1-inch

**Comparison - Cancelled Battleships:**
| Ship | Nation | Cancelled | Guns | Fate |
|------|--------|-----------|------|------|
| **Tosa** | **Japan** | **1922** | **10× 16.1"** | **Target ship** |
| **Kaga** | **Japan** | **1922** | **10× 16.1"** | **Converted to carrier** |
| South Dakota (1920) | USA | 1922 | 12× 16" | Scrapped incomplete |
| Lexington | USA | 1922 | 8× 16" | Converted to carrier |

**Why Cancelled:**

**Washington Treaty Goals:**
1. **End arms race:** Stop expensive battleship construction
2. **Reduce tensions:** Limit naval competition
3. **Save money:** Great Depression approaching
4. **Maintain peace:** Prevent war through limits

**Result:**
- "Battleship holiday" 1922-1936
- Tosa, Kaga cancelled
- Arms race paused (temporarily)
- Money saved
- But: Limits chafed Japan (60% vs US/UK 100%)

**If Completed (Hypothetical):**

**Tosa and Kaga as Battleships:**
**Strengths:**
- 16.1-inch guns (powerful)
- Heavy armor (11-inch belt)
- Modern design
- Good speed (26.5 knots)

**vs Nagato-class:**
- Heavier (39,900 vs 33,800 tons)
- Same guns (16.1-inch)
- Better armor
- Similar speed

**Impact:**
- Would have strengthened IJN
- But: Treaty prevented it
- Kaga as carrier proved more valuable (Midway veteran)

**Tosa Testing Data:**

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Armor effectiveness:** 11-inch belt good but not invulnerable
2. **Torpedo damage:** Underwater hits catastrophic
3. **Bomb damage:** Deck armor critical (influenced Yamato)
4. **Flooding control:** Compartmentation vital
5. **Structural integrity:** Design validated

**Applied to:**
- Yamato-class design (1937-1941)
- Improved armor schemes
- Better damage control
- Stronger structures

**Legacy:** Tosa-class represented Japan's cancelled super-battleship ambitions. Ten 16.1-inch guns, 39,900 tons - would have been most powerful Japanese battleships (until Yamato). Washington Treaty (1922) cancelled both. Tosa used as target ship (1924-1925) - valuable testing data influenced Yamato design. Kaga converted to carrier - fought Pearl Harbor, sunk Midway (more famous as carrier than would have been as battleship). Showed treaties could end arms race. But also showed Japanese resentment of 60% ratio. Influenced later illegal construction (Yamato exceeded treaty limits). Names: Provinces (Tosa, Kaga).

**Historical Significance:** Tosa-class epitomized Washington Treaty's impact. Construction begun 1920-1921, cancelled 1922 by treaty. Would have been Japan's most powerful battleships but never completed. Tosa ~50% complete, became target ship - data used for Yamato design. Kaga ~20% complete, converted to carrier - became Pearl Harbor veteran, died at Midway. Ironically, Kaga as carrier more valuable and famous than she would have been as battleship. Treaty paused arms race but bred resentment - Japan felt discriminated by 60% ratio (vs 100% for US/UK). Led to eventual treaty denunciation (1936) and unrestricted building (Yamato exceeded all limits). Tosa-class: What might have been vs what was needed. Carriers proved more valuable than battleships - Kaga's fate proved this perfectly.
