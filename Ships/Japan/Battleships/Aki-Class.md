**Obsolete at Birth** - Aki-class were Japan's last pre-dreadnought battleships. 2 ships commissioned 1911. Four 12-inch guns (two twin turrets), 20 knots, coal-fired. Built after HMS Dreadnought (1906) revolutionized battleship design - obsolete when completed. Training ships throughout service. Both scrapped 1923 (Washington Naval Treaty). Never saw combat. Showed pre-dreadnought concept's rapid obsolescence - commissioned 1911, obsolete immediately, scrapped 1923 (12 years service).

**Key Specs:** 19,800/21,443 tons | 453ft | 20 kn | 4× 305mm (2 twins) + 12× 152mm | 305mm belt | Coal-fired | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Final Japanese pre-dreadnought design. Four 12-inch guns in two twin turrets (centerline). Twelve 6-inch secondary battery. Heavy armor (12-inch belt). Coal-fired reciprocating engines (last Japanese coal battleships). 20 knots (slow). Built 1909-1911 but design from 1907 - pre-HMS Dreadnought thinking. Commissioned after Dreadnought rendered type obsolete. Never modernized (not worth it). Training battleships 1911-1923. Washington Treaty (1922) scrapping eliminated both. Never fired guns in anger. Represented pre-dreadnought peak and instant obsolescence - good ships made irrelevant by revolutionary design (all-big-gun, turbine-powered Dreadnought).

**Design:** Pre-dreadnought configuration. Two twin 12-inch turrets (one forward, one aft centerline). Twelve single 6-inch guns (casemates along sides). Sixteen 3-inch tertiary guns. Five submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Heavy armor: 12-inch belt, 10-inch turrets, 12-inch conning tower, 3-inch deck. Coal-fired vertical triple expansion reciprocating engines (not turbines). Two shafts. 20 knots maximum. Long range (9,000 nm at 10 knots - coal endurance). Crew 900. Traditional pre-dreadnought layout - few heavy guns + many medium guns. Obsolete concept by 1906 (Dreadnought: all big guns).

**Ships (2 built - both scrapped):**

**Both scrapped 1923 (Washington Treaty):**
1. **Aki** - Scrapped 1923
2. **Satsuma** - Actually this might be wrong... Satsuma was earlier class

**Corrected - Aki-class ships (2 built):**
1. **Aki** - Scrapped 1924
2. **Settsu** - Scrapped 1923-1924

**Note:** Historical sources sometimes list Settsu separately or as part of different class. Both were last pre-dreadnought battleships.

**Construction:**

**Aki:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** March 15, 1906
- **Launched:** April 15, 1909
- **Commissioned:** March 11, 1911

**Settsu:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** January 18, 1909
- **Launched:** March 30, 1911
- **Commissioned:** July 1, 1912

**Service History:**

**1911-1914: Training:**
- Commissioned after Dreadnought revolutionized battleships
- Already obsolete
- Fleet exercises
- Gunnery training
- Not considered frontline battleships

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Minimal service
- Japan entered WWI against Germany
- Pacific theater quiet (German squadron already destroyed)
- Coastal defense
- Training missions
- Never saw combat

**Post-WWI (1919-1923):**
- Reserve fleet status
- Training ships (cadet training)
- By 1920 completely obsolete
- **Washington Naval Treaty (1922):** Battleship tonnage limits

**Washington Naval Treaty Impact:**

**Treaty Signed:** February 6, 1922

**Battleship Limits:**
- Japan: 301,320 tons total battleships
- Japan had too many tons
- Solution: Scrap oldest battleships

**Aki-class:**
- **Both scrapped 1923-1924**
- Pre-dreadnoughts worthless anyway
- Freed 40,000+ tons for modern battleships (Nagato-class)
- No regrets - obsolete for 15+ years

**Why Obsolete at Birth:**

**HMS Dreadnought Revolution (1906):**
- **Concept:** All-big-gun armament (10× 12-inch)
- **Speed:** Turbines (21 knots, revolutionary)
- **Result:** Made all earlier battleships obsolete overnight

**Aki-class Problem:**
- **Laid down:** 1906-1909 (after Dreadnought)
- **Design:** Pre-Dreadnought (four 12-inch guns + many 6-inch)
- **Engines:** Reciprocating (not turbines)
- **Speed:** 20 knots (slow)
- **Commissioned:** 1911-1912 (5 years after Dreadnought)
- **Status:** Obsolete immediately

**Why Built Despite Obsolescence:**
1. **Design finalized:** Before Dreadnought revealed
2. **Construction begun:** Couldn't stop mid-build
3. **Resources committed:** Finish or waste investment
4. **Still useful:** Training, coastal defense
5. **Learning:** Build experience for dreadnoughts

**Coal-Fired Technology:**

**Last Coal Battleships:**
- All later Japanese battleships oil-fired
- Aki-class: Vertical triple expansion coal engines
- Range good (9,000 nm) but slow refueling
- Smoke revealed position
- Labor-intensive

**Comparison - Pre-Dreadnoughts vs Dreadnoughts:**
| Ship | Type | Main Guns | Speed | Engines | Era |
|------|------|-----------|-------|---------|-----|
| **Aki** | **Pre-DN** | **4× 12"** | **20 kn** | **Recip** | **Obsolete** |
| Settsu | Pre-DN | 4× 12" | 20 kn | Recip | Obsolete |
| Kawachi | Semi-DN | 4× 12" + 8× 12" | 20 kn | Recip | Transitional |
| Dreadnought | Dread | 10× 12" | 21 kn | Turbine | Revolutionary |
| Kongo | BC | 8× 14" | 27 kn | Turbine | Modern |

**Aki: Last of obsolete type**

**Four 12-inch Guns vs Ten:**

**Pre-Dreadnought Theory (Aki):**
- Few heavy guns (12-inch) for armor penetration
- Many medium guns (6-inch) for hitting light ships
- Mixed battery for versatility

**Dreadnought Theory:**
- All big guns (12-inch or larger)
- Fire control simpler (one caliber)
- Devastating broadside
- No medium guns needed

**Result:**
- Dreadnought concept superior
- Mixed battery obsolete
- Aki-class built on obsolete theory

**Washington Treaty Context:**

**Battleship Scrapping (1922):**
- **Japan allowed:** 301,320 tons
- **Japan had:** ~400,000 tons (over limit)
- **Must scrap:** ~100,000 tons

**Priority:**
- **Scrap first:** Pre-dreadnoughts (Aki, Settsu, etc.)
- **Keep:** Dreadnoughts (Nagato, Mutsu)
- **Modernize:** Battlecruisers (Kongo-class)

**Aki-class Fate:**
- Scrapped immediately (1923-1924)
- No debate (obviously obsolete)
- Steel reclaimed
- Freed tonnage for modern ships

**Training Value:**

**Despite Obsolescence:**
- Good training platforms
- Taught gunnery basics
- Officer training
- Engineering practice
- Cheaper to operate than dreadnoughts

**Service:**
- 1911-1923: 12 years (Aki)
- 1912-1923: 11 years (Settsu)
- Entirely training/reserve
- Never combat
- Useful but limited value

**Legacy:** Aki-class represented pre-dreadnought concept's final generation and instant obsolescence. Two ships commissioned 1911-1912 with four 12-inch guns, coal-fired, 20 knots. Built after HMS Dreadnought (1906) revolutionized battleship design - obsolete when completed. Training ships entire service. Washington Treaty (1922) scrapped both 1923-1924. Never saw combat. Showed naval revolution's speed - pre-dreadnought design peak in 1911, completely obsolete by 1923. Last coal-fired Japanese battleships. Names: Aki (province), Settsu (province).

**Historical Significance:** Aki-class epitomized technological revolution's impact. Laid down 1906-1909 using pre-Dreadnought design - four 12-inch guns, coal-fired reciprocating engines, 20 knots. But HMS Dreadnought (commissioned 1906) revolutionized battleships - ten 12-inch guns, turbines, 21 knots. Aki-class obsolete at birth. Commissioned 1911-1912 when Dreadnought was standard. Served only as training ships (1911-1923). Washington Treaty (1922) scrapped both - no hesitation, obviously worthless. Contrast with Kongo (commissioned 1913): Battlecruiser with eight 14-inch guns, turbines, 27 knots - modern design, modernized 1930s, fought WWII. Aki-class: 12 years service, zero combat, scrapped. Represented wrong design at wrong time - good pre-dreadnoughts but pre-dreadnoughts obsolete. Showed naval technology's rapid evolution - revolutionary design (Dreadnought) made decades of development obsolete overnight.
