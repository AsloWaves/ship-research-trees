**Semi-Dreadnoughts** - Satsuma-class were Japan's largest pre-dreadnought battleships. 2 ships commissioned 1910-1911. Mixed main battery: Four 12-inch + twelve 10-inch guns. 18.5 knots. Obsolete when completed (HMS Dreadnought launched 1906). Never saw combat. Both scrapped 1922-1923 under Washington Naval Treaty. Represented Japan's pre-dreadnought peak before Kawachi-class true dreadnoughts.

**Key Specs:** 19,700/20,100 tons | 482ft | 18.5 kn | 4× 305mm + 12× 254mm | 230mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Semi-dreadnought design - mixed caliber main battery (12-inch + 10-inch). Originally planned as all-big-gun design (twelve 12-inch guns) but British 12-inch turrets delayed. Compromised with four 12-inch (British) + twelve 10-inch (Japanese). Result: Obsolete when completed. HMS Dreadnought (1906) made mixed-battery obsolete. But showed Japan's ambition - largest Japanese battleships to date. Never saw combat. Scrapped young (12-13 years old) under Washington Treaty.

**Design:** Mixed main battery. Two twin 12-inch turrets (one forward, one aft). Six twin 10-inch turrets (amidships, three each side). Twelve 4.7-inch tertiary guns (anti-torpedo boat). Five 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes. Reciprocating engines (18.5 knots). Coal-fired. Heavy armor (9-inch belt, 9-inch turrets). Pre-dreadnought style but largest yet for Japan. Tall military masts. Typical 1910 design - obsolete by launch.

**Ships (2 built - both scrapped):**
1. **Satsuma** - Scrapped 1922-1923 (Washington Naval Treaty)
2. **Aki** - Scrapped 1923-1924 (Washington Naval Treaty)

**Construction:**

**Satsuma:**
- **Builder:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** May 15, 1905
- **Launched:** November 15, 1906 (same year as HMS Dreadnought)
- **Commissioned:** March 25, 1910

**Aki:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** March 15, 1906
- **Launched:** April 15, 1907
- **Commissioned:** March 11, 1911

**Service History:**

**Peacetime Service (1910-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- Gunnery practice
- Already obsolete (dreadnoughts in service elsewhere)
- Showed flag

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Limited service
- Japan's role in WWI minor
- No combat
- Patrols
- Training continued

**Post-WWI (1918-1922):**
- Training ships
- Gunnery practice
- Obsolete for frontline
- Maintained in reserve

**Washington Naval Treaty (1921-1922):**
**Treaty Signed:** February 1922
**Provisions:**
- Battleship tonnage limits for major powers
- Japan: 315,000 tons total
- Old battleships scrapped

**Japan's Response:**
- Kept: Nagato, Mutsu (new, 16-inch guns)
- Kept: Fuso, Yamashiro, Ise, Hyuga (14-inch guns)
- **Scrapped: Satsuma, Aki** (obsolete, weak, slow)
- Also scrapped: Kawachi-class survivor Settsu (demilitarized)

**1922-1924: Scrapping:**
- Both broken up in Japan
- Steel salvaged
- 12-13 years service
- Never fired shot in anger

**Why Semi-Dreadnought:**

**Original Design (1905):**
- Planned with **twelve 12-inch guns**
- Would have been true dreadnought (before HMS Dreadnought!)
- All-big-gun concept

**Problem:**
- British delayed 12-inch turret delivery
- Japan couldn't build enough 12-inch guns quickly
- Design compromised

**Compromise (1906):**
- Four 12-inch guns (British-made turrets)
- Twelve 10-inch guns (Japanese-made)
- Result: Semi-dreadnought (mixed caliber)

**Tragedy:**
- **If completed as planned:** First true dreadnought (before HMS Dreadnought!)
- **Reality:** Obsolete semi-dreadnought

**HMS Dreadnought Impact:**
**1906:** HMS Dreadnought launched
- Ten 12-inch guns
- All-big-gun design
- Made all previous battleships obsolete
- **Including Satsuma-class** (still under construction)

**Result:**
- Satsuma launched November 1906 (8 months after Dreadnought)
- Already obsolete
- Commissioned 1910 as second-rate ship

**Why Mixed Caliber Bad:**

**Fire Control Issues:**
- 12-inch shells: Different trajectory, time of flight
- 10-inch shells: Different trajectory, time of flight
- **Ranging difficult** - couldn't tell which guns hit
- Spotting fall of shot impossible
- Effective range reduced

**Dreadnought Advantage:**
- All same caliber
- Easier fire control
- More effective firepower
- Longer range engagements possible

**305mm/45 and 254mm/45 Gun Specifications:**

**12-inch (305mm):**
- **Shell weight:** 386 kg (850 lbs)
- **Maximum range:** 20,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 2 rounds per minute

**10-inch (254mm):**
- **Shell weight:** 227 kg (500 lbs)
- **Maximum range:** 18,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 3 rounds per minute

**Comparison - Pre-Dreadnought Era:**
| Ship | Nation | Completed | Main Guns | Mixed Caliber | Speed | Fate |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|------|
| **Satsuma** | **Japan** | **1910** | **4× 12" + 12× 10"** | **Yes** | **18.5 kn** | **Scrapped 1922** |
| **Aki** | **Japan** | **1911** | **4× 12" + 12× 10"** | **Yes** | **18.5 kn** | **Scrapped 1923** |
| Dreadnought | UK | 1906 | 10× 12" | No (all 12") | 21 kn | Scrapped 1923 |
| Michigan | USA | 1910 | 8× 12" | No (all 12") | 18.5 kn | Scrapped 1924 |

**Obsolete Before Completion:**
**Timeline:**
- **1905:** Satsuma laid down (planned as all 12-inch)
- **1906:** HMS Dreadnought launched (all-big-gun)
- **1906:** Satsuma launched (compromised as mixed)
- **1910:** Satsuma commissioned (already obsolete 4 years)

**Lesson:** Technology can outpace construction

**Washington Naval Treaty Context:**

**Why Scrapped:**
1. **Obsolete:** Semi-dreadnought design
2. **Weak:** Only four 12-inch guns vs 8-12 on dreadnoughts
3. **Slow:** 18.5 knots vs 21-23 for newer ships
4. **Old:** Reciprocating engines, coal-fired
5. **Treaty:** Japan needed tonnage for modern ships

**Kept Instead:**
- Nagato, Mutsu: 16-inch guns, 26 knots, oil-fired
- Fuso-class: 14-inch guns, 24 knots
- Ise-class: 14-inch guns, 25 knots

**Decision: Easy** - Satsuma/Aki clearly inferior

**If They Had Fought:**
*Hypothetical*

**Strengths:**
- Heavy armor (9-inch belt)
- Sixteen main guns (4× 12" + 12× 10")
- Japanese build quality

**Weaknesses:**
- Mixed caliber (fire control poor)
- Slow (18.5 knots - couldn't catch or escape)
- Old reciprocating engines (unreliable)
- Coal-fired (less efficient)
- Pre-dreadnought design

**Likely Result:**
- Outranged by dreadnoughts
- Couldn't catch faster enemies
- Mixed caliber ineffective at range
- Would lose to any dreadnought

**Never Tested:** Both scrapped without combat

**Legacy:** Satsuma-class represented Japan's transition from pre-dreadnought to dreadnought era. Originally designed as all-big-gun ships (would have been revolutionary). Compromised due to turret delays - became semi-dreadnoughts. Obsolete when commissioned (1910-1911). HMS Dreadnought (1906) made mixed-caliber obsolete. Never saw combat. Scrapped young (12-13 years) under Washington Treaty. Showed rapid technological change - cutting edge design (1905) obsolete by launch (1906). Taught Japan lessons for Kawachi, Fuso, Nagato classes. Names: Provinces (Satsuma, Aki).

**Historical Significance:** Satsuma-class epitomized technological disruption. Designed 1905 as revolutionary all-big-gun battleships (twelve 12-inch guns planned). Would have beaten HMS Dreadnought to concept! But turret delays forced compromise - four 12-inch + twelve 10-inch (semi-dreadnought). Meanwhile, HMS Dreadnought launched 1906 with ten 12-inch all-big-gun design, making mixed-caliber obsolete. Satsuma commissioned 1910 as already-obsolete ship. Never fought. Scrapped 1922-1923 (Washington Treaty) after 12-13 years peacetime service. Tragic "what if" - had original design completed, Japan would have led dreadnought revolution. Instead, expensive obsolete ships. Lesson learned: Technology moves faster than construction - influenced rapid Japanese shipbuilding later (Yamato-class fastest battleship construction ever).
