**First Dreadnoughts** - Kawachi-class were Japan's first dreadnought battleships. 2 ships commissioned 1912. Twelve 12-inch guns (four twins + four singles). 20.5 knots. Reciprocating engines (obsolete). Kawachi lost July 1918 to magazine explosion (peacetime disaster, 600+ killed). Settsu survived WWI, converted to target ship 1924, survived WWII as hulk, scrapped 1946-1947. Obsolete by WWII but Settsu used for training.

**Key Specs:** 21,420/22,600 tons | 526ft | 20.5 kn | 12× 305mm + 10× 152mm | 305mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Japan's first true dreadnought battleships (all-big-gun design). Twelve 12-inch guns - unusual mixed layout (four twin turrets + four single turrets). Reciprocating engines (old technology) instead of turbines. Heavy armor (12-inch belt). Slow (20.5 knots) compared to later battleships. Built to compete with Dreadnought (1906). Represented Japan's entry into dreadnought arms race. Kawachi tragically lost to magazine explosion (1918) in peacetime. Settsu survived as target ship, helped train crews that fought WWII.

**Design:** Mixed main battery armament - unusual layout. Four twin 12-inch turrets (two forward superfiring, two aft superfiring). Four single 12-inch turrets (amidships). Ten 6-inch secondary guns. Sixteen 4.7-inch tertiary guns (anti-torpedo boat). Five 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes. Reciprocating engines (25,000 shp, 20.5 knots). Coal-fired with oil supplement. Heavy armor (12-inch belt, 11-inch turrets). Tripod mainmast. Typical dreadnought layout for 1912 but mixed turrets unusual.

**Ships (2 built):**
1. **Kawachi** - Sunk July 12, 1918 (magazine explosion, Tokuyama Bay), 600-621 killed
2. **Settsu** - Demilitarized 1923 (Washington Treaty), target ship 1924-1945, scrapped 1946-1947

**Construction:**

**Kawachi:**
- **Builder:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** April 1, 1909
- **Launched:** October 15, 1910
- **Commissioned:** March 31, 1912

**Settsu:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** January 18, 1909
- **Launched:** March 30, 1911
- **Commissioned:** July 1, 1912

**Service History:**

**Kawachi (1912-1918):**

**1912-1914: Peacetime Service:**
- Fleet exercises
- Training cruises
- Gunnery practice
- Flag showing

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Limited action (Japan's role minor)
- Patrols
- Training
- No combat against German forces

**July 12, 1918 - Magazine Explosion:**
*Peacetime disaster*

**Background:**
- Kawachi at anchor in Tokuyama Bay (Inland Sea)
- Routine peacetime operations
- No combat, no enemy action

**12:05 PM:**
- **Massive explosion in forward magazine**
- Cause unknown (possibly unstable ammunition)
- Entire bow destroyed
- Forward turrets blown off
- Ship immediately began sinking

**12:20 PM:**
- **Second explosion** (aft magazine)
- Stern destroyed
- **Kawachi broke in half**
- **Capsized and sank rapidly**

**Casualties:**
- **600-621 killed** (reports vary)
- ~200-300 survivors
- One of worst peacetime naval disasters
- Entire forward and aft gun crews lost

**Cause:**
- **Never definitively determined**
- Likely causes:
  1. Unstable ammunition (cordite deterioration)
  2. Overheated magazine (hot weather)
  3. Sabotage (investigated, no evidence)
  4. Accidental ignition
- Similar to HMS Vanguard explosion (1917, 843 killed)

**Impact:**
- Japan's worst peacetime naval disaster to date
- Led to improved ammunition storage procedures
- Magazine cooling systems upgraded fleet-wide
- Ammunition handling procedures revised

**Settsu (1912-1947):**

**1912-1918: Active Service:**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- WWI patrols (limited)
- Sister to Kawachi

**1918-1923: Post-Kawachi:**
- After Kawachi loss, Settsu handled carefully
- Magazine procedures improved
- Training continued
- Obsolete by 1920s (turbine battleships superior)

**1923 - Washington Naval Treaty:**
- Treaty limited battleship tonnage
- Japan kept newer battleships (Nagato, Mutsu)
- **Settsu disarmed** (turrets removed)
- Demilitarized but kept as hulk

**1924-1945: Target Ship:**
- Converted to **target ship**
- Main guns removed
- Used for:
  - Bombing practice (aircraft)
  - Gunnery practice (ships)
  - Torpedo practice
  - Damage control training
- Took extensive punishment
- Tough ship - survived decades of battering

**1945 - Kure:**
- At Kure when war ended
- Heavily damaged hulk
- Essentially floating wreck
- But still afloat (testament to construction)

**1946-1947: Scrapping:**
- Broken up
- 35 years service (1912-1947)
- 21 years as target (1924-1945)
- Longest-serving Japanese battleship hull

**Kawachi Magazine Explosion Details:**

**Forensic Analysis:**
**Ammunition Issues:**
- 1918 - hot summer
- Magazines inadequately cooled
- Cordite propellant unstable in heat
- Chemical breakdown produces flammable gases
- Spark or heat could ignite

**Similar Incidents:**
- **HMS Vanguard (1917):** Magazine explosion, 843 killed
- **HMS Bulwark (1914):** Magazine explosion, 736 killed
- **IJN Mutsu (1943):** Magazine explosion, 1,121 killed
- Pattern: Magazine safety critical

**Lessons:**
- Temperature control vital
- Ammunition inspection regular
- Cordite shelf life limited
- Magazine ventilation crucial

**305mm/45 Gun Specifications:**
- First Japanese 12-inch guns
- **Caliber:** 305mm (12 inches)
- **Shell weight:** 386 kg (850 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 850 m/s
- **Maximum range:** 20,000-22,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 2 rounds per minute

**Comparison - Early Dreadnoughts:**
| Ship | Nation | Completed | Main Guns | Speed | Propulsion | Fate |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|------------|------|
| **Kawachi** | **Japan** | **1912** | **12× 12"** | **20.5 kn** | **Reciprocating** | **Magazine explosion** |
| **Settsu** | **Japan** | **1912** | **12× 12"** | **20.5 kn** | **Reciprocating** | **Target ship, scrapped** |
| Dreadnought | UK | 1906 | 10× 12" | 21 kn | Turbine | Scrapped 1923 |
| South Carolina | USA | 1910 | 8× 12" | 18.5 kn | Reciprocating | Scrapped 1924 |

**Why Reciprocating Engines:**
**Design Decision (1909):**
- Turbines new technology
- Japan uncertain of turbine reliability
- Reciprocating engines proven
- Conservative choice
- **Result:** Obsolete immediately
- Later battleships all turbine

**Why Mixed Turret Layout:**
**Design Compromise:**
- Four twin turrets (modern)
- Four single turrets (traditional)
- Transition design
- Space limitations
- Weight distribution
- Later battleships: All twin/triple turrets

**Washington Naval Treaty Impact (1922):**

**Japan's Response:**
- Allowed to keep: Nagato, Mutsu (newer)
- **Settsu disarmed** (old, slow, obsolete)
- Kawachi already lost (1918)
- Treaty actually helped - forced scrapping of obsolete ships

**Settsu's Survival:**
- Kept as target ship (treaty allowed)
- More useful than scrapping immediately
- Trained gunners and pilots
- Tested weapons
- Damage control practice

**Why Settsu Survived So Long:**
**As Target Ship (1924-1945):**
1. **Tough construction:** 12-inch armor belt
2. **Low value:** Already obsolete, damage didn't matter
3. **Useful role:** Training essential
4. **Treaty limits:** Couldn't build new targets
5. **Cost:** Free target vs expensive new construction

**Result:** 21 years of abuse (1924-1945), still afloat

**Legacy:** Kawachi-class represented Japan's entry into dreadnought arms race. First Japanese all-big-gun battleships (1912). Unusual mixed armament (twin + single turrets). Reciprocating engines (obsolete choice). Kawachi tragically lost to magazine explosion (1918, 600+ killed) - led to improved ammunition safety fleet-wide. Settsu demilitarized 1923 (Washington Treaty), served 21 years as target ship (1924-1945), finally scrapped 1946-1947. Showed dreadnought transition challenges - mixed turrets, old engines, magazine safety issues. Settsu's 35-year hull life (1912-1947) longest of any Japanese battleship hull. Names: Provinces (Kawachi, Settsu - both modern Osaka area).

**Historical Significance:** Kawachi-class marked Japan's arrival as dreadnought power. Built 1909-1912, joined arms race started by HMS Dreadnought (1906). But design flaws visible - reciprocating engines obsolete, mixed turret layout awkward, magazine safety poor. Kawachi's magazine explosion (1918, 600+ killed) Japan's worst peacetime naval disaster, exposed ammunition handling dangers. Lessons learned applied fleet-wide. Settsu luckier - demilitarized 1923 (Washington Treaty), became target ship 1924. Survived 21 years of bombing, shelling, torpedoing practice. Finally scrapped 1946-1947 after 35 years. Showed rapid obsolescence - cutting-edge 1912, target practice 1924, only 12 years. Represented learning phase for Japanese battleship design - Fuso, Nagato, Yamato classes far superior. But Kawachi/Settsu taught lessons that saved lives later.
