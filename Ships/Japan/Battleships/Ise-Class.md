**Hybrid Battleship-Carriers** - Ise-class were unique battleships converted to hybrid carriers 1943. 2 ships. Aft turrets removed, flight deck and hangar added. 22 aircraft capacity but no catapult - seaplane bombers launched by crane. 8× 14-inch guns forward. Desperate measure to add carriers after Midway losses. Both sunk 1945.

**Key Specs:** 35,800/38,675 tons | 717ft | 25 kn | 8× 356mm (14") + 22 aircraft + 16× 127mm DP | 305mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Only battleships converted to hybrid carriers. Radical 1943 conversion - removed aft two turrets (X and Y), added 230-foot flight deck, hangar, and aircraft crane. Could operate 22 floatplanes (no catapult - lowered to water by crane). Desperate attempt to add carrier capacity after Midway disaster. Proved impractical - difficult to operate aircraft, slow recovery. Never used operationally as hybrid carriers.

**Design (Original 1917):** Twelve 14-inch guns in six twin turrets (superfiring fore and aft, plus two wing turrets amidships). Improved Fuso-class with better armor distribution. Standard WWI battleship layout. Pagoda mast added in 1930s modernization.

**Design (1943 Hybrid Conversion):**
- **Forward section:** 4 twin turrets (8× 14-inch guns) retained
- **Aft section:** Turrets X and Y removed, replaced with:
  - 230-foot flight deck (too short for takeoff/landing)
  - Hangar below deck (22 aircraft capacity)
  - Two large cranes to lower/recover seaplanes
  - Aircraft: D4Y Judy dive bombers (floatplane conversion)
- **Purpose:** Launch bombers for reconnaissance/attack, recover by crane from water
- **Reality:** Too slow and impractical, never used operationally

**Ships:**
- **Ise** - Sunk July 28, 1945 (US carrier aircraft, Kure Harbor, capsized in shallow water)
- **Hyuga** - Sunk July 24, 1945 (US carrier aircraft, Kure Harbor, beached in shallow water)

**Construction:**
- **Ise:** Kawasaki Kobe, laid down May 10, 1915, launched November 12, 1916, commissioned December 15, 1917
- **Hyuga:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down May 6, 1915, launched January 27, 1917, commissioned April 30, 1918

**Conversion (1943):**
- **Ise:** September 1942 - November 1943 (Kure Naval Arsenal)
- **Hyuga:** May 1943 - November 1943 (Sasebo Naval Arsenal)
- Both completed November 1943
- Cost: Nearly as much as building new carrier
- Air group training delayed - never deployed operationally

**Service - Ise (1917-1945):**
- **WWI:** Patrol duties (completed after war ended)
- **1920s-1930s:** Training, fleet operations
- **1936-1937:** Major modernization (pagoda mast, new boilers, armor upgrade)
- **1937-1941:** China operations, training
- **WWII (1941-1942):** Battle of Midway (support force), limited operations
- **1942-1943:** Hybrid conversion at Kure
- **October 1944:** Battle of Leyte Gulf (Northern Force/Cape Engaño) - decoy force, undamaged
- **1945:** Fuel shortages, immobile at Kure
- **July 28, 1945:** Sunk by US carrier aircraft (Operation Transom), capsized

**Service - Hyuga (1918-1945):**
- **WWI:** Too late for combat
- **1920s-1930s:** Training, fleet operations
- **1936-1937:** Major modernization
- **1937-1941:** China operations, training
- **WWII (1941-1942):** Battle of Midway (support force), limited operations
- **1943:** Hybrid conversion at Sasebo
- **October 1944:** Battle of Leyte Gulf (Northern Force/Cape Engaño) - decoy force, undamaged
- **1945:** Immobile at Kure
- **July 24, 1945:** Sunk by US carrier aircraft, beached in shallow water

**Battle of Leyte Gulf - Cape Engaño (October 25, 1944):**
- Part of Admiral Ozawa's Northern Force (4 carriers, 2 hybrid battleships)
- **Mission:** Decoy Halsey's Third Fleet away from Leyte Gulf
- Successfully drew away Halsey (carriers Zuikaku, Zuiho, Chitose, Chiyoda all sunk)
- **Ise and Hyuga:** Survived battle undamaged despite heavy air attacks
- Only capital ships to survive Cape Engaño
- Achievement overshadowed by failure - Kurita's Center Force retreated from Samar

**14-inch/45 Type 41 Gun Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 356mm (14 inches)
- **Barrel length:** 16.2 meters (53.1 feet)
- **Shell weight:** Type 88 AP: 673.5 kg (1,485 lbs) | Type 0 HE: 625 kg (1,378 lbs)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 775 m/s (2,543 ft/s)
- **Maximum range:** 35,450 meters (38,770 yards / 22 miles)
- **Rate of fire:** 2 rounds per minute

**Aircraft Complement (Planned):**
- **22× D4Y3 Model 33 "Judy"** (floatplane conversion)
  - Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber modified with floats
  - Two-seat reconnaissance/dive bomber
  - Speed: 343 mph (552 km/h)
  - Bomb load: 1× 550 kg (1,213 lb) bomb
- **Launch:** Lowered to water by large cranes
- **Recovery:** Land in water, hoisted back by crane
- **Problem:** Very slow recovery process (15-20 minutes per aircraft)

**Why Conversion Failed:**
1. **No catapult:** Couldn't launch aircraft from deck (too short)
2. **Slow recovery:** Crane launch/recovery took 15-20 minutes per aircraft
3. **Vulnerable:** Ship stopped to recover aircraft - easy submarine target
4. **Training incomplete:** Air crews never fully trained by war's end
5. **Fuel shortages:** Ships immobilized by lack of fuel oil
6. **Never used:** Aircraft never embarked operationally

**Armor Protection (Post-1937):**
- **Belt:** 305mm (12") main belt
- **Deck:** 55-114mm (2.2-4.5") increased in modernization
- **Turrets:** 279mm (11") face, 203mm sides, 114mm roof
- **Barbettes:** 305mm (12")
- **Conning tower:** 305mm (12")
- **Anti-torpedo bulges:** Added 1936-1937

**Comparison to Fleet Carriers:**
- **Ise/Hyuga:** 22 aircraft, no catapult, crane recovery
- **Shokaku-class carrier:** 84 aircraft, catapults, full flight deck
- **Cost:** Conversion cost nearly equal to building real carrier
- **Result:** Hybrid carriers provided minimal aviation capability at high cost

**Legacy:** Unique experiment in hybrid battleship-carrier design. Demonstrated desperation of IJN after Midway carrier losses. Conversion proved impractical - neither effective battleship nor carrier. Successfully used as decoy at Cape Engaño - survived when all four carriers sunk. Only capital ships to survive battle. Showed futility of half-measures - Japan needed real carriers, not hybrids. Wrecks remain in Kure Harbor (raised post-war, scrapped). Concept never repeated by any navy - proved battleship-carrier hybrids were dead end.

**Historical Significance:** Ise-class conversion represented Japan's desperate attempt to rapidly increase carrier capacity. Midway losses (4 carriers) crippled IJN carrier force. Rather than wait years for new carriers, IJN converted battleships. Showed flawed strategic thinking - expense and time nearly equal to building proper carriers. Cape Engaño survival showed they were tough battleships, but useless as carriers. Epitomized Japan's late-war improvisation and declining fortunes. Name "Ise" from ancient Japanese province, "Hyuga" from Kyushu region.
