**Key Specs:** 15,140/15,428 tons | 432ft | 18 kn | 4× 12-inch + 14× 6-inch | 1 ship | **PRESERVED**

**Innovation:** **Peak pre-dreadnought design** (1902) - best technology before HMS Dreadnought revolution. Built by **Vickers** (Barrow-in-Furness, UK) - top British yard. Improvements over Fuji/Shikishima: Krupp cemented armor (superior to Harvey - face-hardened steel, German patent), better secondary battery layout (14× 6-inch vs Fuji's 10), improved fire control positions, longer range (9,000 nm vs 4,000 nm). Four 12-inch guns (40-caliber) in twin turrets (fore/aft). 14× 6-inch 45-caliber in casemates (rapid-fire, torpedo boat defense). Heavy AA battery (20× 12-pounder). Four submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Moderate armor (9-inch belt - lighter than Fuji's 18-inch, but Krupp superior). 25 Belleville boilers (French design, efficient). Two triple-expansion engines (15,000 ihp). 18 knots (standard for pre-dreadnoughts). Crew 830 (large - complex systems, manual operations). **Chosen as fleet flagship** (most modern, best equipped). Flagship facilities: Flag bridge, admiral's quarters, signal equipment, communications. Admiral Heihachiro Togo's flagship (1904-1905).

**Design:** Large pre-dreadnought battleship hull (432 ft, 15,428 tons full). **Four 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber guns**: Two twin turrets (forward turret elevated above forward superstructure, aft turret on quarterdeck). Hydraulic training/elevation. Slow-firing (~1-2 rounds/minute). **14× 6-inch (152mm) 45-caliber secondary guns**: Casemate mounts along hull sides (main deck, upper deck). Rapid-fire (5-6 rounds/minute). Torpedo boat defense. 20× 12-pounder (76mm) quick-firing guns (close-range defense). 8× 3-pounder (47mm) guns. Four 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes (bow, stern, broadside). **Krupp cemented armor**: 9-inch main belt (waterline, amidships), 3-inch deck (splinter protection), 10-inch turret faces, 14-inch conning tower. Lighter than earlier Japanese BBs but better quality. Two military masts (fighting tops, observation platforms). Two tall funnels (25 Belleville boilers). Distinctive profile: High freeboard, pronounced ram bow (obsolete but traditional), elegant lines. White/gray peacetime livery. **Flagship features**: Flag bridge above main bridge, admiral's day cabin, signals staff spaces, additional communications.

**Battle of Tsushima - Greatest Naval Victory:**

**Background:**
- **Russo-Japanese War** (1904-1905): Japan vs Russia over Manchuria/Korea
- Russian Pacific Fleet destroyed/blockaded at Port Arthur (1904)
- Russia sent Baltic Fleet (renamed 2nd Pacific Squadron) - 7-month voyage around world
- 38 Russian ships (8 battleships) vs 89 Japanese ships (4 battleships, 8 armored cruisers)
- **Admiral Heihachiro Togo**: Japanese commander, flying flag on Mikasa

**May 27, 1905 - The Battle:**

**0500-1300 Hours (Morning):**
- Russian fleet sighted in Tsushima Strait (between Korea and Japan)
- Weather: Clear, calm seas (excellent gunnery conditions)
- Togo's fleet steamed to intercept
- **Mikasa leads line**: 12 Japanese capital ships in line ahead (Mikasa → Shikishima → Fuji → Asahi → armored cruisers)

**1355 Hours - "T" Crossing Maneuver:**
- **Famous signal**: Togo raised flags on Mikasa - **"The Empire's fate depends on the result of this battle, let every man do his utmost duty"** (Z flag signal)
- Similar to Nelson's "England expects..." at Trafalgar (1805)
- Togo's maneuver: Turned line 180° in succession (risky - exposed each ship to Russian fire during turn)
- **Goal**: Cross Russian "T" (all Japanese guns bear vs only Russian forward guns)
- Mikasa led turn (under fire, shells falling around)
- Turn completed successfully

**1405-1530 Hours - Main Engagement:**
- Range: 6,400 yards (close for 1905)
- **Mikasa opened fire** at 1405 (first salvo from forward turret)
- Japanese battleships concentrated fire on Russian flagship Knyaz Suvorov
- **Superior Japanese gunnery**:
  - Faster rate of fire (trained crews, practiced)
  - Better range estimation
  - Shimose explosive shells (devastating against lightly-armored superstructures)
- Russian return fire less effective (crews exhausted from 7-month voyage, poor training)
- **Mikasa hit multiple times**:
  - 12-inch shell hit conning tower (splinter damage, no penetration)
  - 6-inch shell hit hull (minor damage)
  - Several smaller hits
  - **Total: ~40 hits** (most small-caliber, minimal damage)
- Russian flagship Knyaz Suvorov crippled (steering disabled, fires raging)
- Russian line broke formation (chaos)

**1530-1900 Hours - Pursuit:**
- Russian fleet scattered
- Japanese armored cruisers (faster) pursued
- Destroyers/torpedo boats attacked (night torpedo attacks)
- Mikasa continued firing as targets presented

**May 28, 1905 - Annihilation:**
- Russian survivors attempted to reach Vladivostok
- Japanese forces hunted down stragglers
- Most Russian ships sunk or surrendered

**Results:**
- **Russian losses**: 21 ships sunk, 7 captured (including 8 battleships) = 28 of 38 ships lost!
- **Japanese losses**: 3 torpedo boats sunk
- **Most decisive naval victory in history** (more one-sided than Trafalgar)
- Russia sued for peace (Treaty of Portsmouth, September 1905)
- **Mikasa's role**: Flagship, led line, absorbed enemy fire, demonstrated excellent armor
- **Admiral Togo**: National hero, "Nelson of the East"

**Mikasa's Damage:**
- ~40 hits total (12-inch, 6-inch, smaller calibers)
- Krupp armor held (no major penetrations)
- Superficial damage to superstructure
- Casualties: 113 wounded, 6 killed (remarkably light!)
- Repaired within weeks (back to full operational status)

**Post-Tsushima - Tragedy and Resurrection:**

**September 11, 1905 - Disaster:**
- **Location**: Sasebo Naval Base (Japan)
- **Time**: 0240 (night)
- **Mikasa moored at buoy** (post-Tsushima celebrations ongoing)
- **Explosion**: Massive magazine detonation
  - Aft magazine (6-inch shells) exploded
  - Blast destroyed stern, started fires
  - Forward magazine flooded (prevented total destruction)
- **Sinking**: Mikasa settled to bottom in 15 meters of water
  - Superstructure above water
  - Heavy list to port
- **Casualties**: 339 killed, ~300 wounded
- **Cause**: Never definitively determined
  - Official: Accidental (electrical fault, spontaneous combustion)
  - Suspected: Sabotage (disgruntled sailor, possible Russian agent)
  - Mystery remains

**October 1905-August 1906 - Salvage:**
- Massive salvage operation (Japanese Navy + private companies)
- Pumped water from hull
- Patched holes
- Refloated August 8, 1906
- Towed to Yokosuka for repairs

**1906-1908 - Reconstruction:**
- Drydocked at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- Stern completely rebuilt
- New magazine safety systems installed
- Equipment replaced
- Cost: Nearly as much as building new ship
- **Why worth it**: National symbol (Tsushima flagship), morale importance

**1908-1923 - Second Career:**
- Recommissioned 1908 (6 years after sinking!)
- Coast defense ship (obsolete by dreadnought era)
- Training duties
- WWI: Patrol operations (minimal action)

**Legacy:** Mikasa was Japan's most famous battleship. Commissioned 1902 (British-built, peak pre-dreadnought). Admiral Togo's flagship at Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905) - most decisive naval victory in history (28 of 38 Russian ships lost). Led line of battle, absorbed ~40 hits, minimal damage (Krupp armor held). Togo's "Z flag" signal ("Empire's fate...") famous. Sank at moorings September 1905 (magazine explosion, 339 killed) - raised, repaired, served until 1923. Preserved as museum ship in Yokosuka since 1926. **ONLY surviving pre-dreadnought battleship worldwide!** National Historic Site. Symbol of Japanese naval heritage, Tsushima victory, Togo's leadership. Visited by 300,000+ annually. Mikasa: Legendary flagship, living history, national treasure.

**Historical Significance:** Mikasa symbolizes Japan's rise to great power status. Commissioned 1902 - Japan opened to West 1854 (48 years earlier!), now operating world-class battleship. British-built (Vickers - technology transfer), but increasingly Japanese-operated/modified. Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905): **Most decisive naval battle in modern history.** Japanese 4 battleships + 8 armored cruisers vs Russian 8 battleships + 3 armored cruisers. Result: 21 Russian ships sunk, 7 captured (28 of 38 = 74% lost!) vs 3 Japanese torpedo boats lost. More one-sided than Trafalgar (1805). First modern fleet battle (mines, torpedoes, wireless, long-range gunnery). First time Asian power defeated European power (shocked Western world). Treaty of Portsmouth (September 1905): Japan gained Korea, southern Sakhalin, Port Arthur. Japan recognized as major power (invited to colonial conferences, alliances). Admiral Togo = "Nelson of the East" (international fame). Mikasa = symbol of victory. 1905 sinking (magazine explosion) + salvage = national determination (spent fortune to raise, repair). Preserved 1926 (unique - all other pre-dreadnoughts scrapped). WWII: Stripped, neglected. 1950s-1960s: Restored (US Navy helped - respect for historic ship). Present: Museum ship, National Historic Site, **only surviving pre-dreadnought battleship.** Parallels: HMS Victory (Nelson's Trafalgar flagship, preserved Portsmouth), USS Constitution (War of 1812, preserved Boston). Mikasa: Japan's naval equivalent, symbol of maritime heritage and greatest victory.
