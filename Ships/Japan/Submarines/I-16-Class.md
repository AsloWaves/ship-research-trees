**Pearl Harbor Midget Carriers** - I-16-class were Japanese submarines carrying midget submarines. 5 boats commissioned 1940-1941. Large (2,184/3,561 tons), carried one Ko-hyoteki midget submarine on deck. Pearl Harbor attack (December 7, 1941) - all five launched midgets into harbor. Eight torpedo tubes + 20 torpedoes. 23.6 knots surfaced. All five lost 1942-1945 (100% loss rate). I-24's midget captured - Ensign Sakamaki became first Japanese POW of WWII. Showed midget submarine concept - mother sub carries mini-sub for harbor penetration.

**Key Specs:** 2,184/3,561 tons | 346ft | 23.6/8 kn | 8× 533mm tubes (20 torpedoes) + 1 Ko-hyoteki midget sub | 14,000 nm range | 5 boats

**Innovation:** Type C cruiser submarines modified to carry Ko-hyoteki midget submarines. Large hangar on aft deck housed two-man mini-sub. Mother submarine transported midget to target, launched for attack, recovered after (theoretically). Eight torpedo tubes, twenty torpedoes (mother sub). 23.6 knots surfaced (fast). All five participated Pearl Harbor attack (December 7, 1941) - launched midgets for harbor penetration. All five midgets lost/captured, none recovered. All five mother subs lost 1942-1945. I-24's midget captured with Ensign Sakamaki (first Japanese POW). Midget submarine concept showed Japanese innovative thinking but limited success. 100% loss rate for mother subs.

**Design:** Large fleet submarine hull (346 ft, 2,184 tons surfaced). Eight torpedo tubes (six bow, two stern). Twenty Type 95 torpedoes carried. 140mm deck gun. Two 25mm AA guns. **Ko-hyoteki midget submarine:** Cylindrical hangar on aft deck, waterproof, containing two-man mini-sub. Launch system: Flood hangar, open doors, mini-sub floats out. Recovery (theoretical): Reverse process. Diesel-electric propulsion. Two shafts. 23.6 knots surfaced (very fast for large submarine). Long range (14,000 nm). Crew 97 (plus 2 midget sub crew). Standard Type C layout with midget modification.

**Boats (5 built - all lost):**

**All lost in combat:**
1. **I-16** - Sunk May 19, 1944 (destroyer escorts, off Solomons), all hands lost
2. **I-18** - Sunk February 11, 1943 (submarine USS Guardfish, off Guadalcanal), all hands lost
3. **I-20** - Sunk September 8, 1943 (probably mine, near Rabaul), all hands lost
4. **I-22** - Sunk October 7, 1942 (submarine USS Growler, off Truk), all hands lost
5. **I-24** - Sunk June 29, 1943 (destroyer USS Frazier, off Admiralty Islands), all hands lost

**Construction:**
- Builders: Kure, Yokosuka Naval Arsenals
- Commissioned: 1940-1941
- Type C1 cruiser submarines modified for midget carrying

**Pearl Harbor Attack (December 7, 1941):**

**All Five I-16-Class Participated:**

**Mission:**
- Transport Ko-hyoteki midget submarines to Pearl Harbor
- Launch midgets at harbor entrance night before main attack
- Midgets penetrate harbor
- Attack battleships with torpedoes
- Recover midgets after attack (if possible)
- Mother submarines escape

**December 6-7, 1941:**

**Each submarine:**
- Approached Oahu surfaced at night
- Positioned off Pearl Harbor entrance
- **Launched Ko-hyoteki midget submarine** (5 midgets total)
- Midgets attempted harbor penetration

**Midget Results:**
- **All 5 midgets lost/captured:**
  - Some sunk entering harbor
  - Some depth charged inside harbor
  - One (from I-24) grounded, crew captured
  - Zero torpedoes hit targets
  - Mission failed tactically

**Mother Submarine Results:**
- All 5 escaped Pearl Harbor area
- Continued war patrols
- **But: All 5 eventually lost 1942-1944**

**I-24's Midget - First Japanese POW:**

**Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki's Story:**

**December 7, 1941:**
- I-24 launched midget sub with Ensign Sakamaki (commander) and Petty Officer Inagaki
- Midget encountered problems entering harbor
- Navigation equipment failed
- **Grounded on reef** near Bellows Field
- Sakamaki attempted to destroy sub, failed
- **Captured by US forces** (first Japanese POW of WWII)
- Inagaki drowned

**Significance:**
- First Japanese prisoner of war
- Intense shame (Japanese military culture)
- Questioned by US intelligence
- Kept in POW camps until 1945
- **Survived war** (returned to Japan)
- Later wrote memoir about experience

**Service History (Mother Submarines):**

**I-16 (1940-1944):**
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941)
- **May 19, 1944:** Detected by US destroyer escorts off Solomons
- Depth charged
- **Sunk with all hands** (97 killed)

**I-18 (1941-1943):**
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941)
- Multiple war patrols
- **February 11, 1943:** Engaged USS Guardfish (SS-217) off Guadalcanal
- Torpedoed
- **Sunk with all hands** (97 killed)

**I-20 (1940-1943):**
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941)
- Guadalcanal operations
- **September 8, 1943:** Probably hit mine near Rabaul
- **Lost with all hands** (97 killed)
- Exact circumstances unclear

**I-22 (1940-1942):**
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941)
- **October 7, 1942:** Engaged USS Growler (SS-215) off Truk
- Surface gun battle
- USS Growler rammed I-22
- **I-22 sunk** (all hands lost, 97 killed)
- Shortest service of class

**I-24 (1941-1943):**
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941) - midget captured
- Continued patrols despite midget loss
- **June 29, 1943:** Detected by USS Frazier (DD-607)
- Depth charged
- **Sunk with all hands** (97 killed)

**Ko-hyoteki Midget Submarines:**

**Specifications:**
- Length: 78 ft
- Displacement: 46 tons submerged
- Crew: 2 (commander, petty officer)
- Speed: 23 knots surfaced, 19 knots submerged (electric only)
- Armament: 2× 18-inch torpedoes
- Range: 100 nm at 6 knots
- Battery-powered only (no diesel)

**Concept:**
- Mother submarine carries to target
- Launch near enemy harbor
- Penetrate defenses while submerged
- Attack with torpedoes
- Escape and rendezvous for recovery
- Suicide mission if recovery impossible

**Pearl Harbor Midgets:**
- **5 launched, 5 lost:**
  - 4 sunk in combat
  - 1 captured (I-24's midget)
- **9 crew killed, 1 captured** (10 total midget crew)
- **Zero successful attacks**
- Mission failure

**Why 100% Loss Rate (Mother Subs):**

**Factors:**
1. **Aggressive employment:** Frontline service constantly
2. **Pearl Harbor veterans:** All five high-value targets (revenge factor)
3. **Large size:** 2,184 tons - easier to detect than smaller subs
4. **1942-1944:** Period of heaviest submarine losses
5. **Allied ASW:** Improving rapidly
6. **No luck:** All five found and sunk

**Loss Timeline:**
- October 1942: I-22 (10 months after Pearl Harbor)
- February 1943: I-18 (14 months)
- June 1943: I-24 (18 months)
- September 1943: I-20 (21 months)
- May 1944: I-16 (29 months)

**Midget Submarine Concept - Evaluation:**

**Theory:**
- Small submarine penetrates harbor defenses
- Attacks capital ships at anchor
- Difficult to detect (small)
- Minimal crew risk (2 vs 97)

**Reality:**
- Pearl Harbor: 5 launched, 0 hits, 5 lost
- Limited range (100 nm)
- Battery only (no diesel = no recharge)
- Two torpedoes (limited ammunition)
- No successful recoveries (all one-way missions)
- Became kamikaze weapons later (Kaiten)

**Comparison - Midget Submarine Carriers:**
| Class | Nation | Built | Midgets | Pearl Harbor | Lost |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|--------------|------|
| **I-16** | **Japan** | **5** | **Ko-hyoteki** | **All 5 participated** | **5/5** |
| Type IXD2 | Germany | Few | Biber/Seehund | Not used | Most lost |
| X-craft | UK | ~20 | X-class | Tirpitz attack | Some lost |

**I-16: Pearl Harbor participation unique**

**Legacy:** I-16-class represented Japanese midget submarine carrier concept. Five large submarines (2,184 tons) each carrying one Ko-hyoteki midget sub. All five participated Pearl Harbor attack (December 7, 1941) - launched midgets for harbor penetration. All five midgets lost, zero hits achieved. I-24's midget captured - Ensign Sakamaki first Japanese POW. All five mother submarines lost 1942-1944 (100% loss rate). Midget submarine concept showed innovation but limited success. Later evolved into Kaiten suicide torpedoes (manned torpedoes). Names: I-16, I-18, I-20, I-22, I-24 (number designations).

**Historical Significance:** I-16-class epitomized Pearl Harbor attack's unconventional aspects. Five submarines carrying midget subs - innovative but failed tactically. Midgets: 5 launched, 0 hits, 5 lost (100% loss). I-24's midget captured with Sakamaki - first Japanese POW, intense shame in Japanese culture, survived war. Mother subs: All 5 lost 1942-1944 showing IJN submarine attrition. Midget concept evolved from harbor penetration (Pearl Harbor failure) to suicide weapons (Kaiten manned torpedoes, 1944-1945). Shows Japanese tactical innovation (midget subs) vs strategic failure (all lost, no impact). Pearl Harbor remembered for carrier air attack, but 5 midget subs also tried - forgotten failure overshadowed by carrier success. I-16-class: Innovative concept, poor execution, 100% attrition.
