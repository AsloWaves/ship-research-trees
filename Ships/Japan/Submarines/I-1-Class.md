**First Fleet Submarines** - I-1-Class were Japan's first large fleet submarines. 4 boats commissioned 1926-1929. Kaidai Type I (first of series). Large (1,635 tons surface), diesel-electric, 17.5 knots surface. Six 21-inch torpedo tubes, 14 torpedoes carried. 10,000 nm range (trans-Pacific capability). One 4.7-inch deck gun. All 4 served WWII (1941-1945). All 4 lost (100% loss rate). I-1 sank USS Edsall DD-219 (March 1942). Founded Japanese fleet submarine tradition - trans-Pacific range, fleet speed, heavy torpedo armament. Evolved into later Kaidai types and specialized submarines.

**Key Specs:** 1,635/2,135 tons | 320ft | 17.5/8 kn | 6× 533mm torpedo tubes | 14 torpedoes | 1× 120mm + 1× 76mm | 245ft test depth | 10,000 nm range | 4 boats

**Innovation:** Japan's first purpose-designed fleet submarines (1926-1929). Kaidai Type I - beginning of standardized fleet boat series. Large size (1,635 tons surface - 29× larger than No. 1-Class from 1905!). Diesel-electric propulsion (reliable, efficient). 17.5 knots surface (could keep up with battlefleet). 8 knots submerged (adequate). 10,000 nm range at 10 knots (trans-Pacific operations - Hawaii, West Coast possible). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern). 14 torpedoes total. One 4.7-inch deck gun (commerce raiding, surface combat). 245-foot test depth. Crew 70. All 4 served WWII. All 4 lost 1943-1945 (I-1 and I-2 December 1943, I-3 December 1942, I-4 December 1942 - 100% loss). Proved concept but vulnerable to ASW. Founded Japanese fleet submarine doctrine.

**Design:** Large fleet submarine hull (320 ft, 1,635 tons surface). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes - 4 in bow (salvo capability), 2 in stern (escape shots). 14 torpedoes carried total (generous reload capacity). One 4.7-inch deck gun forward (surface attacks on merchants). One 3-inch AA gun aft. Two 7.7mm machine guns. Diesel-electric propulsion: Two diesel engines surface (4,700 shp total), electric motors submerged (1,800 shp). Two shafts. 17.5 knots surface, 8 knots submerged. 10,000 nm range surface at economical speed (trans-Pacific). 245-foot test depth (adequate for era). Crew 70. Designed for fleet operations - scout for battlefleet, attack enemy capital ships, trans-Pacific range, fleet speed.

**USS Edsall Sinking (March 1, 1942):**

**Background:**
- USS Edsall DD-219 (Clemson-class destroyer)
- Fleeing Java after Japanese invasion
- Alone, trying to reach Australia

**Attack:**
- Spotted by Japanese battleships Hiei and Kirishima
- I-1 and I-2 positioned nearby
- Japanese cruisers joined attack
- Edsall maneuvered violently (avoided 1,400+ shells!)
- Finally damaged by battleship hits
- Aircraft from carrier Soryu finished her off
- **All 153 crew killed** (went down fighting)
- I-1 and I-2 participated in pursuit

**Significance:**
- Showed Japanese overwhelming force vs isolated ships
- Edsall's brave fight remembered
- I-1-Class combat effectiveness proven

**Why 100% Loss:**

**All 4 Sunk:**
- I-3: December 9, 1942 (17 months of war)
- I-4: December 21, 1942 (17 months of war)
- I-1: January 29, 1943 (19 months of war)
- I-2: April 7, 1944 (28 months of war)

**Reasons:**
1. **Age:** 13-18 years old when war started (older submarines)
2. **ASW improvement:** Allies developed better anti-submarine warfare
3. **Radar:** Allied radar detected surfaced submarines
4. **Air patrols:** Constant air coverage in Pacific
5. **Depth charges:** Improved depth charge tactics
6. **Vulnerable:** Large submarines, less maneuverable
7. **Aggressive use:** Japan used submarines offensively (riskier)

**Kaidai Type Series:**

**Standardization:**
- Kaidai = "Large Type" (fleet submarine)
- I-1-Class: Kaidai Type I (first)
- Later: Types II, III, IV, V, VI, VIIa, VIIb (incremental improvements)
- Similar design philosophy: Large, long-range, fleet boats

**I-1-Class Foundation:**
- Established design principles
- 1,600-2,000 ton displacement
- 17-20 knots surface
- 8-9 knots submerged
- 10,000+ nm range
- 6-8 torpedo tubes
- 14-20 torpedoes
- Deck gun(s)

**Later Kaidai boats refined concept but followed I-1 template**

**Comparison - Japanese Fleet Submarines:**
| Class | Type | Year | Tons | Speed (surf/sub) | Torpedoes | Range | Fate |
|-------|------|------|------|------------------|-----------|-------|------|
| **I-1** | **Kaidai I** | **1926-29** | **1,635** | **17.5/8 kn** | **14** | **10,000 nm** | **All sunk** |
| I-5 | Kaidai II | 1932 | 1,750 | 18/8 kn | 16 | 10,000 nm | All sunk |
| I-121 | Kaidai III | 1927 | 1,400 | 17/7.5 kn | 12 | 10,000 nm | All sunk |
| I-54 | Kaidai VI | 1943-44 | 1,780 | 17.7/6.5 kn | 19 | 13,000 nm | Most sunk |

**I-1-Class: Foundation design for Japanese fleet submarine concept**

**Deck Gun - 4.7-inch:**

**Purpose:**
- Surface attacks on unarmed merchants (save torpedoes)
- Warning shots (stop ship for inspection)
- Finish off damaged ships
- Anti-aircraft (limited)

**Effectiveness:**
- Worked well 1942 (few Allied escorts)
- Dangerous by 1943 (air patrols, radar)
- Submarines vulnerable on surface
- Limited use in practice

**I-1-Class Use:**
- Early war: Some merchant attacks
- Later war: Too dangerous to surface
- Removed or rarely used by 1944

**10,000 nm Range:**

**Trans-Pacific Capability:**
- Tokyo to Hawaii: 3,850 nm
- Tokyo to West Coast USA: 5,000 nm
- **I-1-Class range: 10,000 nm**
- Could operate anywhere in Pacific

**Strategic Implications:**
- Attack US West Coast
- Hawaii operations
- Indian Ocean raids
- South Pacific campaigns
- Australia approaches
- No need for forward bases (self-sufficient)

**Limitations:**
- Range calculated at economical 10 knots
- Higher speeds reduced range drastically
- Still needed resupply for extended patrols

**Legacy:** I-1-Class founded Japanese fleet submarine tradition. 4 boats (1926-1929) - first large, long-range fleet submarines. Kaidai Type I established design philosophy: 1,600+ tons, 17+ knots, 10,000 nm range, trans-Pacific capability, heavy torpedo armament. All 4 served WWII from Pearl Harbor (December 1941) through 1944. All 4 lost to Allied ASW (100% loss - I-3 and I-4 December 1942, I-1 January 1943, I-2 April 1944). I-1 and I-2 sank USS Edsall DD-219 (March 1942). Proved fleet submarine concept but vulnerable to improved Allied ASW (radar, air patrols, depth charges). Design influenced all later Japanese fleet submarines (I-5, I-121, I-54, etc.). Evolution: No. 1 (1905, 57 tons, experimental) → I-1 (1926, 1,635 tons, fleet submarine) → I-400 (1944, 5,223 tons, largest). I-1-Class: Critical intermediate step.

**Historical Significance:** I-1-Class represented Japan's transition to modern fleet submarines. Commissioned 1926-1929 during interwar period when major powers developing submarine doctrines. Japanese chose fleet submarine concept: Large boats, long range (10,000 nm trans-Pacific), fleet speed (17.5 knots), scouting role, attack enemy capital ships. Different from German U-boats (commerce raiding, wolf packs) or American fleet boats (offensive patrols). I-1-Class established Kaidai series philosophy - standardized fleet boats with incremental improvements through 1930s-1940s. All 4 fought WWII from first day (Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941) to 1944. All 4 lost to Allied ASW - showed vulnerability of large submarines vs radar, air patrols, depth charges. Evolution visible: I-1 (1926, 1,635 tons, first fleet boat) → I-400 (1944, 5,223 tons, aircraft-carrying monster) = same philosophy, bigger execution. I-1-Class: Foundation stones. Without them, Japan couldn't have developed advanced submarine force. Learned lessons (positive and negative) guided all future designs.
