**Cruiser Submarines** - I-15-class (Type B1) were most numerous IJN submarine class. 20 boats built 1940-1944. Large fleet submarines (2,584/3,654 tons) with one floatplane for reconnaissance. Six torpedo tubes forward, 5.5-inch deck gun. Long range (14,000 nm). All but one lost 1942-1945. I-19 sank USS Wasp (carrier) and USS O'Brien (destroyer) with single torpedo salvo - most destructive submarine attack in history.

**Key Specs:** 2,584/3,654 tons | 356ft | 23.6/8 kn | 6× 533mm torpedo tubes + 17 torpedoes + 1× 140mm deck gun + 1 floatplane | 20 boats

**Innovation:** Type B "cruiser submarine" concept - large, long-range, aircraft-carrying. Most numerous IJN submarine class (20 built). Floatplane (Yokosuka E14Y1 "Glen") for reconnaissance over vast Pacific. 140mm deck gun for surface combat. Excellent range (14,000 nm) for extended patrols. Operated as fleet scouts and commerce raiders. I-19's single salvo sank carrier and destroyer - unique achievement. I-25 bombarded Oregon coast - only Axis attack on US mainland.

**Design:** Large fleet submarine. Six 21-inch torpedo tubes forward (bow). Hangar aft of conning tower for one floatplane. 140mm deck gun forward. High surface speed (23.6 knots) for fleet operations. Good submerged speed (8 knots). Two diesels for surface, electric motors submerged. Catapult for aircraft launch. Crane to recover floatplane. 17 torpedoes carried total. Designed for long-range offensive patrols.

**Result:**
- **Single 6-torpedo salvo:**
  - Sank 1 aircraft carrier (USS Wasp)
  - Sank 1 destroyer (USS O'Brien - sank October 19 from damage)
  - Damaged 1 battleship (USS North Carolina)
- **Most destructive submarine attack in history**
- I-19 escaped undamaged

**I-25 - Oregon Bombardment:**

**Loss Statistics:**
- **20 built, 19-20 lost (some unconfirmed)**
- **Causes:**
  - Depth charges: ~10 boats
  - Submarine attacks: ~3 boats
  - Ramming: 1 boat (I-17)
  - Mines: 1 boat (I-30)
  - Aircraft: Several
  - Unconfirmed: 3-4 boats
- **Survival rate:** 0-5% (possibly 1 survivor if any)
- **Loss period:** 1942-1945

**Comparison - WWII Fleet Submarines:**
| Class | Nation | Number | Displacement | Range | Aircraft | Deck Gun |
|-------|--------|--------|--------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **I-15 (B1)** | **Japan** | **20** | **2,584/3,654** | **14,000 nm** | **1** | **140mm** |
| Gato | USA | 77 | 1,525/2,424 | 11,000 nm | 0 | 127mm |
| Type IXC | Germany | 54 | 1,120/1,232 | 13,450 nm | 0 | 105mm |

**Tactical Limitations:**
- **Large size:** Easy to detect
- **Slow submerged:** 8 knots inadequate to escape escorts
- **Long dive time:** Large size = slow crash dive
- **Deck gun obsolete:** Vulnerable to air attack when surfaced
- **Aircraft maintenance:** Complex, time-consuming
- **Mission confusion:** Fleet scouting vs commerce raiding

**Why Heavy Losses:**
1. **US anti-submarine warfare:**
   - Improved depth charges
   - Better sonar
   - Radar-equipped aircraft
   - Hunter-killer groups
2. **Doctrine flaws:** Fleet support instead of commerce raiding
3. **Large size:** Easier targets
4. **Slow submerged:** Couldn't escape escorts
5. **Predictable:** Tended to surface to use deck gun or aircraft

**Legacy:** I-15-class represented IJN cruiser submarine doctrine - large, long-range, aircraft-carrying boats for fleet support. Most numerous class (20 boats) but nearly 100% losses. I-19's single salvo (carrier + destroyer sunk, battleship damaged) was most destructive submarine attack ever. I-25 achieved only Axis attacks on US mainland (bombs and shells). Heavy losses showed doctrine flawed - fleet support role negated submarine stealth advantages. US submarines focused on commerce raiding and were far more successful. Type B concept impressive but tactically ineffective. Names: I-series numbered system.

**Historical Significance:** I-15-class epitomized strengths and fatal flaws of IJN submarine doctrine. Large, capable boats with excellent range and reconnaissance aircraft. But fleet support mission meant operating in defended areas against escorts and aircraft. Nearly 100% loss rate demonstrated failure of doctrine. I-19's Wasp sinking showed potential - but most boats achieved little before being sunk. I-25's Oregon attacks had more psychological than military value. US learned opposite lesson - focused submarines on merchant shipping with devastating success. I-29's loss with German technology aboard symbolized failed Axis cooperation. Type B cruiser submarines impressive on paper but wrong doctrine for submarine warfare.
