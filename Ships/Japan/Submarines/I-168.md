**Yorktown's Killer** - I-168 was an experimental fleet submarine. 1 boat commissioned 1934. Six torpedo tubes, 14 torpedoes. Famous for sinking damaged USS Yorktown after Battle of Midway (June 1942). Penetrated destroyer screen, torpedoed Yorktown under tow, finished off carrier and escort destroyer USS Hammann. One of most successful single submarine attacks. Sunk July 1943 by Allied ASW forces.

**Key Specs:** 1,400/2,200 tons | 329ft | 20/8 kn | 6× 533mm tubes (14 torpedoes) + 100mm gun | 1 boat

**Innovation:** Experimental KD6b-type submarine. Refined earlier KD-series designs. Good range (10,000 nm), adequate speed (20 knots surfaced). Six bow torpedo tubes. Achieved fame sinking USS Yorktown (CV-5) at Midway - penetrated destroyer escort screen, torpedoed both carrier and destroyer USS Hammann. One of most successful submarine attacks of WWII - finished off fleet carrier already damaged. Showed aggressive Japanese submarine tactics at their best. Lost July 1943 to Allied ASW.

**Design:** Experimental refinement of KD (Kaidai) series. Six bow torpedo tubes. 14 torpedoes carried. 100mm deck gun. Diesel-electric propulsion. Good surface speed (20 knots). Slow submerged (8 knots - standard for era). Long range (10,000 nm) for extended patrols. Double-hull construction. Dive depth ~250 feet. Good habitability for crew of 60. Proved successful design but only one built (experimental).

**Boat:**
- **I-168** - Sunk July 27, 1943 (depth charges from ASW forces, near New Hebrides), all hands lost

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** November 1932
- **Launched:** June 30, 1933
- **Commissioned:** July 31, 1934

**Service History:**

**Pre-War (1934-1941):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- China operations
- Patrol duties
- 7 years peacetime service

**WWII (1941-1943):**

**December 1941 - Pearl Harbor:**
- Part of submarine force
- Patrolled near Hawaiian Islands
- No confirmed sinkings

**April-May 1942 - Indian Ocean:**
- Patrols off Ceylon (Sri Lanka)
- Japanese carrier raids on Ceylon
- I-168 on patrol
- No confirmed sinkings

**June 1942 - Battle of Midway:**
*Yorktown's Fate*

**Background:**
- **Battle of Midway (June 4-5, 1942)**
- Four Japanese carriers sunk
- USS Yorktown damaged by dive bombers and torpedo
- Dead in water but salvageable
- US destroyer Hammann alongside providing power
- Tow begun toward Pearl Harbor
- Destroyer screen around Yorktown

**June 6, 1942 - I-168's Mission:**
**Morning:**
- I-168 ordered to find and sink Yorktown
- Located by scouting
- Yorktown under tow, limping toward Pearl
- 5-6 destroyers screening

**Afternoon - Approach:**
- I-168 commenced attack run
- **Penetrated destroyer screen submerged**
- Difficult approach - multiple escorts
- Commander Tanabe expertly maneuvered
- Got within 600 yards of Yorktown

**4:30 PM - Attack:**
- Fired spread of 4 torpedoes
- **Two torpedoes hit USS Yorktown** (port side)
- **One torpedo hit USS Hammann** (destroyer alongside)
- **Hammann broke in half, sank in 4 minutes**
- **80 killed on Hammann**
- Yorktown severely damaged again

**Escape:**
- Destroyers counterattacked with depth charges
- I-168 went deep
- Over 60 depth charges dropped
- I-168 survived (good construction, skillful crew)
- Escaped destroyer screen
- Returned to base

**USS Yorktown's Fate:**
- Two new torpedo hits catastrophic
- Flooding uncontrollable
- **June 7, 1942 (dawn): Yorktown capsized and sank**
- Lost ~140 crew total (from all attacks)

**Result:**
- **I-168 finished off fleet carrier USS Yorktown**
- **Sank escort destroyer USS Hammann**
- One of most successful submarine attacks in WWII
- Strategic impact: One less carrier for US Navy

**1942-1943: Continued Patrols:**
- Solomons operations
- Convoy attacks
- Few successes
- Allied ASW improving

**July 27, 1943 - Sinking:**
*Near New Hebrides*

**Background:**
- Patrol near New Hebrides
- Allied ASW forces searching
- I-168 detected

**Attack:**
- **Depth charged by Allied ASW forces** (aircraft and escorts)
- Multiple depth charge runs
- Sustained damage
- Unable to escape
- Forced deeper
- Flooding began

**Loss:**
- **Sank with all hands** (60 crew)
- No survivors
- Exact location uncertain

**Yorktown Attack Analysis:**

**Why So Successful:**
1. **Skillful commander:** Lt. Cmdr. Tanabe
2. **Persistent approach:** Penetrated destroyer screen
3. **Calm execution:** 600-yard range perfect
4. **Target vulnerable:** Yorktown dead in water
5. **Luck:** Escaped 60+ depth charges

**Impact:**
- USS Yorktown lost (fleet carrier)
- USS Hammann lost (destroyer)
- **Combined US losses:** ~220 dead
- One submarine inflicted strategic damage

**Strategic Significance:**
- Yorktown veteran of Coral Sea, Midway
- Loss reduced US carrier strength temporarily
- But: US carrier production accelerating
- Japan couldn't replace Midway losses (4 carriers)

**Comparison - Successful Submarine Attacks:**
| Submarine | Target | Date | Result |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|
| **I-168** | **USS Yorktown + USS Hammann** | **Jun 1942** | **Carrier + destroyer sunk** |
| I-19 | USS Wasp + USS O'Brien + USS North Carolina | Sep 1942 | Carrier + destroyer sunk, battleship damaged |
| USS Archerfish | Shinano | Nov 1944 | Largest carrier ever sunk |
| HMS Conqueror | General Belgrano | Apr 1982 | Cruiser sunk (Falklands) |

**I-168's attack among most successful** - finished off fleet carrier

**Commander Tanabe:**
- **Lieutenant Commander Yahachi Tanabe**
- Skilled submariner
- Aggressive but careful
- Yorktown attack his greatest success
- Escaped 60 depth charges through skill
- Lost with I-168 (July 1943)

**USS Yorktown (CV-5) - The Victim:**
**History:**
- Commissioned 1937
- Coral Sea (May 1942): Damaged
- Hastily repaired for Midway (3 days!)
- Midway (June 4): Dive bomber hits, torpedo hits
- Dead in water but salvageable
- **June 6: I-168 torpedoes finished her**
- **June 7: Capsized and sank**

**Legacy:**
- Yorktown-class lead ship
- Veteran of 2 carrier battles
- Helped sink 4 Japanese carriers at Midway
- I-168 ensured she never made port

**Legacy:** I-168 achieved remarkable success sinking USS Yorktown after Midway. Penetrated destroyer screen, torpedoed both carrier (CV-5) and destroyer USS Hammann June 6, 1942. Yorktown capsized next day. One of most successful submarine attacks - strategic impact, finished off veteran fleet carrier. Escaped 60 depth charges after attack. Lost July 1943 to Allied ASW near New Hebrides, all hands. Commander Tanabe went down with boat. Showed Japanese submarine capability at its best - aggressive, skillful, successful. Name: I-168 (number designation).

**Historical Significance:** I-168's sinking of USS Yorktown remains one of WWII's most notable submarine achievements. Yorktown survived Coral Sea (May 1942), survived initial Midway battle (June 4, 1942), but I-168 finished her (June 6, 1942). Penetrating destroyer screen while submerged demonstrated exceptional skill. Dual success (carrier + destroyer) rare for single attack. Strategic impact significant - removed veteran carrier. But broader context: Japan lost 4 carriers at Midway (irreplaceable), US lost 1 (Yorktown, being replaced by Essex-class production). I-168's success tactical brilliance but couldn't change strategic situation. Lost 13 months later to improving Allied ASW. Represented Japanese submarine potential - when aggressive and skillful, deadly. But too often misused on convoy escort vs commerce raiding.
