**Submarine Aircraft Carriers** - I-400-class were largest submarines of WWII and only submarine aircraft carriers designed for offensive strikes. 3 built 1944-1945. Could carry 3 Aichi M6A Seiran floatplane bombers. 400 ft long, 6,560 tons submerged. 37,500 nm range - could circle globe 1.5 times. Unique strategic weapons. Surrendered 1945, never saw combat.

**Key Specs:** 3,530/6,560 tons | 400ft | 18.7/6.5 kn | 3 aircraft + 1× 140mm + 8× 533mm torpedoes + 20 torpedoes | 3 ships

**Innovation:** Largest submarines built until nuclear age (1960s). Only submarine aircraft carriers with offensive bomber capability. Waterproof hangar could store 3 Aichi M6A Seiran attack floatplanes. Aircraft could be launched in 30 minutes. Range of 37,500 nm allowed strike on any target in Pacific (including US West Coast or Panama Canal). Revolutionary concept - submarine carrier for strategic strikes. Remained largest non-nuclear submarines until 1960s.

**Design:** Massive hull 400 feet long. Waterproof aircraft hangar (115 ft long, 11.5 ft diameter) forward of conning tower. One catapult on deck. Three aircraft stored disassembled. Could launch all three in 30 minutes, recover (water landing) in 45 minutes. Heavy armament for self-defense. Large fuel capacity for extreme range. Schnorkel fitted. Anechoic coating (rubber) for stealth.

**Ships:**
- **I-400** - Commissioned December 30, 1944, surrendered August 1945, scuttled by US June 4, 1946 (Hawaii)
- **I-401** - Commissioned January 8, 1945, surrendered August 1945, scuttled by US May 31, 1946 (Hawaii)
- **I-402** - Commissioned July 24, 1945, surrendered August 1945, scrapped 1946 (Sasebo)
- **I-403 to I-405** - Cancelled incomplete (30-90% complete)

**Construction:**
- **I-400:** Kure Naval Arsenal, laid down January 18, 1943, launched January 18, 1944, commissioned December 30, 1944
- **I-401:** Sasebo Naval Arsenal, laid down April 26, 1943, launched March 11, 1944, commissioned January 8, 1945
- **I-402:** Kawasaki Kobe, laid down October 18, 1943, launched September 30, 1944, commissioned July 24, 1945

**Aichi M6A Seiran (Mountain Haze):**
- **Type:** Single-engine floatplane bomber
- **Crew:** 2 (pilot, observer/gunner)
- **Armament:** 1× 800 kg (1,764 lb) bomb or torpedo, 1× 13mm machine gun (rear)
- **Speed:** 295 mph (474 km/h)
- **Range:** 740 nm (1,370 km)
- **Unique:** Designed specifically for submarine operations
- **Storage:** Wings and floats removed, stored in hangar, reassembled on deck
- **Launch time:** 7 minutes per aircraft (30 minutes for all three)

**Intended Missions:**
1. **Operation PX** - Strike Panama Canal locks (primary mission)
   - 10 submarines planned (I-400, I-401, others)
   - 30 Seiran bombers
   - Goal: Close canal for months, isolate Pacific from Atlantic
   - **Cancelled** - diverted to Ulithi mission

2. **Operation Hikari** - Strike Ulithi Atoll (US fleet anchorage)
   - I-400, I-401 to attack with 6 Seiran bombers
   - August 1945 mission (during final approach)
   - **Cancelled** - Japan surrendered August 15, 1945
   - Submarines scuttled aircraft, torpedoes at sea, surfaced to surrender

3. **Various proposals:**
   - Bomb US West Coast cities (San Francisco, Los Angeles)
   - Attack US East Coast (New York, Washington)
   - Strategic targets (dams, industrial facilities)
   - Biological warfare (rejected by Navy leadership)

**Service:**
- **I-400 (Dec 1944 - Aug 1945):**
  - Training and shakedown (Jan-July 1945)
  - Operation Hikari (August 1945) - heading to Ulithi when war ended
  - Scuttled 6 Seiran aircraft at sea
  - Surrendered to USS Segundo August 29, 1945
  - Sailed to Sasebo under US Navy crew
  - Scuttled off Hawaii June 4, 1946 (prevent Soviet examination)

- **I-401 (Jan 1945 - Aug 1945):**
  - Training and shakedown
  - Operation Hikari - with I-400
  - Scuttled 3 Seiran aircraft at sea
  - Surrendered to USS Segundo August 29, 1945
  - Sailed to Sasebo, then Pearl Harbor
  - Scuttled off Hawaii May 31, 1946

- **I-402 (July 1945 - Aug 1945):**
  - Commissioned only 3 weeks before surrender
  - Converted to tanker (never carried aircraft operationally)
  - Surrendered Maizuru
  - Scrapped Sasebo 1946

**Strategic Concept:**
- **Yamamoto's vision:** Submarines that could strike anywhere in Pacific
- **Global reach:** 37,500 nm range could reach any target from Japan
- **Surprise capability:** Surface near target, launch bombers, submerge
- **Panama Canal:** Primary strategic target - closing canal would cripple US logistics
- **Terror weapon:** Psychological impact of submarine-launched air raids on US mainland

**Why Never Used Effectively:**
1. **Late completion:** I-400/I-401 commissioned Dec 1944/Jan 1945 (war nearly lost)
2. **Mission changes:** Panama plan cancelled, diverted to Ulithi
3. **War ended:** August 15, 1945 surrender before Ulithi attack
4. **Training time:** Complex operations required months of training
5. **Vulnerability:** Large size made them slower to dive, easier to detect

**Post-War:**
- **US examination:** Studied extensively at Pearl Harbor
- **Technology capture:** US evaluated submarine carrier concept
- **Soviet interest:** USSR requested access, US refused
- **Scuttled:** Deliberately sunk off Hawaii to prevent Soviet examination
- **Secrecy:** Details classified for years (Cold War secrecy)

**Rediscovery:**
- **I-401 wreck:** Located March 2005 by University of Hawaii researchers (2,300 ft depth off Oahu)
- **I-400 wreck:** Located August 2013 by NOAA (2,300 ft depth off Oahu)
- **I-14 wreck** (related submarine carrier): Located 2017

**Legacy:** Most ambitious submarine design of WWII. Represented Japan's desperation to strike strategic targets. Concept ahead of its time - submarine-launched strategic strikes predated SLBMs by 15 years. Showed Japan's technical innovation and strategic vision. Too little, too late - built when war already lost. Influenced post-war submarine development (missile submarines). Remained largest non-nuclear submarines until 1960s. Demonstrated feasibility of submarine aircraft carriers. Name "Sen-Toku" means "Special Submarine" - fitting for unique design.

**Technical Achievement:**
- Engineering marvel - 400-foot pressure hull
- Waterproof hangar with complex door mechanisms
- Catapult system on submarine deck
- Sophisticated air system for hangar
- Long-range diesel engines (most fuel-efficient submarine)
- Schnorkel and anechoic coating (stealth)

**Historical Significance:** I-400 class represented Japan's last hope for strategic surprise attacks. Panama Canal mission could have significantly impacted US logistics. Ulithi attack might have damaged US Pacific Fleet. US West Coast raids would have terrorized civilians. Never fulfilled potential due to late completion and Japan's defeat. Technology and concept influenced Cold War submarine warfare (Regulus cruise missile submarines). Embodied Japanese innovation and desperation in final year of war.
