**Submarine Killer** - I-176 was an experimental fleet submarine. 1 boat commissioned 1938. Six torpedo tubes, 12 torpedoes. Famous for sinking USS Corvina (SS-226) submarine November 1943 - rare submarine-vs-submarine kill, only confirmed Japanese sub kill of US sub. I-176 sunk April 1944 by destroyer escort USS Manilla Bay. Brief combat career but notable for unique achievement.

**Key Specs:** 1,630/2,300 tons | 347ft | 20/8 kn | 6× 533mm tubes (12 torpedoes) + 100mm gun | 1 boat

**Innovation:** Experimental KD7-type (Kaidai-type 7). Refined earlier KD designs. Good range (8,000 nm), standard speed (20/8 knots). Six bow torpedo tubes. 76-man crew. Achieved rare feat - sinking enemy submarine (USS Corvina, November 1943). Only confirmed Japanese submarine kill of US submarine in WWII. Most submarine kills by surface ships or aircraft. Sub-vs-sub combat rare. I-176's achievement unusual. Lost April 1944 to depth charges.

**Design:** Experimental refinement of Kaidai series. Six bow torpedo tubes. 12 torpedoes carried. 100mm deck gun. Diesel-electric propulsion. Good surface speed (20 knots). Slow submerged (8 knots - typical for era). Adequate range (8,000 nm). Double-hull construction. Dive depth ~250 feet. Standard Japanese submarine design. Good habitability. Radar detection equipment (late war). Only one built (experimental).

**Boat:**
- **I-176** - Sunk May 16, 1944 (depth charges, destroyer escort USS Manilla Bay, near Biak), all hands lost

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** March 1937
- **Launched:** March 23, 1938
- **Commissioned:** July 30, 1938

**Service History:**

**Pre-War (1938-1941):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- China operations
- Patrol duties
- 3 years peacetime service

**WWII (1941-1944):**

**December 1941 - Pearl Harbor:**
- Part of submarine force
- Patrolled Hawaiian area
- No confirmed kills

**1942: Various Patrols:**
- Solomons area
- Convoy hunting
- Few successes
- US ASW improving

**November 16, 1943 - Sinking of USS Corvina:**
*Rare submarine-vs-submarine kill*

**Background:**
- **USS Corvina (SS-226):** Gato-class submarine
- On patrol near Truk
- I-176 also on patrol
- Both submerged

**November 16, 1943:**
**Evening:**
- I-176 detected USS Corvina (periscope or hydrophones)
- Corvina unaware of I-176
- I-176 in perfect attack position

**Attack:**
- **I-176 fired spread of torpedoes** (submerged)
- **At least one torpedo hit USS Corvina**
- Massive explosion (likely magazine hit)
- **USS Corvina sank immediately**
- **All 82 hands lost** - no survivors
- Corvina never reported in again

**Significance:**
- **Only confirmed Japanese submarine kill of US submarine**
- Rare submarine-vs-submarine combat
- Most sub kills by destroyers, aircraft
- I-176's greatest achievement
- USS Corvina only US submarine sunk by Japanese submarine

**How Rare:**
**WWII Submarine-vs-Submarine Kills:**
- **Total:** Very few (~5-10 confirmed)
- **I-176 vs USS Corvina:** Only IJN sub kill of US sub
- **Compare:** USS Batfish sank 3 Japanese subs (Feb 1945)
- **Compare:** USS Archer-Fish sank Shinano (carrier, not sub)

**Why So Rare:**
1. **Detection difficult:** Both submerged, quiet
2. **Speed:** Submarines slow submerged (8 knots)
3. **Position:** Hard to get attack angle
4. **Identification:** Dangerous to attack unknown contacts
5. **Tactics:** Subs hunt ships, not each other

**Result:** Sub-vs-sub combat exceptional

**1944 - Continued Patrols:**
- New Guinea area
- Convoy attacks
- Few successes
- Allied ASW deadly by 1944

**May 16, 1944 - Sinking:**
*Near Biak, New Guinea*

**Background:**
- I-176 on patrol near Biak
- US invasion of Biak in progress
- Heavy ASW screen
- **USS Manila Bay (CVE-61):** Escort carrier with ASW aircraft

**May 16, 1944:**
**Morning:**
- US aircraft detected I-176 (radar or visual)
- Attack begun
- I-176 crash-dived

**Attack:**
- **Depth charges from aircraft**
- I-176 damaged, forced deep
- **USS Robert F. Keller (DE-419):** Destroyer escort joined attack
- Multiple depth charge runs
- Sustained damage

**Fatal Attack:**
- USS Manila Bay's aircraft continued attacks
- Coordinated with destroyer escort
- **Depth charges bracketed I-176**
- Fatal damage
- **Sank with all hands** (76 crew)
- No survivors

**USS Corvina Details:**
*The Victim*

**Background:**
- **USS Corvina (SS-226):** Gato-class submarine
- Commissioned August 6, 1943
- Brand new (3 months service)
- First war patrol
- Headed for patrol area near Truk

**November 16, 1943:**
- Last radio contact
- Never heard from again
- Missing status
- Later confirmed sunk by I-176

**Casualties:**
- **All 82 hands lost**
- No survivors
- No distress signals
- Quick sinking (torpedo hit magazine)

**Post-War:**
- Declassified records confirmed I-176 kill
- Only US submarine lost to Japanese submarine

**Comparison - Submarine Kills:**

**Japanese Submarines Sinking US Submarines:**
| Japanese Sub | US Sub Sunk | Date | Location |
|--------------|-------------|------|----------|
| **I-176** | **USS Corvina (SS-226)** | **Nov 16, 1943** | **Near Truk** |
| (None others confirmed) | - | - | - |

**US Submarines Sinking Japanese Submarines:**
| US Sub | Japanese Sub Sunk | Date |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| USS Batfish | I-41, RO-55, RO-112 | Feb 1945 (3 in 4 days!) |
| USS Scamp | I-168 | Claimed (not confirmed) |
| USS Tang | Transport, not sub | - |

**Asymmetry:** US subs sank multiple Japanese subs, I-176 only IJN success

**Why I-176 Succeeded:**

**Factors:**
1. **Position:** Perfect attack angle
2. **Detection:** Found Corvina first
3. **Surprise:** Corvina unaware
4. **Accuracy:** Torpedo hit vital area
5. **Luck:** Right place, right time

**Rare Achievement:** Only 1 confirmed kill of US sub by Japanese sub in entire war

**Loss Analysis:**

**I-176's Vulnerability (May 1944):**
1. **Allied air superiority:** Aircraft everywhere
2. **Radar:** US radar detected subs surfaced
3. **ASW tactics:** Coordinated air + surface attacks
4. **Depth charges:** Improved depth charges lethal
5. **Hunter-killer groups:** CVE + destroyers deadly combination

**Result:** Even successful sub (Corvina kill) couldn't survive 1944 environment

**Legacy:** I-176 achieved rare distinction - sinking enemy submarine (USS Corvina, November 1943). Only confirmed Japanese submarine kill of US submarine in WWII. Sub-vs-sub combat exceptionally rare - most subs killed by destroyers or aircraft. I-176's success showed Japanese submarines could be deadly when properly employed. But lost 6 months later (May 1944) to coordinated air/surface ASW - showed Allied dominance by 1944. Brief combat career (1941-1944) but notable for unique achievement. Name: I-176 (number designation).

**Historical Significance:** I-176's sinking of USS Corvina remains unique - only confirmed Japanese submarine kill of US submarine in WWII. Extremely rare achievement (sub-vs-sub kills < 10 total WWII). Shows how difficult submarine-vs-submarine combat was - both submerged, slow (8 knots), detection hard. But when positioned correctly (I-176 found Corvina first), deadly. Corvina new submarine (3 months old, first patrol) - all 82 lost. I-176's success short-lived - lost 6 months later to US escort carrier + destroyer team. Showed that by 1944, Allied ASW so effective even successful Japanese submarines couldn't survive. Asymmetry telling: I-176 sank 1 US sub (Corvina), US subs sank many Japanese subs plus I-176 herself (eventually). Represented Japanese submarine potential but also ultimate defeat to Allied numbers and technology.
