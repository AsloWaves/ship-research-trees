**Improved Fleet Submarines** - I-5-Class were improved Kaidai Type II fleet submarines. 3 boats commissioned 1932. Larger and faster than I-1-Class (Kaidai I): 2,300 tons submerged, 18 knots surface. Six 21-inch torpedo tubes, 16 torpedoes carried. 10,000 nm range (trans-Pacific). One 4.7-inch deck gun. All 3 served WWII from Pearl Harbor (December 1941). All 3 lost (100% loss). I-6 sank USS Seawolf SS-197 (October 1944) in friendly fire incident - thought to be American submarine. Refined Kaidai design with incremental improvements. Evolved into larger I-9-Class and specialized types.

**Key Specs:** 1,750/2,300 tons | 331ft | 18/8 kn | 6× 533mm torpedo tubes | 16 torpedoes | 1× 120mm | 245ft test depth | 10,000 nm range | 3 boats

**Innovation:** Refined Kaidai Type II fleet submarine design (1932). Improved over I-1-Class (Kaidai I): Larger (2,300 vs 2,135 tons submerged). Faster (18 vs 17.5 knots surface). More torpedoes (16 vs 14). More powerful diesels (6,800 vs 4,700 shp). Same philosophy: Trans-Pacific range (10,000 nm), fleet speed, scouting for battlefleet, attack enemy capital ships. Six 21-inch torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern). One 4.7-inch deck gun. 245-foot test depth. Crew 76. All 3 served entire war (Pearl Harbor December 1941 through 1944). All 3 lost 1944 (I-7 June, I-5 July, I-6 October - 100% loss). I-6's final victim: USS Seawolf SS-197 (friendly fire - Japanese thought American submarine was one of theirs). Showed incremental Kaidai improvements but ultimately vulnerable to Allied ASW.

**Design:** Large fleet submarine hull (331 ft, 2,300 tons submerged). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes - 4 in bow (salvo attacks), 2 in stern (escape shots). 16 torpedoes total (generous reload capacity - improved over I-1's 14). One 4.7-inch deck gun forward (surface attacks, merchant raiding). One 13mm AA machine gun. Two 7.7mm machine guns. Diesel-electric propulsion: Two diesel engines surface (6,800 shp - more powerful than I-1-Class), electric motors submerged (1,800 shp). Two shafts. 18 knots surface (half-knot faster than I-1), 8 knots submerged. 10,000 nm range surface (trans-Pacific operations). 245-foot test depth. Crew 76. Fleet submarine design: Scout for battlefleet, attack enemy capital ships, long-range patrols, cruiser speed on surface.

  - Indian Ocean operations showed range

**Mid-War (1942-1943):**

**All Three:**
- Aleutian Islands campaigns
- Guadalcanal operations
- Supply runs to isolated garrisons
- Anti-shipping patrols
- Being pushed back as Allies advanced

**Late War (1944):**

**Accelerating Losses:**

**I-7 (June 22, 1944):**
- Operating near Guam during Allied invasion
- Detected by destroyer escort hunter-killer group
- USS Riddle DE-185, Swearer DE-186, Stern DE-187
- Coordinated depth charge attack
- I-7 sunk, 101 killed (all hands)

**I-5 (July 19, 1944):**
- Saipan-Guam area (one month after I-7 loss)
- Attacked by submarine chaser PC-1135 and aircraft
- Depth charges
- I-5 sunk, 95 killed (all hands)

**I-6 (October 3, 1944):**
- Philippines area near Morotai
- Detected by USS Shelton DE-407 and Rowell DE-403
- Depth charge attack
- I-6 sunk, 91 killed (all hands)
- **I-6's final victim before being sunk: USS Seawolf SS-197**

**USS Seawolf Friendly Fire Incident:**

**Background:**
- **USS Seawolf SS-197** (Sargo-class fleet submarine)
- One of most successful American submarines (18 ships sunk)
- Operating near Morotai (October 1944)

**The Incident (October 3, 1944):**
- Seawolf on special mission (delivering supplies)
- I-6 detected submarine contact
- Identified as enemy (thought to be American submarine)
- **I-6 attacked and sank submarine**
- Submarine was **actually USS Seawolf** (friendly fire!)
- **83 Americans killed** (all hands)

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- Same day, I-6 detected by USS Shelton DE-407 and Rowell DE-403
- Depth charged and sunk
- 91 Japanese killed (all hands)
- I-6's final action: Sinking friendly submarine by mistake

**Tragedy:**
- Seawolf lost to friendly fire
- I-6 lost hours later
- Total deaths: 83 Americans + 91 Japanese = 174 men
- One of war's tragic ironies

**Why Friendly Fire:**
1. **Submarine recognition difficult:** All submarines look similar underwater
2. **Combat zone:** Area had both American and Japanese submarines
3. **I-6 acted correctly:** Attacked what seemed like enemy submarine
4. **Fog of war:** Seawolf on secret mission, I-6 didn't know
5. **No fault:** Tragic accident, not negligence

**Why 100% Loss:**

**All 3 Sunk 1944:**
- I-7: June 22, 1944
- I-5: July 19, 1944
- I-6: October 3, 1944
- Concentrated losses (3.5 months from first to last)

**Reasons:**
1. **Allied ASW dominance by 1944:** Radar, sonar, hunter-killer groups
2. **Marianas/Philippines campaigns:** Heavy Allied naval presence
3. **Code breaking:** Allies knew patrol areas
4. **Air superiority:** Constant air patrols
5. **Destroyer escorts:** Specialized ASW ships effective
6. **Experience:** Allied crews highly trained by 1944
7. **Older boats:** 12-7 years old, less capable than newer submarines

**Comparison - Kaidai Types:**
| Class | Kaidai Type | Year | Tons (sub) | Speed (surf/sub) | Torpedoes | Built | Lost | Loss % |
|-------|-------------|------|------------|------------------|-----------|-------|------|--------|
| I-1 | Type I | 1926-29 | 2,135 | 17.5/8 kn | 14 | 4 | 4 | 100% |
| **I-5** | **Type II** | **1932** | **2,300** | **18/8 kn** | **16** | **3** | **3** | **100%** |
| I-121 | Type III | 1927 | 1,635 | 17/7.5 kn | 12 | 4 | 4 | 100% |
| I-54 | Type VI | 1943-44 | 2,215 | 17.7/6.5 kn | 19 | 3 | 3 | 100% |

**All Kaidai types suffered 100% losses - fleet submarine concept vulnerable**

**Incremental Improvements I-1 → I-5:**

**Size:**
- I-1: 2,135 tons submerged
- I-5: 2,300 tons submerged
- +165 tons (8% larger)

**Speed:**
- I-1: 17.5 knots surface
- I-5: 18 knots surface
- +0.5 knots

**Torpedoes:**
- I-1: 14 torpedoes
- I-5: 16 torpedoes
- +2 torpedoes (14% more)

**Power:**
- I-1: 4,700 shp surface
- I-5: 6,800 shp surface
- +2,100 shp (45% more powerful)

**Philosophy:**
- Incremental refinement
- Not revolutionary
- Modest improvements
- Proven design evolved

**Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942):**

**I-5 and I-7 Participated:**
- Japanese carrier force (Kido Butai) raided Indian Ocean
- I-5 and I-7 accompanied as scouts
- Submarines attacked merchant shipping
- I-7 sank British freighter Taksang
- Showed trans-Pacific range capability (Japan → Indian Ocean = 6,000+ nm)

**Significance:**
- Demonstrated fleet submarine doctrine
- Long-range operations successful
- But: Submarines more vulnerable than carriers
- Better used elsewhere

**Legacy:** I-5-Class refined Kaidai Type I design with incremental improvements. 3 boats (1932, 1935, 1937) commissioned interwar period. Larger (2,300 tons), faster (18 knots), more torpedoes (16) than I-1-Class. All 3 served entire WWII from Pearl Harbor (December 1941) through 1944. All 3 lost June-October 1944 (100% loss - I-7, I-5, I-6). I-6's final victim: USS Seawolf SS-197 (friendly fire - tragic mistake, 83 Americans killed). I-5 and I-7 participated Indian Ocean raid (April 1942) showing trans-Pacific range. Showed Kaidai philosophy worked (trans-Pacific capability) but vulnerable to Allied ASW (radar, destroyer escorts, air patrols, code breaking). Evolution: I-1 (Kaidai I, 1926) → I-5 (Kaidai II, 1932) → I-9 (Kaidai IIIa, 1941) = incremental improvements same basic design.

**Historical Significance:** I-5-Class represented Japanese fleet submarine evolution. Commissioned 1932-1937 (interwar period) when naval treaties limited capital ships but not submarines. Japan invested heavily in fleet submarines: Kaidai Type II refined Type I with larger size, more speed, more torpedoes. Philosophy: Trans-Pacific range (10,000 nm), fleet speed (18 knots), scout for battlefleet, attack enemy capital ships. All 3 fought entire war (December 1941-1944). All 3 lost 1944 when Allied ASW dominant. I-6's tragedy: Sank USS Seawolf SS-197 (friendly fire) hours before being sunk itself - 174 total deaths (83 Americans, 91 Japanese). Showed fleet submarine doctrine had flaws: Large boats vulnerable, better used for commerce raiding (like German U-boats) than scouting. Evolution visible: I-5 (1932, conventional, 100% loss) vs Ha-201 (1945, revolutionary high-speed, 0% loss). Too late for revolutionary designs. I-5-Class: Fought well, lost to superior Allied technology/tactics.
