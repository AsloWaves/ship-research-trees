**Underwater Transports** - I-351-class were Japanese transport submarines. 3 boats commissioned 1944-1945. Purpose-built cargo submarines - 300 tons cargo capacity, could carry 50-60 troops. No torpedoes (pure transport). Large (3,512/4,290 tons), slow (15.8/6.3 knots). Desperate late-war design for supplying isolated garrisons when surface shipping impossible. All three lost 1945 (100% loss rate). I-351 sunk by USS Bluefish July 1945. Showed Japan's supply crisis - building submarines without weapons to sneak cargo past Allied blockade.

**Key Specs:** 3,512/4,290 tons | 361ft | 15.8/6.3 kn | NO torpedoes | 300 tons cargo + 50-60 troops | 13,000 nm range | 3 boats

**Innovation:** Purpose-built transport submarines (not converted). Large cargo hold (300 tons capacity). Could carry troops (50-60), ammunition, food, fuel. No torpedo tubes (space used for cargo). Single shaft (simplicity). Minimal armament (one 25mm AA gun - defensive only). Designed to evade Allied air/surface blockade by traveling submerged. Late-war desperation - Japan's isolated garrisons starving, surface ships couldn't reach them, submarines only option. All three lost 1945 before accomplishing much. I-351 to USS Bluefish (July 1945). Others scuttled or lost. 100% loss rate. Showed strategic bankruptcy - submarines without weapons, carrying rice instead of torpedoes.

**Design:** Large submarine hull (361 ft, 3,512 tons surfaced). Huge cargo hold amidships (300 tons capacity). Could carry: ammunition, food, medical supplies, fuel, 50-60 troops. No torpedo tubes (cargo space priority). Single 25mm AA gun (minimal defense). Single shaft diesel-electric propulsion. Slow (15.8 knots surfaced, 6.3 submerged - penalty for cargo). Long range (13,000 nm - reach distant islands). Crew 90. Designed for supply runs to isolated garrisons: Philippines, Marianas, Carolines, Marshalls. Submerge when threatened, surface to unload cargo. Pure transport - combat avoidance priority.

**Boats (3 built - all lost):**

**All lost 1945:**
1. **I-351** - Sunk July 14, 1945 (submarine USS Bluefish, Sea of Japan), all hands lost
2. **I-352** - Fate unclear (possibly scuttled August 1945 or lost to mine)
3. **I-353** - Scuttled August 1945 (incomplete or damaged)

**Construction:**

**I-351:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** May 1, 1943
- **Launched:** September 15, 1943
- **Commissioned:** October 31, 1944

**I-352:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Commissioned:** July 25, 1945 (very late)

**I-353:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Commissioned:** January 14, 1945

**Service History:**

**I-351 (October 1944 - July 1945):**

**October 1944 - June 1945:**
- Work-up and training
- Supply missions attempted
- Few successful runs (Allied dominance)
- Transported supplies to Philippines
- Limited success

**July 1945: Final Mission:**
- **Mission:** Transport run to isolated garrison
- **Route:** Sea of Japan

**July 14, 1945:**
- **USS Bluefish (SS-222)** on patrol
- Detected I-351 surfaced
- Fired torpedoes
- **Multiple hits**
- **I-351 sank with all hands** (~90 killed)
- Cargo lost
- One month before surrender

**I-352 and I-353 (1945):**

**Limited Service:**
- I-352 commissioned July 25, 1945 (21 days before surrender)
- I-353 commissioned January 1945 (7 months of war left)
- Probably limited or no combat missions
- War situation desperate
- **Scuttled or lost August 1945**
- Details unclear (chaos of surrender)

**Why Built:**

**Japan's Supply Crisis (1944-1945):**

**Problem:**
1. **Allied blockade:** Surface ships sunk rapidly
2. **Air dominance:** Allied aircraft everywhere
3. **Island garrisons:** Tens of thousands of troops isolated
4. **Starvation:** No food reaching islands
5. **Ammunition:** Troops without supplies to fight

**Solution (Desperate):**
1. **Submarines:** Could evade detection
2. **Transport:** Carry vital supplies
3. **Submerged transit:** Avoid air/surface hunters
4. **Small loads:** Better than nothing

**I-351-Class:**
- Purpose-built for this mission
- 300 tons cargo (small compared to merchant ship but huge for submarine)
- Could reach isolated islands
- Only way to get supplies through

**But:**
- Too little, too late
- Only 3 boats built
- All lost
- Couldn't solve strategic problem

**300-Ton Cargo Capacity:**

**Large for Submarine:**
- Merchant ship: 5,000-10,000+ tons
- **I-351: 300 tons** (tiny compared to merchant ship)
- But: Submarine (could evade blockade)

**Could Carry:**
- Rice: Feed garrison for weeks
- Ammunition: Bullets, shells
- Medical supplies: Medicine, bandages
- Fuel: Limited amounts
- Troops: 50-60 soldiers/technicians
- Equipment: Radios, parts, tools

**Problem:**
- 300 tons not enough for large garrison
- Philippines garrison: 250,000 troops
- 300 tons = few days food
- Futile mission

**No Torpedoes:**

**Trade-Off:**
- Torpedo tubes + torpedoes + reload mechanisms = space
- **I-351: Removed all torpedoes**
- Space used for cargo hold
- Pure transport (no combat capability)

**Defense:**
- Single 25mm AA gun (minimal)
- **Primary defense:** Submerge and evade
- Avoid combat entirely
- If detected surfaced: Probably doomed

**Result:**
- Vulnerable submarines
- If caught surfaced: Easy targets
- All three lost

**Comparison - Transport Submarines:**
| Class | Nation | Displacement | Cargo | Torpedoes | Built | Lost |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| **I-351** | **Japan** | **3,512/4,290** | **300 tons** | **0** | **3** | **3** |
| U-cruisers | Germany | 1,600/2,000 | ~200 tons | 4-6 | Some | Most lost |
| R-class | USA | 570/680 | Minimal | 4 | Many | Few lost (coastal) |

**I-351: Largest, most specialized, 100% lost**

**USS Bluefish vs I-351 (July 14, 1945):**

**Background:**
- **USS Bluefish (SS-222):** Successful fleet submarine
- Sea of Japan patrol (dangerous waters)
- I-351 on supply mission

**July 14, 1945:**
**Detection:**
- I-351 surfaced (transit or battery charging)
- USS Bluefish detected via periscope
- Perfect position

**Attack:**
- Fired spread of torpedoes
- Multiple hits on I-351
- Large submarine (easy target)
- **Sank rapidly**
- All hands lost
- Cargo lost (wasted mission)

**Significance:**
- One month before surrender
- I-351's entire service futile
- Commissioned October 1944, sunk July 1945
- 8 months service, zero success, all crew dead

**Why 100% Loss Rate:**

**Strategic Futility:**
1. **Too late:** Built 1944-1945 when war already lost
2. **Too few:** 3 boats couldn't solve supply crisis
3. **Too slow:** 6.3 knots submerged (vulnerable)
4. **Too specialized:** No weapons if detected
5. **Allied dominance:** By 1945 total

**Tactical Vulnerability:**
1. **Size:** Large submarines (easy to detect)
2. **No torpedoes:** Defenseless if engaged
3. **Slow:** Couldn't escape hunters
4. **Surfacing:** Needed to surface often (large diesel, limited batteries)
5. **Cargo:** Slow to dive (heavy cargo)

**Legacy:** I-351-class represented Japan's late-war desperation. Three purpose-built transport submarines (1944-1945) to supply isolated garrisons. 300 tons cargo capacity, could carry 50-60 troops, no torpedoes (pure transport). Designed to evade Allied blockade by traveling submerged. All three lost 1945 (100% loss rate). I-351 to USS Bluefish (July 14, 1945, one month before surrender). Showed strategic bankruptcy - submarines without weapons, carrying rice instead of torpedoes, trying to solve unsolvable supply crisis. Too little, too late. Names: I-351, I-352, I-353 (number designations).

**Historical Significance:** I-351-class epitomized Japan's late-war futility. Built 1944-1945 to supply 250,000+ troops isolated on Pacific islands. But 300 tons cargo (few days food) couldn't solve crisis. Three boats vs hundreds of thousands starving soldiers = mathematical impossibility. No torpedoes - combat submarines converted to underwater trucks. All three lost within months (100% loss rate). I-351 commissioned October 1944, sunk July 1945 (8 months), accomplished nothing, all crew dead. Compare to USA: Building fleet submarines with 24 torpedoes to sink Japanese shipping. Japan: Building submarines with zero torpedoes to carry rice. Strategic collapse visible. Represented wrong tool, wrong time, wrong war. Should have prevented supply crisis (defend sea lanes) not tried to solve it (submarine rice delivery). Too late when solution is submarine grocery delivery.
