**Transitional Submarines** - L-Class were transitional Japanese submarines. 4 boats commissioned 1920-1921. Medium size (1,060 tons submerged - 19× larger than No. 1-Class!). Diesel-electric, 16 knots surface, 10 knots submerged. Six 21-inch torpedo tubes, 10 torpedoes. One 3-inch deck gun. 5,000 nm range. All 4 served interwar period only (1920-1935). All scrapped 1935 when obsolete (15 years service). Never saw combat. Bridge between primitive gasoline boats (No. 1-Class 1905) and modern fleet submarines (I-1-Class 1926). Tested technologies and doctrine for later Kaidai types.

**Key Specs:** 690/1,060 tons | 239ft | 16/10 kn | 6× 533mm torpedo tubes | 10 torpedoes | 1× 76mm | 165ft test depth | 5,000 nm range | 4 boats

**Innovation:** Critical transitional submarine design (1920-1921). Bridge between primitive early boats and modern fleet submarines. Medium size (1,060 tons submerged - much larger than No. 1's 63 tons, smaller than I-1's 2,135 tons). Diesel-electric propulsion (reliable, safe - no gasoline fumes). 16 knots surface (adequate for era). 10 knots submerged (very fast for 1920 - most submarines 6-8 knots). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern - modern layout). 10 torpedoes total. One 3-inch deck gun. 5,000 nm range (regional operations - not yet trans-Pacific). 165-foot test depth. Crew 43. All 4 commissioned 1920-1921 immediately after WWI. All scrapped 1935 when Kaidai types (I-1, I-5, I-121) proved superior. Never saw combat - interwar training only. Proved concepts for later designs.

**Design:** Medium submarine hull (239 ft, 1,060 tons submerged). Six 21-inch torpedo tubes - 4 in bow (forward attacks), 2 in stern (escape shots). 10 torpedoes total. One 3-inch deck gun forward (surface attacks). One 6.5mm AA machine gun. Diesel-electric propulsion: Two diesel engines surface (2,400 shp total), electric motors submerged (1,200 shp). Two shafts. 16 knots surface, 10 knots submerged (fast underwater for 1920). 5,000 nm range surface. 165-foot test depth (deeper than early boats, shallower than fleet submarines). Crew 43. Designed for fleet operations - scouting, torpedo attacks, training - but not trans-Pacific range yet. Transitional technology between primitive and modern.

**Boats (4 built - all scrapped 1935):**

**All scrapped 1935 (never saw combat):**

1. **L-1** - Commissioned July 1920, scrapped 1935
2. **L-2** - Commissioned August 1920, scrapped 1935
3. **L-3** - Commissioned April 1921, scrapped 1935
4. **L-4** - Commissioned May 1921, scrapped 1935

**Construction:**

- **Builders:** Kawasaki Shipyard, Kobe (L-1, L-2); Kure Naval Arsenal (L-3, L-4)
- **Design:** Indigenous Japanese design (not foreign license)
- **Laid down:** 1918-1919
- **Commissioned:** 1920-1921 (post-WWI)
- **Philosophy:** Learn from WWI submarine warfare, develop Japanese capabilities

**Service History:**

**Entire Service (1920-1935):**
- Training
- Fleet exercises
- Doctrine development
- Testing submarine technologies
- Crew training
- China station patrols (limited)
- **No combat** (interwar period peaceful for Japan)
- **All 4 scrapped 1935** when obsolete

**Why Transitional:**

**Between Two Eras:**

**Before L-Class (No. 1-Class, 1905):**
- 57 tons surface, 63 tons submerged
- Gasoline/electric (dangerous)
- 7 knots surface, 5 knots submerged
- 3 torpedoes total
- 50-foot test depth
- Experimental, primitive

**L-Class (1920):**
- 690 tons surface, 1,060 tons submerged (19× larger!)
- Diesel/electric (safe, reliable)
- 16 knots surface, 10 knots submerged
- 10 torpedoes
- 165-foot test depth
- Practical, transitional

**After L-Class (I-1-Class, 1926):**
- 1,635 tons surface, 2,135 tons submerged (2× L-Class)
- Diesel/electric (refined)
- 17.5 knots surface, 8 knots submerged
- 14 torpedoes
- 245-foot test depth
- Modern fleet submarine

**L-Class: Critical middle step**

**10 Knots Submerged - Very Fast:**

**Exceptional for 1920:**
- Most submarines 1920: 6-8 knots submerged
- **L-Class: 10 knots** (25-50% faster!)
- Only matched by most advanced designs

**How Achieved:**
- Streamlined hull
- Powerful electric motors (1,200 shp)
- Efficient battery system
- Good hydrodynamics

**Significance:**
- Showed Japanese submarine technology advancing
- Influenced later designs
- But: Later boats slower (I-1: 8 knots) - range/endurance prioritized over speed

**Comparison:**
- L-Class (1920): 10 knots submerged
- I-1-Class (1926): 8 knots submerged
- Ha-201-Class (1945): **13 knots submerged** (revolutionary)

**Why All Scrapped 1935:**

**15-Year Service Life:**
- Commissioned: 1920-1921
- Scrapped: 1935
- **15 years** (normal for interwar submarines)

**Obsolescence:**
1. **Better boats available:** I-1 (1926), I-5 (1932), I-121 (1927) - larger, more capable
2. **Technology advanced:** 15 years = significant improvements
3. **Size:** 1,060 tons (too small for fleet operations, too large for coastal)
4. **Range:** 5,000 nm (not trans-Pacific like 10,000 nm I-Class boats)
5. **Depth:** 165 feet (shallower than modern boats)
6. **No combat value:** Better to build new than maintain old

**Decision:**
- Scrap all 4 together (1935)
- Focus resources on modern fleet submarines
- L-Class fulfilled training/development role

**Never Saw Combat:**

**Interwar Period Only:**
- Commissioned 1920-1921 (post-WWI)
- Scrapped 1935 (6 years before WWII started December 1941)
- **No combat service**

**Role:**
- Training submariners
- Developing submarine tactics
- Testing technologies
- Fleet exercises
- Preparing for future

**Value:**
- Trained hundreds of submariners
- Tested equipment
- Developed doctrine
- **Lessons learned used in WWII boats**

**Comparison - Early Japanese Submarines:**
| Class | Year | Tons (surf/sub) | Speed (surf/sub) | Torpedoes | Service | Fate | Combat |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| **No. 1** | **1905** | **57/63** | **7/5 kn** | **3** | **15 yrs** | **Scrapped 1920** | **None** |
| **L-Class** | **1920** | **690/1,060** | **16/10 kn** | **10** | **15 yrs** | **Scrapped 1935** | **None** |
| I-1 | 1926 | 1,635/2,135 | 17.5/8 kn | 14 | 18 yrs | Lost WWII | Extensive |

**L-Class: Critical middle generation**

**5,000 nm Range:**

**Regional Operations:**
- Not trans-Pacific (I-1: 10,000 nm)
- But adequate for:
  - Japan-China (800 nm)
  - Japan-Philippines (1,500 nm)
  - Japan-Marianas (1,300 nm)
  - Regional patrols

**Limitations:**
- Couldn't reach Hawaii (3,850 nm one-way)
- Couldn't reach US West Coast (5,000 nm one-way)
- **Limited to Western Pacific**

**Later Improvement:**
- I-1-Class (1926): 10,000 nm (trans-Pacific)
- I-400-Class (1944): 37,500 nm (could circle globe!)

**Diesel-Electric - Major Advance:**

**Before: Gasoline (No. 1-Class):**
- Gasoline engines surface
- Explosive fumes
- Dangerous
- Several navies lost boats to explosions
- Limited power

**L-Class: Diesel-Electric:**
- Diesel engines surface (safe, efficient)
- Electric motors submerged
- No explosive fumes
- More power
- Better range
- Reliable

**Impact:**
- All later Japanese submarines: Diesel-electric
- Standard propulsion through WWII
- L-Class proved system reliable

**165-Foot Test Depth:**

**Deeper Than Early Boats:**
- No. 1-Class: 50 feet
- **L-Class: 165 feet** (3.3× deeper)
- I-1-Class: 245 feet (1.5× deeper)

**Significance:**
- Could dive deeper to escape surface ships
- Better pressure hull
- Improved safety
- Tested deep-diving technologies

**But Still Limited:**
- Modern submarines: 800+ feet
- WWII late boats: 300-400 feet
- L-Class: Transitional depth capability

**Crew 43 - Medium Size:**

**Manning Comparison:**
- No. 1-Class: 5 men (tiny)
- **L-Class: 43 men** (medium)
- I-1-Class: 70 men (large fleet boat)
- I-400-Class: 144 men (enormous)

**Implications:**
- Enough crew for operations
- Training role (teach many sailors)
- Not excessive (economical)
- Adequate for medium boat

**Indigenous Design:**

**Not Foreign License:**
- No. 1-Class: Holland design (American license)
- **L-Class: Japanese design** (indigenous)
- I-1-Class: Japanese design (refined)

**Significance:**
- Japan no longer dependent on foreign designs
- Developing own submarine expertise
- Technology mastery
- Foundation for later innovations

**Legacy:** L-Class represented critical transition in Japanese submarine development. 4 boats (1920-1921) bridged gap between primitive No. 1-Class (1905, 63 tons, gasoline, experimental) and modern I-1-Class (1926, 2,135 tons, diesel-electric, fleet submarine). Medium size (1,060 tons), 16/10 knots (10 knots submerged very fast for 1920!), 6 torpedo tubes, 5,000 nm range. All 4 served interwar period only - training, exercises, doctrine development. All scrapped 1935 (15 years service) when obsolete. Never saw combat. But: Trained hundreds of submariners, tested technologies, developed tactics used in WWII. Critical stepping stone: No. 1 (experimental) → L-Class (transitional) → I-1 (modern) → I-400 (revolutionary). Without L-Class learning phase, Japan couldn't have developed advanced fleet submarines.

**Historical Significance:** L-Class marked Japan's transition from submarine novice to expert. Commissioned 1920-1921 immediately after WWI when submarine warfare revolutionized naval combat (German U-boats nearly won war). Japan learned lessons: Submarines powerful, diesel-electric essential, fleet operations possible. L-Class tested concepts: Medium size (1,060 tons - 19× larger than No. 1-Class!), diesel-electric propulsion (safe, reliable), 10 knots submerged (very fast for 1920), 6 torpedo tubes (modern armament), 5,000 nm range (regional operations). All 4 never saw combat - scrapped 1935, six years before WWII. But trained hundreds of submariners who later manned I-boats in WWII. Technologies tested in L-Class refined in Kaidai types (I-1, I-5, I-121, etc.). Evolution visible: No. 1 (1905, 63 tons, gasoline, 5 knots submerged, experimental) → L-Class (1920, 1,060 tons, diesel, 10 knots submerged, transitional) → I-400 (1944, 5,223 tons, diesel, 6.5 knots submerged but aircraft-carrying). L-Class: Forgotten teachers. Trained generation that fought WWII. Foundation stones for Japanese submarine force.
