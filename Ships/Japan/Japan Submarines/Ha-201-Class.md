**Revolutionary but Too Late** - Ha-201-class were advanced Japanese coastal submarines. 10 boats commissioned 1945. Revolutionary: 13 knots submerged (faster than surfaced!) - fastest submerged speed of any WWII submarine. Small (377 tons), two torpedoes (no reloads), electric-priority design. All commissioned January-August 1945 (too late for combat). All survived war (0% loss rate - war ended before deployment). Scrapped 1945-1948. Showed Japanese submarine technology advanced but timing disastrous - revolutionary boats commissioned when war ending.

**Key Specs:** 377/440 tons | 174ft | 10.5 surfaced / **13 submerged** kn | 2× 533mm tubes (2 torpedoes, no reloads) | 10 boats

**Innovation:** Revolutionary submerged speed: 13 knots submerged vs 10.5 surfaced (first submarine faster underwater than on surface!). Electric-priority design - powerful electric motors, weak diesels. Designed for submerged operations (attack then escape underwater). Small coastal submarine (377 tons). Two bow torpedo tubes, two torpedoes (no reloads - limitation). No guns (streamlined for speed). Commissioned January-August 1945 (war's final months). None saw combat (too late). All 10 survived war, scrapped 1945-1948. Technology advanced (influenced post-war submarine designs) but wasted - war ended before boats could prove themselves. Represented what Japan could design vs when Japan could build it.

**Design:** Small streamlined hull (174 ft, 377 tons - very small). Two bow torpedo tubes. Two torpedoes total (no reloads - severe limitation). No deck gun (speed priority). Single shaft. **Powerful electric motor (1,250 shp)** for 13 knots submerged. Weak diesel engine (400 shp) for 10.5 knots surfaced. Streamlined for underwater speed - smooth hull, minimal protrusions. Crew 22 (small). Battery-heavy design (large batteries for sustained submerged speed). Designed for: Submerge, approach target at 13 knots, fire 2 torpedoes, escape at 13 knots. Coastal defense concept - defend home waters from invasion fleet.

10. **Ha-210** - Commissioned August 15, 1945, scrapped 1948 (same day as surrender!)

**Construction:**
- Builders: Multiple yards (mass production program)
- Laid down: 1944-1945
- Commissioned: January-August 1945
- **Ha-210 commissioned August 15, 1945** - same day Japan surrendered!

**Service History:**

**All 10 Boats:**

**1945:**
- Commissioned during war's final months
- Training only (no time for combat deployment)
- War situation desperate
- Allied invasion of Japan expected
- Designed for coastal defense of home islands
- **But: War ended before deployment**

**None saw combat:**
- Ha-201 through Ha-207: Commissioned months before surrender, but not deployed
- Ha-208 through Ha-210: Commissioned days before/same day as surrender
- **Zero combat missions**
- **Zero torpedoes fired in anger**

**August 15, 1945: Surrender:**
- All 10 boats at Japanese ports
- Intact (no combat damage)
- Surrendered to Allies
- Examined by US Navy (technology interest)

**Post-War (1945-1948):**
- US Navy inspections
- Technology studied (submerged speed revolutionary)
- **Influenced post-war submarine designs** (US, USSR)
- Scrapped 1946-1948 (no longer needed)
- None given to Allies (unlike some other ships)

**13 Knots Submerged - Revolutionary:**

**Why Revolutionary:**

**Traditional Submarines (WWII):**
- **Surfaced:** Fast (15-20 knots) - diesel engines powerful
- **Submerged:** Slow (7-9 knots) - batteries limited
- **Tactic:** Surface to travel/attack, submerge to hide

**Ha-201-Class:**
- **Surfaced:** Slow (10.5 knots) - weak diesels
- **Submerged:** Fast (13 knots) - powerful electric motors
- **Tactic:** Stay submerged always, attack submerged, escape submerged

**Advantages:**
1. **Stealth:** Never surface (harder to detect)
2. **Speed:** Catch surface ships while submerged
3. **Escape:** Fast escape after attack
4. **Safety:** Less vulnerable (submerged always safer)

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Battery limited:** Couldn't sustain 13 knots long
2. **Range:** Poor surfaced range (weak diesels)
3. **Slow charging:** Weak diesels = slow battery recharge
4. **Two torpedoes:** Limited ammunition

**Why Faster Submerged:**

**Design Priority:**
- Large battery banks (heavy)
- Powerful electric motor (1,250 shp electric vs 400 shp diesel)
- Streamlined hull (underwater efficiency)
- Single shaft (simplicity)

**Result:**
- Electric power > Diesel power
- Submerged speed > Surfaced speed
- **First submarine to achieve this**

**Why Only 2 Torpedoes:**

**Trade-Off:**
- Small hull (377 tons - very small)
- Two bow tubes
- Space for two torpedoes only
- **No reloads** (no reload mechanism, no storage space)

**Problem:**
- Fire two torpedoes, then return to base
- No second attack
- Severe limitation for combat

**Rationale:**
- Coastal defense (bases nearby)
- Quick attack, return, reload at base
- Mass production (many boats = many attacks)
- But: Never tested in combat

**Comparison - Fast Submarines:**
| Class | Nation | Year | Surfaced | Submerged | Torpedoes | Built |
|-------|--------|------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Ha-201** | **Japan** | **1945** | **10.5 kn** | **13 kn** | **2** | **10** |
| XXI | Germany | 1944-45 | 15.6 kn | 17.2 kn | 23 | 118 |
| Gato | USA | 1941-43 | 20 kn | 9 kn | 24 | 77 |
| I-201 | Japan | 1945 | 15.8 kn | 19 kn | 4 | 3 |

**Ha-201: Smallest, simplest, but revolutionary submerged speed for size**

**Why All Survived:**

**Timing:**
- Commissioned January-August 1945
- War ended August 15, 1945
- **Too late for combat deployment**
- Training incomplete
- No combat missions before surrender

**Ha-210's Timing:**
- Commissioned **same day as surrender**
- Literally never had chance to fight
- Ultimate "too late" boat

**Result:**
- 0% loss rate (not because survived combat, but because no combat)
- All scrapped 1945-1948
- Unused potential

**Technology Influence:**

**Post-War Impact:**

**US Navy:**
- Examined Ha-201-class
- Studied submerged speed design
- Influenced GUPPY conversions (1940s-1950s)
- Influenced nuclear submarine designs (high submerged speed priority)

**Soviet Navy:**
- Captured/examined Ha-201 technology
- Influenced Project 613 (Whiskey-class)
- High submerged speed emphasized

**General:**
- Showed future: Submarines should prioritize submerged performance
- Led to: Nuclear submarines (unlimited underwater power)
- Ha-201: Stepping stone to modern submarine concept

**Mass Production Plan (Failed):**

**Japan's Plan:**
- Build hundreds of Ha-201-class
- Defend home islands from invasion
- Mass coastal defense
- Cheap, simple, effective

**Reality:**
- **Only 10 completed**
- War ended before mass production
- 100+ more planned/under construction - cancelled
- Strategic concept sound but too late

**Legacy:** Ha-201-class represented revolutionary submarine technology arriving too late. Ten small boats (377 tons) with record-breaking 13 knots submerged speed - faster underwater than on surface (first in history). Electric-priority design. All commissioned January-August 1945 (war's final months). Ha-210 commissioned August 15, 1945 - same day as surrender! None saw combat. All survived war (0% loss rate - war ended). Scrapped 1945-1948. Technology influenced post-war submarine designs (US GUPPY, USSR Whiskey, nuclear submarines). Showed Japan could still innovate in 1945 but couldn't deploy fast enough. Names: Ha-201 through Ha-210 (number designations).

**Historical Significance:** Ha-201-class epitomized "too little, too late" but with revolutionary technology. First submarines faster submerged (13 knots) than surfaced (10.5 knots) - revolutionary concept, influenced entire post-war submarine development. All 10 commissioned 1945 during war's final months. Ha-210 commissioned August 15, 1945 - same day surrender - never even had one day of war service! None fought, all survived, all scrapped. Compare to Germany's Type XXI (17 knots submerged, revolutionary) - also built 1945, also too late. Japan and Germany both developing advanced submarines when war already lost. Technology excellent, timing disastrous. Ha-201 technology studied by US/USSR - influenced GUPPY conversions and early nuclear submarine thinking. Shows Japan still capable of innovation in 1945 but industrial/strategic situation hopeless. Advanced technology can't overcome strategic bankruptcy.
