**Indianapolis Killer** - I-54-class were Type B1 cruiser submarines. 3 boats commissioned 1944. Large (2,589/3,654 tons), long-range (14,000 nm). Six torpedo tubes + 17 torpedoes. I-58 sank USS Indianapolis (July 30, 1945) - 1,196 killed, worst US naval disaster at sea. I-58 only IJN sub to survive war after sinking major US warship. I-54 and I-56 lost 1945. I-58 surrendered August 1945, scuttled 1946. 67% loss rate.

**Key Specs:** 2,589/3,654 tons | 356ft | 17.7/6.5 kn | 6× 533mm tubes (17 torpedoes) + 1 floatplane | 14,000 nm range | 3 boats

**Innovation:** Type B1 cruiser submarines - large fleet boats for long-range operations. 2,589 tons surfaced, 3,654 submerged. Six torpedo tubes, seventeen torpedoes carried (good load). 140mm deck gun. One floatplane (reconnaissance). 14,000 nm range. 17.7 knots surfaced. I-58 achieved most infamous IJN submarine kill: USS Indianapolis (July 30, 1945) - heavy cruiser sinking with 1,196 deaths. Worst US naval disaster at sea. I-58 survived to surrender (only IJN sub to survive after sinking major US warship). I-54 and I-56 lost 1945. Three boats built 1944, too late to achieve strategic impact despite I-58's dramatic success.

**Design:** Large cruiser submarine hull (356 ft). Six bow torpedo tubes. Seventeen Type 95 torpedoes carried. Single 140mm (5.5-inch) deck gun forward. Two 25mm AA guns. One floatplane (removable) for reconnaissance. Diesel-electric propulsion. Two shafts. 17.7 knots surfaced, 6.5 knots submerged. Long range (14,000 nm at 16 knots). Crew 94. Standard Type B configuration - balanced fleet submarine for Pacific operations. Good weapons load, good range, adequate speed.

**July 1945: Fatal Patrol:**
*The Indianapolis Mission*

**July 16, 1945:**
- I-58 departed Kure
- **Commander:** Lieutenant Commander Mochitsura Hashimoto
- Patrol area: Philippine Sea
- Mission: Sink Allied shipping

**July 28-29, 1945:**
- Days of searching
- No targets
- Fuel/provisions declining
- Morale low

**July 30, 1945 (Just after midnight):**
**USS Indianapolis Sinking:**

**Background:**
- **USS Indianapolis (CA-35):** Heavy cruiser
- Just delivered atomic bomb components to Tinian
- Traveling alone (no escort) Guam to Leyte
- Zigzagging discontinued (believed safe waters)
- 1,196 crew aboard

**00:15 (12:15 AM), July 30, 1945:**
- I-58 surfaced to charge batteries
- Lookout spotted large ship on horizon
- **Hashimoto:** "It looks like a battleship or large cruiser!"
- Crash dive
- Approach for attack

**00:30-00:45:**
- Perfect attack position achieved
- Indianapolis silhouetted against moonlight
- Range: 1,500 meters

**00:49:**
- **Hashimoto ordered:** "Fire all six torpedoes!"
- Six Type 95 torpedoes launched
- Spread pattern toward Indianapolis

**00:50:**
- **Two torpedo hits** (possibly three)
- First hit: Bow (destroyed forward section)
- Second hit: Amidships (fuel tanks ignited)
- Massive explosions
- Indianapolis mortally wounded

**Indianapolis Death:**
- Bow blown off
- Fires throughout ship
- Flooding uncontrollable
- Power lost (no SOS sent - fatal mistake)
- **Capsized and sank in 12 minutes**
- **300 killed instantly** in explosions/sinking
- **900 entered water** (but only 317 ultimately rescued)

**The Horror:**
**July 30 - August 2, 1945 (4 days):**
- 900 men in water
- No lifeboats (sank too fast)
- Life jackets only
- Shark attacks began
- Dehydration, exposure, hypothermia
- No rescue (SOS never sent, absence not noticed)
- **Sharks killed 150-200** (estimates vary)
- Men died hourly

**August 2, 1945:**
- **Accidental discovery:** PV-1 Ventura patrol plane spotted survivors
- **Rescue operations:** Multiple ships dispatched
- **Only 317 survivors** out of 1,196 crew
- **879 killed total:**
  - 300 in sinking
  - 579 in water (sharks, exposure, drowning)
- **Worst US naval disaster at sea in history**

**I-58 Aftermath:**
- Hashimoto observed Indianapolis sink
- Remained in area briefly
- Departed safely
- Returned to Kure
- **Greatest IJN submarine success of WWII**

**August 1945: Surrender:**
- I-58 at Kure when war ended
- Surrendered intact August 15, 1945
- Hashimoto and crew survived

**Post-War:**
- **Hashimoto testified** at court-martial of Indianapolis captain (Captain McVay)
- Controversial testimony (unprecedented for enemy commander)
- McVay convicted (zigzagging failure) but later exonerated
- Hashimoto later befriended Indianapolis survivors

**1946: Disposal:**
- I-58 scuttled by US Navy April 1, 1946
- Off Goto Islands
- Sunk as target
- End of most successful IJN submarine of late war

**USS Indianapolis Controversy:**

**Why No Rescue for 4 Days:**
1. **No SOS:** Power lost instantly, no distress call sent
2. **Not missed:** Arrival at Leyte not expected/tracked
3. **Orders:** Classified mission, no one knew route
4. **Peacetime mindset:** July 1945, war winding down
5. **Accidental discovery:** Plane spotted survivors by chance

**Court-Martial:**
- Captain Charles McVay court-martialed
- Charged with: Failing to zigzag, hazarding ship
- **Hashimoto testified:** "Zigzag would not have mattered, I would have sunk her anyway"
- **Convicted** (only US Navy captain convicted for losing ship to enemy action in WWII)
- **Controversial:** Many believe scapegoat for Navy's failures
- **2000:** Exonerated by US Congress (posthumously)
- **2001:** Navy cleared McVay's record

**Loss Statistics:**
- **3 built, 2 lost (67% loss rate)**
- **Causes:**
  - Air attack: 1 boat (I-54)
  - Surface ships: 1 boat (I-56)
  - Survived: 1 boat (I-58)
- **Loss period:** January-April 1945 (4 months)
- **Total IJN casualties:** 188 submariners killed

**But I-58 inflicted:** 879 US Navy deaths (Indianapolis)

**Comparison - Type B Submarines:**
| Class | Ships | Commissioned | Torpedoes | Range | Lost | Notable |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| **I-54 (B1)** | **3** | **1944** | **17** | **14,000 nm** | **2** | **I-58 sank Indianapolis** |
| I-15 (B1) | 20 | 1940-44 | 17 | 14,000 nm | 19 | 95% loss rate |
| I-9 (B1) | 3 | 1941-43 | 17 | 16,000 nm | 3 | I-11 sank Juneau |

**I-54: Best survival rate (33%) of Type B classes**

**Why I-58 Survived:**
1. **Luck:** Avoided Allied hunters
2. **Timing:** Late commission (September 1944)
3. **Location:** Operated in less-contested areas
4. **War ended:** August 1945 (before more losses)
5. **Skill:** Hashimoto's competent command

**Commander Hashimoto Post-War:**

**Life:**
- Survived war
- Testified at McVay court-martial (1945)
- Later regretted testimony (felt used by US Navy to scapegoat McVay)
- Became Shinto priest
- **1990s:** Attended Indianapolis survivor reunions
- **Friendship:** Formed bonds with survivors
- **Statement:** "I came to ram the enemy, not shake hands. But that was 50 years ago."
- **Died:** October 25, 2000 (91 years old)

**Legacy:** I-54-class represented Type B1 cruiser submarines. Three boats built 1944. I-58 achieved most infamous IJN submarine success: Sinking USS Indianapolis (July 30, 1945) - 879 killed, worst US naval disaster at sea. Two torpedo hits sank heavy cruiser in 12 minutes. 900 men in water, sharks attacked, only 317 rescued after 4 days. I-54 and I-56 lost early 1945. I-58 only IJN submarine to survive war after sinking major US warship. Commander Hashimoto testified at controversial court-martial, later befriended survivors. I-58 scuttled 1946. Names: I-54, I-56, I-58 (number designations).

**Historical Significance:** I-54-class achieved most dramatic late-war submarine success despite tiny class size. I-58's sinking of USS Indianapolis (July 30, 1945, two weeks before surrender) became worst US naval disaster - 879 deaths from sinking, sharks, exposure over 4 days. Two torpedo hits, 12 minutes to sink, no SOS sent. Controversy: Captain McVay court-martialed (only US captain convicted for losing ship to enemy), Commander Hashimoto testified (unprecedented), McVay later exonerated (2000). Hashimoto became Shinto priest, befriended survivors in 1990s. I-58 only IJN sub to survive after sinking major US warship. I-54 and I-56 lost early 1945. Showed even late war, IJN subs could inflict catastrophic damage with luck and skill. But strategic impact zero - war already decided by July 1945.
