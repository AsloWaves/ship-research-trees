**Aircraft-Carrying Cruisers** - I-9-class were large cruiser submarines carrying floatplanes. 3 boats commissioned 1941-1942. 365 ft long, 2,919/4,149 tons. Six torpedo tubes + 5.5-inch deck gun + 1 floatplane. Long range (16,000 nm). I-10 reconnoitered Pearl Harbor before attack. I-11 contributed to sinking USS Juneau (Sullivan brothers). All 3 lost 1942-1944 (100% loss rate).

**Key Specs:** 2,919/4,149 tons | 365ft | 23.5/8 kn | 6× 533mm tubes (17 torpedoes) + 140mm gun + 1 aircraft | 3 boats

**Innovation:** Large cruiser submarines (Type A designation). Carried one Yokosuka E14Y "Glen" floatplane in watertight hangar forward of conning tower. Aircraft for reconnaissance - could scout 300+ miles from sub. Six bow torpedo tubes, 17 torpedoes carried. 5.5-inch deck gun (largest on IJN subs). Long range (16,000 nm) for distant operations. I-10 reconnoitered Pearl Harbor, Sydney Harbor before attacks. I-11 torpedoed USS Juneau after Guadalcanal battle. Showed aircraft-carrying concept worked but vulnerability high - all 3 lost.

**Design:** Large hull (365 ft). Six bow torpedo tubes. Hangar forward of conning tower for E14Y "Glen" floatplane. Catapult for launch, crane for recovery. 5.5-inch deck gun forward. Two 25mm AA guns. Long range (16,000 nm) for extended patrols. High surface speed (23.5 knots). Slow submerged (8 knots). Double-hull construction. Dive depth ~330 feet. Comfortable for long patrols. Large crew (100-114).

**Boats (3 built - all lost):**
1. **I-9** - Sunk June 13, 1943 (surface action with destroyers, off Kiska), all hands lost
2. **I-10** - Sunk July 4, 1944 (destroyer HMS Relentless, off Saipan), 1 survivor
3. **I-11** - Sunk November 10, 1943 (submarine USS Nautilus, near Tarawa), all hands lost

**Construction:**
- **I-9:** Kure Naval Arsenal, commissioned November 31, 1941
- **I-10:** Kure Naval Arsenal, commissioned July 15, 1942
- **I-11:** Kure Naval Arsenal, commissioned March 30, 1942

**Service History:**

**I-10 - Pearl Harbor Reconnaissance:**

**November 1941:**
- Assigned pre-attack reconnaissance mission
- **Launched E14Y floatplane to scout Pearl Harbor**
- Flew over Oahu November 1941 (before attack)
- Provided intelligence on US fleet disposition
- Confirmed battleships at Pearl Harbor
- Intel used for December 7 attack planning

**January-February 1942:**
- Sydney Harbor reconnaissance
- Launched floatplane to scout Sydney
- Photos used for May 1942 midget submarine attack
- Evaded Australian patrols

**1942-1944:**
- Patrols across Pacific and Indian Ocean
- Madagascar operations
- Reconnaissance missions
- Few attacks (recon primary role)

**July 4, 1944 - Sinking:**
- Off Saipan during invasion
- Detected by HMS Relentless (British destroyer)
- Depth charged extensively
- Forced to surface
- Gunfire from HMS Relentless
- **Sank with heavy damage**
- **Only 1 survivor** (rescued by British)

**I-11 - USS Juneau Incident:**

**November 13, 1942:**
- **Battle of Guadalcanal** (night action Nov 12-13)
- USS Juneau (CL-52, Atlanta-class cruiser) damaged
- Retiring with other damaged ships

**Morning of November 13:**
- I-11 was on patrol near Guadalcanal
- Detected damaged American ships
- Fired spread of torpedoes
- **One torpedo hit USS Juneau**
- **Massive magazine explosion**
- **Juneau broke in two and sank in seconds**
- **687 killed** (including all 5 Sullivan brothers)
- Only ~115 initially survived, many died before rescue
- **Final survivors: 10 men** (rescued days later)

**Significance:**
- Sullivan brothers' deaths led to "Sole Survivor Policy"
- US Navy changed policy on family members serving together
- Worst loss for one family in US military history
- I-11's most significant success

**I-11's Later Service:**
- Continued patrols through 1943
- **November 10, 1943:** Off Tarawa during invasion
- Detected by USS Nautilus (submarine)
- USS Nautilus fired torpedoes
- **I-11 sunk, all hands lost**

**I-9 - Aleutian Campaign:**

**1942-1943:**
- Operations supporting Aleutian occupation
- Supply runs to Attu and Kiska
- Reconnaissance missions
- Harsh North Pacific conditions

**June 13, 1943:**
- Off Kiska during evacuation preparations
- Detected by US destroyers USS Frazier and USS Gansevoort
- Surface action (caught on surface or forced to surface)
- **Gunfire from destroyers**
- I-9 attempted to fight back with deck gun
- Overwhelmed by destroyer firepower
- **Sank with all hands**
- No survivors

**E14Y "Glen" Floatplane Specifications:**
- **Crew:** 2 (pilot, observer)
- **Length:** 28 feet
- **Wingspan:** 36 feet
- **Speed:** 90 knots
- **Range:** 300+ miles
- **Armament:** None (pure reconnaissance)
- **Launched by catapult, recovered by crane**

**Operations:**
- Scout harbors before attacks
- Reconnaissance of enemy bases
- Weather reporting
- Communications relay
- Could not land on water in rough seas

**Loss Statistics:**
- **3 built, 3 sunk (100% loss rate)**
- **Causes:**
  - Destroyer depth charges: 1 boat (I-10)
  - Surface action with destroyers: 1 boat (I-9)
  - Submarine attack: 1 boat (I-11)
- **Loss period:** June 1943 - July 1944 (13 months)
- **Survival rate:** ~0% (only 1 survivor from I-10)

**Why 100% Loss:**
1. **Large size:** 365 ft - easier to detect
2. **Slow submerged:** 8 knots - couldn't evade
3. **Long patrols:** More exposure = more risk
4. **Aircraft operations:** Surfacing to launch/recover plane vulnerable
5. **Allied ASW improvement:** 1943-1944, Allies dominant
6. **High-value targets:** Cruiser subs priority for destruction

**140mm/40 Deck Gun:**
- Same gun as some early cruisers
- **Caliber:** 140mm (5.5 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 16,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 4-6 rounds per minute
- Largest deck gun on IJN submarines
- For surface combat against merchants

**Comparison - Aircraft-Carrying Submarines:**
| Boat | Nation | Displacement | Aircraft | Range | Fate |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| **I-9-class** | **Japan** | **2,919/4,149** | **1** | **16,000 nm** | **All sunk** |
| I-400-class | Japan | 5,223/6,560 | 3 | 37,500 nm | Survived/scuttled |
| M-class | UK | 1,594/1,950 | 1 | 5,500 nm | All sunk |

**Tactical Employment:**
**Primary Mission:** Long-range reconnaissance
- Launch floatplane to scout enemy bases
- Photo reconnaissance
- Intelligence gathering for attacks

**Secondary Missions:**
- Commerce raiding (deck gun vs merchants)
- Torpedo attacks (opportunity targets)
- Weather reporting
- Communications relay

**Limitations:**
- Aircraft operations required calm seas
- Surfacing for launch/recovery = vulnerable
- Slow submerged speed (8 knots)
- Large size = easier detection

**Sullivan Brothers Tragedy (USS Juneau):**

**Background:**
- 5 Sullivan brothers from Iowa enlisted together
- All assigned to USS Juneau (CL-52)
- George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, Albert Sullivan

**November 13, 1942:**
- Juneau damaged in night battle
- Withdrawing with task force
- **I-11 torpedo hit Juneau**
- **Magazine explosion destroyed ship instantly**
- **All 5 Sullivan brothers killed**

**Aftermath:**
- US Navy created "Sole Survivor Policy"
- Family members no longer assigned to same ship
- Movie "The Fighting Sullivans" (1944) told story
- USS The Sullivans (DD-537) named in their honor
- Changed US military policy permanently

**Legacy:** I-9-class represented IJN's aircraft-carrying cruiser submarine concept. Three boats (1941-1942) carried E14Y "Glen" floatplanes for reconnaissance. I-10 scouted Pearl Harbor and Sydney before attacks - intelligence contributed to both. I-11 torpedoed USS Juneau, killing all 5 Sullivan brothers - led to Sole Survivor Policy. All 3 lost 1942-1944 (100% loss rate). Showed aircraft-carrying concept worked but subs too vulnerable. Large size (365 ft), slow submerged (8 knots), aircraft operations exposed them. I-9 lost to destroyer surface action. I-11 lost to USS Nautilus (sub vs sub). I-10 lost to destroyer depth charges. Concept continued with larger I-400-class. Names: I-9, I-10, I-11 (sequential numbers).

**Historical Significance:** I-9-class demonstrated Japanese emphasis on long-range reconnaissance submarines. Aircraft capability unique (1941) but vulnerability high. I-10's Pearl Harbor/Sydney reconnaissance showed concept's value - accurate intelligence for attacks. I-11's sinking of USS Juneau most tragic consequence - 5 Sullivan brothers killed led to permanent US policy change. But 100% loss rate showed submarines too exposed during aircraft ops. Large size, slow submerged speed fatal against improving Allied ASW. All three lost 1943-1944 when Allied dominance peaked. Showed innovative concept (aircraft-carrying) couldn't overcome fundamental submarine vulnerabilities. I-400-class later submarines much larger with 3 aircraft but came too late. Type A discontinued after I-9-class losses.
