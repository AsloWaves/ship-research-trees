**Advanced Conventional Submarines** - Oyashio-class are refined conventional attack submarines. 11 boats commissioned 1998-2008. Last large pre-AIP class for JMSDF. Tear-drop hull design (optimized hydrodynamics). 4,000 tons submerged, 269 ft long. Diesel-electric (no AIP - predates Soryu). 6 torpedo tubes, 20 weapons (Type 89 torpedoes, Harpoon missiles). Advanced for era: Anechoic coating, improved sonar (ZQQ-5B, ZQQ-6), quiet machinery. 350-meter test depth. 20 knots submerged. Crew 70. Bridge between earlier Harushio and advanced Soryu (AIP/Li-ion). Some retired as Taigei replaces them, most still active as of 2025. Proven design serving 15-25+ years. Represented Japanese conventional submarine excellence before AIP revolution.

**Innovation:** Refined conventional submarine design (1998-2008). Last major pre-AIP class for Japan. Improved over Harushio predecessor: Larger (4,000 vs 2,750 tons), quieter (better anechoic coating, vibration isolation), better sensors. Tear-drop hull (smooth hydrodynamics, high submerged speed). Diesel-electric propulsion: 2× Kawasaki 12V 25/25 diesel generators (7,400 hp), electric motor (5,400 shp), single shaft. Lead-acid batteries (no AIP, no lithium-ion - conventional technology). 20 knots submerged (good for conventional).

- **Launched:** 1996-2007
- **Commissioned:** 1998-2008
- **Cost:** ~$400-500 million each (1990s-2000s dollars)

**Service History:**

**1998-2000s (Initial Service):**
- Oyashio commissioned March 1998 (lead boat)
- Refined conventional submarine design
- ASW training
- 11 boats commissioned over 10 years (1998-2008)
- Fleet exercises
- Patrol operations

**2000s-2010s (Operational Service):**
- ASW patrols (East China Sea, Western Pacific)
- Hunt Chinese, Russian, North Korean submarines
- Intelligence gathering
- Training exercises
- US-Japan bilateral exercises
- Very quiet (anechoic coating, good for stealth operations)

**2010s-2020s (Overlapping with Soryu):**
- Soryu-class commissioning (2009+, AIP/Li-ion, superior)
- Oyashio continue operations
- Older boats begin retiring (SS-590, SS-591 retired early 2020s)
- Newer boats (SS-596 through SS-600) remain active

**2020s (Transition to Taigei):**
- Taigei-class commissioning (2022+, lithium-ion)
- Oyashio being replaced one-for-one
- Oldest boats retired
- Mid-age boats (SS-595 through SS-600) likely remain active
- Expected: All retired by late 2020s-early 2030s as Taigei expands

**Last Pre-AIP Class:**

**Timing:**
- Oyashio: 1998-2008 (11 boats, conventional diesel-electric)
- **Soryu: 2009-2021** (12 boats, AIP/Li-ion - revolutionary)

**Oyashio Represents:**
- Peak of conventional diesel-electric technology
- Last large class before AIP
- Very capable (quiet, advanced sensors, good weapons)
- But: Must snorkel to recharge batteries (vulnerable when surfaced)

**Why No AIP:**
- Oyashio designed early 1990s (before Japan committed to AIP)
- Swedish Stirling AIP existed but not yet licensed
- Japan evaluating AIP during Oyashio construction
- Decision: Next class (Soryu) would have AIP

**Bridge Role:**
- Oyashio: Applied lessons from Harushio, very good conventional boats
- Lessons from Oyashio → Soryu design (hull shape, sensors, quieting)
- Evolutionary development (each class builds on previous)

**Tear-Drop Hull:**

**Hydrodynamic Optimization:**
- Tear-drop shape: Fat middle, tapered ends
- Minimize drag underwater
- Maximize submerged speed
- Used by most modern submarines

**Oyashio Refinement:**
- Improved over Harushio (smoother lines)
- Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) used in design
- Result: 20 knots submerged (very good for conventional)

**Anechoic Coating:**

**Stealth Technology:**
- Rubber tiles cover hull
- Absorb active sonar pings (enemy can't detect as easily)
- Reduce own noise signature (quieter)

**Oyashio Application:**
- Advanced anechoic tiles (1990s technology)
- Cover most of hull
- Significantly reduces detectability
- Critical for ASW missions (hunt subs without being detected)

**350-Meter Test Depth:**

**Deep Diving:**
- Test depth: 350 meters (1,150 feet)
- Max depth: 400+ meters estimated
- Deeper than earlier Japanese submarines (200-300 meters)

**Advantages:**
- Evade enemy ships/torpedoes (dive deeper)
- Exploit thermoclines (water temperature layers hide submarine)
- Tactical flexibility

**Not As Deep As:**
- Soryu: 650 meters (nearly 2× deeper!)
- Shows progression: Oyashio 350m → Soryu 650m

**All-Tide Names:**

**Thematic Naming:**
- All 11 boats named for tides/ocean currents (-shio = tide)
- **Oyashio:** Parent Tide (ocean current)
- **Kuroshio:** Black Tide (Kuroshio Current, major Pacific current)
- **Uzushio:** Whirlpool Tide
- **Michishio:** Current Tide
- Etc.

**Japanese Naval Tradition:**
- Tide/current names appropriate for submarines (underwater, ocean)
- Powerful natural forces (like submarines)
- Cultural significance

**11 Boats - Large Class:**

**Significant Production:**
- 11 boats over 10 years (1998-2008)
- Shows JMSDF commitment to conventional submarines
- Last large conventional class before AIP

**Why 11:**
- Fleet requirements (~20 submarines total)
- Replace older submarines (Yushio-class aging)
- Proven design (worth building multiple)
- Budget supported

**Replacement:**
- Soryu (12 boats, 2009-2021) replaced some Oyashio role
- Taigei (ongoing, 2022+) now replacing Oyashio boats
- Oldest Oyashio retired (SS-590, SS-591)
- Newest Oyashio (SS-596 through SS-600) likely serve into late 2020s

**Comparison - Japanese Conventional Submarines:**
| Class | Year | Boats | Tons (sub) | Propulsion | Depth | Weapons | Status |
|-------|------|-------|------------|------------|-------|---------|--------|
| Yushio | 1980-89 | 10 | 2,250 | Diesel-electric | 275m | 20 | Retired |
| Harushio | 1990-98 | 7 | 2,750 | Diesel-electric | 350m | 20 | Retired |
| **Oyashio** | **1998-2008** | **11** | **4,000** | **Diesel-electric** | **350m** | **20** | **Some active** |
| Soryu | 2009-21 | 12 | 4,200 | AIP/Li-ion | 650m | 30 | All active |
| Taigei | 2022+ | 5+ | 4,300 | Li-ion | 650m | 30 | Active, building |

**Oyashio: Bridge between early boats and revolutionary Soryu**

**Legacy:** Oyashio-class represented peak conventional diesel-electric submarine technology for Japan. 11 boats (1998-2008) last major pre-AIP class. Refined tear-drop hull, advanced anechoic coating, improved sensors (ZQQ-5B, ZQQ-6), 20 weapons, 350-meter depth. Quieter, more capable than predecessors (Harushio, Yushio). But: Conventional diesel-electric (must snorkel, limited submerged endurance vs later AIP). Bridge to future: Lessons learned → Soryu design (hull shape, quieting techniques, sensors). Some boats retired early 2020s (SS-590, SS-591 as Taigei enters service). Mid-age boats (SS-595 through SS-600) likely active into late 2020s. Served 15-25+ years. All-tide names (Oyashio, Kuroshio, Uzushio). Workhorses of JMSDF submarine force 1998-2020s. Oyashio-class: Excellent conventional boats, honored by long service.

**Historical Significance:** Oyashio-class marked Japan's last major conventional diesel-electric submarine class. 11 boats (1998-2008) represented refinement of technology dating to 1950s diesel-electric boats. Very capable: Advanced sensors, quiet machinery, deep diving (350m), anechoic stealth coating. But conventional technology limited: Must snorkel to recharge batteries (vulnerable when surfaced, limited endurance). Contrast with Soryu (2009+): AIP allows 2+ weeks submerged, lithium-ion provides better performance. Oyashio→Soryu transition shows JMSDF commitment to technology leadership. Oyashio served well: ASW patrols, intelligence gathering, training, 15-25 years service per boat. Being replaced by Taigei (2022+, all lithium-ion). Evolution visible: Oyashio (1998, conventional, 350m, 4,000 tons) → Soryu (2009, AIP/Li-ion, 650m, 4,200 tons) → Taigei (2022, Li-ion, 650m, 4,300 tons) = continuous improvement. Oyashio: Last of old generation, bridge to new. Honored by decades of service defending Japan.
