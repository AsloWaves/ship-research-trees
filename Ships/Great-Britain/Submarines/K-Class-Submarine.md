# K-Class Submarines (1916-1919)

## Overview
The K-class were experimental steam turbine fleet submarines, with 18 boats built 1916-1919. Designed to match battlefleet speed with steam propulsion, they were large, fast, and complex - but suffered from numerous accidents and design flaws. The class remains controversial as one of the least successful submarine designs, with 6 lost in accidents and none in combat.

## Design

**Revolutionary but Flawed:**
- Steam turbine propulsion (unique in WWI)
- Battlefleet speed (24 knots)
- Largest submarines of era
- Complex machinery
- Numerous design compromises

**Major Features:**
- Oil-fired boilers (2× oil-fired)
- Retractable funnels (for diving)
- Heavy armament (10 torpedo tubes)
- Large crew (59 men)
- Exceptional surface range (12,500 nm)

**Design Problems:**
- Slow diving time (5+ minutes)
- Complex retractable funnels
- Boiler shutdown difficult
- Poor underwater handling
- Top-heavy in rough seas

11. **K11** - 1918, lost 1918
12. **K12** - 1918, scrapped 1926
13. **K13** - 1917, sunk trials 1917, raised, renamed K22
14. **K14** - 1918, lost 1918 (Battle of May Island)
15. **K15** - 1918, sunk 1918, raised 1918
16. **K16** - 1918, scrapped 1924
17. **K17** - 1918, lost 1918 (Battle of May Island)
18. **K22** (ex-K13) - 1917/1918, lost 1924

**Cancelled:** K18-K21

## Service History

**Operational Problems:**
- Numerous accidents
- Diving difficulties
- Collision-prone
- Mechanical failures
- Poor seakeeping submerged

**Battle of May Island (January 31-February 1, 1918):**
- Night Fleet exercise disaster
- K4, K17 sunk in collisions
- K3, K6, K7 damaged
- K14 damaged, later sunk
- 105 men killed
- Worst submarine disaster in RN history

**Other Major Accidents:**
- **K13** - Sank on trials, January 1917 (32 killed)
- **K5** - Lost with all hands, Bay of Biscay, 1921
- **K15** - Sank, January 1918, raised
- **K2** - Sunk in collision, 1924

## Losses

**Catastrophic Loss Rate: 6 of 18 lost (33%), ZERO in combat:**

**Accident Losses:**
- **K13** - Sank during trials, 1917
- **K3, K4, K17** - Battle of May Island collisions, 1918
- **K5** - Lost with all hands, 1921
- **K6** - Lost in collision, 1918
- **K2** - Collision, 1924

**None Lost in Combat:**
- All losses accidental
- No combat successes
- Most dangerous to own crews
- "Kalamity K-boats"

## Post-WWI Fate

**Rapid Withdrawal:**
- Most scrapped 1921-1926
- Recognized as failures
- Never used operationally
- Expensive white elephants

## Legacy

**Design Failure:**
- Most unsuccessful RN submarine class
- Steam propulsion unsuitable
- Complex and dangerous
- Never effective

**Historical Notoriety:**
- "Kalamity K-boats" nickname
- Battle of May Island disaster
- Killed more RN than enemy sailors
- Cautionary design tale

**Operational Assessment:**
- Failed concept
- Never combat effective
- Dangerous to operate
- Abandoned post-war

**Lessons Learned:**
- Steam propulsion unsuitable for submarines
- Complexity incompatible with submarine operations
- Speed not worth complexity
- Diesel-electric proven superior
- Never repeated

**Cultural Impact:**
- Subject of books and documentaries
- "The Weary Titans of the Deep"
- Legendary failures
- Remembered as disaster class
