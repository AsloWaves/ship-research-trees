# Trafalgar-Class Nuclear Submarines (1979-1991)

## Overview
The Trafalgar-class were nuclear-powered attack submarines with 7 boats built 1979-1991. They were improved Swiftsure-class boats with enhanced sensors, quieter machinery, Tomahawk cruise missile capability, and the new PWR1 Core Z reactor. The class served successfully through the end of the Cold War and post-Cold War conflicts, being the last British SSNs before the Astute-class.
