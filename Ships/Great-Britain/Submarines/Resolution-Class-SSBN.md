# Resolution-Class Nuclear Ballistic Submarines (1964-1968)

## Overview
The Resolution-class were nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with 4 boats built 1964-1968. They were Britain's first SSBNs, providing the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent from 1969 to 1996. Armed with Polaris missiles, they represented Britain's independent strategic nuclear capability during the Cold War, maintaining continuous deterrent patrols for 27 years.

## Design

**Britain's First SSBNs:**
- Based on US Lafayette-class design
- British hull and reactor
- American Polaris missile system
- Strategic nuclear deterrent
- Continuous at-sea deterrent (CASD)

**Key Features:**
- 16 Polaris ballistic missiles
- PWR1 nuclear reactor
- Quiet operations
- Extended patrol capability
- Two-crew system (continuous availability)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Invulnerable second-strike capability
- Continuous at-sea presence
- Independent British deterrent
- Cold War strategic stability
- Minimum credible deterrent

## Boats

1. **Resolution** (S22) - 1967
2. **Repulse** (S23) - 1968
3. **Renown** (S26) - 1968
4. **Revenge** (S27) - 1969

**Crew System:**
- Each boat had TWO complete crews
- Port Crew and Starboard Crew
- Crews alternated on patrol
- 4 boats provided continuous deterrent
- Always at least one boat on patrol

## Service History

**Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (1969-1996):**
- **First Patrol**: HMS Resolution, June 1968
- **Last Patrol**: HMS Repulse, May 1996
- **27 years** of continuous deterrent patrols
- **Never missed a patrol** - always one boat at sea
- **Over 200 patrols** total
- **Perfect operational record**

**Patrol Operations:**
- 70-80 day typical patrol
- Submerged entire patrol
- Secret patrol areas (North Atlantic)
- No port visits during patrol
- Complete radio silence capability
- Independent nuclear launch authority

**Polaris Missile System:**
- **1968-1982**: Polaris A3 missiles (3× warheads per missile, 200kt each)
- **1982-1996**: Chevaline upgrade (improved penetration aids)
- **Total**: 16 missiles per boat = 48 warheads at sea
- **Range**: 2,500 nautical miles
- **Never fired in anger** (deterrence successful)

## Polaris to Chevaline

**Chevaline Upgrade (1982):**
- Improved penetration aids
- Decoys and countermeasures
- Counter Soviet ABM systems
- 2× warheads per missile (vs 3 Polaris)
- Enhanced survivability
- Secret program (not revealed until 1980)

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Maintain credible deterrent
- Counter Soviet ABM improvements
- Preserve second-strike capability
- Fill gap until Trident
- Cost-effective life extension

## Cold War Role

**Strategic Deterrent:**
- Independent British nuclear capability
- NATO strategic forces contribution
- Moscow targeting (primary)
- Invulnerable second-strike
- Political independence from US

**Operational Concept:**
- Always one boat on patrol
- Secret patrol routes
- Deep ocean operations
- Communication via VLF radio
- "Letters of Last Resort" procedures

## Retirement

**Replacement by Vanguard-class:**
- **Resolution** - Paid off 1994 (27 years)
- **Repulse** - Paid off 1996 (28 years, last patrol)
- **Renown** - Paid off 1996 (28 years)
- **Revenge** - Paid off 1992 (23 years)

**Handover to Vanguard:**
- HMS Vanguard commissioned 1993
- Overlapping operations
- Seamless transition
- Continuous deterrent maintained
- Trident replaced Polaris

## Disposal

**Decommissioning:**
- All laid up Rosyth
- Missiles removed and returned to US
- Reactors defueled
- Awaiting final disposal
- Long-term storage

## Losses

**Zero Losses:**
- All 4 boats survived service
- Perfect safety record
- No patrol failures
- Successful deterrent mission
- 27 years continuous operations

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Extraordinarily successful SSBN program
- Perfect operational record (27 years)
- Never missed deterrent patrol
- Cost-effective deterrent
- Independent British capability maintained

**Historical Significance:**
- Britain's first SSBNs
- Continuous at-sea deterrent pioneered
- Cold War strategic stability
- Independent nuclear deterrent
- Perfect operational record

**Operational Impact:**
- 27 years continuous deterrence (1969-1996)
- Over 200 deterrent patrols
- Never fired in anger (mission success)
- Cold War nuclear stability
- Seamless transition to Vanguard

**Strategic Legacy:**
- Established CASD concept
- Minimum credible deterrent model
- Two-crew system proven
- Independent deterrent validated
- Led directly to Vanguard-class

**Technical Achievements:**
- PWR1 reactor reliability
- Polaris/Chevaline integration
- Quiet operations
- 27-28 year service lives
- Zero patrol failures

**Cultural Impact:**
- "The bombers" - RN submarine tradition
- Secret deterrent patrols
- Letters of Last Resort
- Ultimate responsibility
- Cold War icon

**Quote:**
"The Resolution-class SSBNs performed their deterrent mission flawlessly for 27 years, never missing a patrol, never being detected, and - most importantly - never having to fire their weapons. That is the definition of successful deterrence."
