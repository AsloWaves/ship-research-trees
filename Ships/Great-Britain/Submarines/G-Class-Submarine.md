# G-Class Submarines (1915-1917)

## Overview
The G-class were fleet submarines with 14 boats built 1915-1917. They were enlarged E-class designs with enhanced capabilities, featuring larger size, heavier armament, and better range. The class saw extensive WWI service with moderate losses, proving the value of larger fleet submarines.

## Design

**Enlarged E-Class:**
- Larger displacement (975 vs 807 tons)
- 21-inch torpedoes vs 18-inch
- Heavier gun (3-inch vs 12-pounder)
- Better submerged endurance
- Enhanced capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Fleet submarine role
- Improved diving depth
- Better habitability
- Enhanced sensors
- Proven diesel-electric

## WWI Service

**Operations:**
- North Sea patrols
- Anti-U-boat operations
- Fleet support
- Convoy escort
- Late-war deployment

**Limited Combat:**
- Commissioned late in war
- Less combat than E-class
- Defensive operations primarily
- Some offensive patrols

## Losses

**Moderate Casualties: 4 of 14 lost (29%):**

**Operational Losses:**
- **G4** - Lost in North Sea, 1918
- **G7** - Mined North Sea, 1918
- **G8** - Mined or torpedoed, 1918
- **G11** - Lost in North Sea, 1918

**All losses 1918:**
- Late-war casualties
- Minefield operations
- Hazardous patrols

## Post-WWI Fate

**Survivors:**
- Most scrapped 1920-1921
- Some brief post-war service
- Obsolescent at armistice
- Short operational lives

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful enlarged E-class
- Proven fleet submarine
- 21-inch torpedoes standard
- Limited wartime impact (late commissioning)

**Historical Significance:**
- Bridged E-class to H-class
- Demonstrated larger boat advantages
- 21-inch torpedo adoption
- Late WWI production
