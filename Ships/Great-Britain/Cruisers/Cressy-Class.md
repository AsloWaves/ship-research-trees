# Cressy-Class Armored Cruisers (1901)

## Overview
The Cressy-class were the Royal Navy's first armored cruisers, featuring belt armor and heavy main armament. Six ships served extensively until WWI, when three were famously sunk by U-9 in a single action. They represented the Royal Navy's response to foreign armored cruiser designs, combining heavy guns with armor protection.

## Design

**First British Armored Cruisers:**
- Belt armor (6 inches)
- Heavy main armament (9.2-inch)
- Response to foreign armored cruiser threat
- Sacrificed speed for protection

**Key Features:**
- First British cruisers with side belt
- Mixed caliber armament
- Traditional pre-dreadnought layout
- Relatively low speed (21 knots)

## Ships and Fates

1. HMS Cressy - **SUNK** 1914 (U-9, North Sea)
2. HMS Aboukir - **SUNK** 1914 (U-9, North Sea)
3. HMS Hogue - **SUNK** 1914 (U-9, North Sea)
4. HMS Bacchante - Scrapped 1920
5. HMS Euryalus - Scrapped 1920
6. HMS Sutlej - Scrapped 1920

## The U-9 Disaster (September 22, 1914)

**One of Britain's Worst Naval Disasters:**
- Three Cressy-class cruisers on patrol (nicknamed "Live Bait Squadron")
- German submarine U-9 sank all three in 90 minutes
- Over 1,400 sailors lost
- Demonstrated vulnerability of old cruisers to submarines
- Led to major changes in RN doctrine

**Sequence:**
1. **0625:** HMS Aboukir torpedoed, stopped
2. **0655:** HMS Hogue approached to help, torpedoed
3. **0720:** HMS Cressy approached, torpedoed twice
4. All three sank in Broad Fourteens, North Sea

## Legacy

**Design Impact:**
- First British armored cruiser class
- Established belt armor standard
- Influenced subsequent armored cruiser designs

**Combat Lessons:**
- Obsolete by WWI standards
- Too slow to escape submarines
- Too weak to fight modern battlecruisers
- Demonstrated need for anti-submarine tactics
- Led to retirement of old cruisers from frontline

**Historical Significance:**
- Famous for U-9 disaster
- Largest single submarine victory by kills
- Changed naval tactics regarding submarine threat
