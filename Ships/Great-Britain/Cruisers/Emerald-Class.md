## Design

**High-Speed Design:**
- Built for 33 knots
- Very powerful machinery (80,000 shp)
- Light construction
- Battlecruiser fleet work

**Key Features:**
- Seven 6-inch guns
- Sixteen torpedo tubes
- Long range (8,000 nm)
- High speed emphasis

**Design Compromises:**
- Light protection
- Fragile construction
- High cost
- Specialized role

## Ships

1. **HMS Emerald** - Scrapped 1948
2. **HMS Enterprise** - Scrapped 1946

## Interwar Service

**Operations:**
- Fleet exercises
- Foreign station duty
- Training role
- Limited deployment

**Assessment:**
- Speed not fully exploited
- Expensive to operate
- Fragile construction problems
- Limited utility

## WWII Service

**Operations:**
- Convoy escort
- Trade protection
- Indian Ocean operations
- Fleet support

**Service Record:**
- Both survived WWII
- Extensive war service
- Not used in high-speed role
- Effective convoy escorts

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Expensive specialized design
- Speed not tactically useful
- Light construction problematic
- Limited value for cost

**Historical Significance:**
- Last WWI-era light cruiser design
- High-speed cruiser experiment
- Showed limits of speed emphasis
- Influenced later thinking

**Lessons Learned:**
- Pure speed not enough
- Need balance of qualities
- Protection still important
- Specialized ships have limits
