# Lion-Class Light Cruisers (Cancelled 1946)

## Overview
The Lion-class were planned large light cruisers designed during WWII as improved Minotaur-class ships. Four ships were ordered but all were cancelled in 1946 when postwar budget constraints and changing naval requirements made them unnecessary. They would have been among the largest and most powerful light cruisers ever built.

## Design Specifications (Planned)

| Characteristic | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Displacement** | 11,130 tons standard, 14,650 tons full load |
| **Dimensions** | 575 ft × 64 ft × 17.5 ft |
| **Propulsion** | 4× steam turbines, 80,000 shp |
| **Speed** | 32 knots |
| **Range** | 8,000 nmi at 13 knots |
| **Complement** | 900 |
| **Armament** | 12× 6-inch guns (4×3)<br/>12× 3-inch AA (6×2)<br/>8× 21-inch torpedoes<br/>2 aircraft |
| **Armor** | Belt: 4"<br/>Deck: 2"<br/>Turrets: 2" |

## Design

**Improved Minotaur:**
- Four triple 6-inch turrets
- Heavy AA battery
- Enhanced protection
- Large displacement

**Key Features:**
- Twelve 6-inch guns
- Powerful AA armament
- Good speed and range
- Modern fire control

**Design Philosophy:**
- Superior firepower
- Fleet flagship potential
- Trade protection
- Commonwealth service

## Planned Ships

1. **HMS Lion** - Cancelled 1946
2. **HMS Defiance** - Cancelled 1946
3. **HMS Temeraire** - Cancelled 1945
4. **HMS Thunderer** - Cancelled 1945

## Cancellation

**Reasons:**
- WWII ended
- Budget constraints
- Changing naval requirements
- Gun cruisers becoming obsolete

**Post-War Reality:**
- Missile age beginning
- Aircraft carriers priority
- Destroyers more cost-effective
- Large cruisers too expensive

## Design Evolution

**Progression:**
- Colony-class → Minotaur-class → Lion-class
- Increasing size and capability
- Improved protection each step
- More guns and better AA

**Comparison to Minotaur:**
- Larger (11,130 vs 8,885 tons)
- More guns (12 vs 9)
- Better protection (4" vs 3.5" belt)
- Higher speed (32 vs 31.5 knots)

## Alternative Fates

**What Might Have Been:**
- Commonwealth navies might have taken ships
- Could have served into 1960s-1970s
- Possible helicopter conversions
- Likely scrapped in 1950s-1960s anyway

**Comparison to Built Ships:**
- Smaller than Baltimore-class (US)
- Similar to Worcester-class (US)
- Larger than any RN light cruiser built
- Would have been impressive ships

## Legacy

**Design Impact:**
- Represented peak gun cruiser design
- Too late for gun cruiser era
- Showed changing naval thinking
- Influenced later concepts

**Historical Significance:**
- Last RN light cruiser design
- Cancelled with other ambitious wartime programs
- Represented end of traditional cruiser era
- Transition to missile age

**Might-Have-Been:**
- Would have been impressive ships
- Probably short service lives
- Gun cruisers obsolescent
- Missile age made them redundant
