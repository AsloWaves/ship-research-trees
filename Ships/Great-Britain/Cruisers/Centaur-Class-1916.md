# Centaur-Class Light Cruisers (1916)

## Overview
The Centaur-class were a two-ship subgroup of the C-class light cruisers with experimental turbine arrangements. They represented continued refinement of the successful C-class design during WWI.

- Otherwise similar to other C-class
- Small production run
- Part of C-class evolution

**Key Features:**
- Standard C-class armament
- Turbine arrangement trials
- Good performance
- Proven design

## Ships

1. **HMS Centaur** - Scrapped 1934
2. **HMS Concord** - Scrapped 1935

## WWI Service

**Operations:**
- Grand Fleet service
- North Sea patrols
- Standard light cruiser duties
- Fleet screening

**Service Record:**
- Both survived WWI
- Effective wartime service
- Long peacetime careers
- Typical C-class operations

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful C-class variant
- Turbine experiments valuable
- Good wartime performance
- Part of proven family
