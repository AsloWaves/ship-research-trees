# Minotaur-Class Conversion Proposals (Cancelled)

## Overview
Various conversion proposals existed for the incomplete Minotaur-class cruiser hulls after WWII. Plans ranged from guided missile cruisers to aircraft direction ships, helicopter cruisers, and fast minelayers. Most were too expensive and all were cancelled, with only Tiger and Blake completed as modified gun cruisers and later helicopter cruisers.

## Incomplete Ships

**Available Hulls:**
- HMS Bellerophon - Scrapped incomplete 1946
- HMS Defence - Scrapped incomplete 1946
- HMS Hawke - Scrapped incomplete 1946
- HMS Lion - Scrapped incomplete 1946
- HMS Tiger - Completed 1959 as gun cruiser
- HMS Blake - Completed 1961 as gun cruiser

## Conversion Proposals

### Guided Missile Cruiser
**Concept:**
- Seaslug area defense missile
- Remove gun armament
- Type 984 3D radar
- Modern combat information center

**Specifications:**
- Displacement: ~12,000 tons
- Armament: Seaslug, 4× 3-inch AA
- Electronics: Type 984 radar
- Cost: Very high

**Fate:** Too expensive, County-class DLG preferred

### Aircraft Direction Ship
**Concept:**
- Fighter direction center
- Large radar suite
- No main armament
- Command and control focus

**Specifications:**
- Large radar arrays
- Extensive electronics
- Minimal armament
- Command facilities

**Fate:** Cancelled, carriers assumed role

### Helicopter Cruiser (Early Proposal)
**Concept:**
- Large helicopter capacity
- ASW focus
- Some gun armament retained
- Commando carrier

**Specifications:**
- 6-8 helicopters
- Flight deck aft
- Reduced guns
- Commando facilities

**Fate:** Modified version used for Tiger and Blake 1960s conversions

### Fast Minelayer
**Concept:**
- High-speed minelaying
- Large mine capacity
- Defensive armament only
- Quick deployment

**Specifications:**
- 300+ mines
- 30+ knots
- Light AA armament
- Mine rails

**Fate:** Cancelled, mines dropped from surface ships

### Trade Protection Cruiser
**Concept:**
- Long-range patrol
- Light armament
- Extended endurance
- Colonial service

**Specifications:**
- Reduced crew
- Enhanced range
- Minimal modifications
- Economy focus

**Fate:** Too expensive for role

## Reasons for Cancellation

**Economic:**
- Post-war austerity
- High conversion costs
- New construction more economical
- Budget constraints

**Technical:**
- Aging hull designs
- Difficult modifications
- Better alternatives available
- Complex systems integration

**Strategic:**
- Changing naval requirements
- Aircraft carrier priority
- Smaller ships preferred
- Missile age arriving

## Ships Actually Completed

**HMS Tiger and HMS Blake:**
- Completed 1959 and 1961
- Modified gun cruisers
- Later converted to helicopter cruisers
- Only survivors of class

**Other Hulls:**
- Bellerophon, Defence, Hawke, Lion scrapped incomplete
- Too expensive to complete
- No viable role
- Sold for scrap 1946

## Legacy

**Design Lessons:**
- Conversions often uneconomical
- Purpose-built ships better
- Aging hulls problematic
- New construction preferred

**Historical Significance:**
- Showed end of big gun cruiser era
- Transition to specialist ships
- Economic realities of post-war RN
- Last attempts to save cruiser concept

**Influence on Later Designs:**
- Helicopter cruiser concept survived
- Guided missile ship ideas to County-class
- Showed need for new designs
- Influenced 1960s thinking

**What Became of Concepts:**
- Guided missile → County-class DLG
- Aircraft direction → Carriers took role
- Helicopter cruiser → Tiger/Blake conversions
- Fast minelayer → Concept abandoned
- Trade protection → Frigates assumed role
