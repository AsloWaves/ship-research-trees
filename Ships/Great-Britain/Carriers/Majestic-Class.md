# Majestic-Class Light Fleet Carriers (1945-1955)

## Overview
The Majestic-class were light fleet carriers with 6 ships laid down 1943-1945 as improved Colossus-class vessels. None served with the Royal Navy - all were either completed for or sold to Commonwealth navies (Australia, Canada, India). They featured improved aircraft handling, better accommodation, and enhanced defensive armament compared to their Colossus predecessors.

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful light carrier design
- Cost-effective Commonwealth capability
- Good modernization potential (3 of 6 ships)
- Served 4 decades in various navies
- Proved light carrier concept viable

**Historical Significance:**
- Enabled Commonwealth carrier aviation post-WWII
- Australian, Canadian, Indian naval aviation born on these ships
- INS Vikrant: 1971 war victory crucial
- HMAS Melbourne: Influenced Chinese carrier development
- Last generation of conventional light carriers

**Operational Impact:**
- Korean War (HMAS Sydney)
- 1971 Indo-Pakistani War (INS Vikrant)
- Vietnam War (HMAS Melbourne)
- Cold War ASW (all ships)
- Training and development (all navies)

**Design Influence:**
- Demonstrated light carrier viability
- Influenced post-war carrier thinking
- Proved angled deck retrofit value
- Showed Commonwealth naval cooperation

**Notable Events:**
- INS Vikrant - 1971 war blockade and air strikes
- HMAS Melbourne - Two collision disasters (1964, 1969)
- HMAS Sydney - Korean War patrols
- All ships - Decades of Commonwealth service

**Quote:**
"The Majestic-class carriers never served the Royal Navy that built them, but they gave Australia, Canada, and India their first taste of carrier aviation and served with distinction for four decades."
