# HMS Argus - Aircraft Carrier (1918)

## Overview
HMS Argus was the world's first aircraft carrier with a full-length flat flight deck, revolutionizing naval aviation. Converted from Italian liner Conte Rosso (construction halted by WWI), she commissioned September 1918 and pioneered flush-deck design after HMS Furious demonstrated turbulence problems. Known as "Flat Iron" for her distinctive profile with no island superstructure - bridge and funnel retractable below deck. Served WWI through WWII: training carrier (1920s-1930s), ferried aircraft to Malta (1940-1942), Operation Pedestal support, deck-landing training. Accommodation ship 1944-1946, scrapped 1947. Historic first made all future carriers possible.

## Revolutionary Design - World's First Flush-Deck Carrier

**Conversion from Liner:**
- Originally Italian liner **Conte Rosso**
- Construction suspended at WWI outbreak
- Purchased by Admiralty 20 September 1916
- Converted to aircraft carrier by William Beardmore & Company
- Launched 2 December 1917
- Commissioned 16 September 1918

**Flush-Deck Innovation:**
- **First carrier with full-length, unobstructed flight deck**
- No island superstructure
- No funnels penetrating deck
- Completely flat surface from bow to stern
- Revolutionary concept

**"Flat Iron" Nickname:**
- Named for flat-top appearance
- Pointed bow like clothes iron
- Completely flush deck
- Unique silhouette
- Instantly recognizable

**Design Evolution - Learning from HMS Furious:**
- April 1918: Modified to flush-deck configuration
- HMS Furious trials revealed severe turbulence from superstructure
- Bridge relocated below flight deck
- Pilot house retractable, centered on flight deck
- Single hangar also below deck
- Funnels exhausted horizontally through sides
- Revolutionary but created smoke/heat problems

## Technical Features

**Flight Deck:**
- **549 feet long × 68 feet wide**
- Full-length arresting gear
- Longitudinal arrestor wires
- Painted white (early experiments)
- Wooden deck with steel underneath

**Aircraft Lifts:**
- **Forward lift:** 30 ft × 36 ft
- **Aft lift:** 60 ft × 18 ft
- Two-lift system standard for future carriers
- Hydraulically operated

**Hangar:**
- 330 feet long
- 48-68 feet wide (tapered)
- 16 feet high
- Capacity: 20 aircraft
- Maintenance facilities
- Ammunition storage

**Bridge and Navigation:**
- Bridge below flight deck
- **Retractable pilot house** on flight deck
- Could be lowered during flight operations
- Innovative but impractical
- Limited visibility when retracted

**Funnel Arrangement:**
- Boiler exhaust vented horizontally through hull sides
- No vertical funnels
- Created smoke and heat problems
- Obscured flight deck in certain wind conditions
- Hot gases caused turbulence

## WWI Service (1918-1919)

**Late Commission:**
- Commissioned 16 September 1918
- Only 2 months before Armistice (11 November 1918)
- Limited WWI service
- No combat operations

**Initial Trials:**
- Deck-landing experiments
- Aircraft operations testing
- Demonstrated flush-deck viability
- Proved concept for future carriers

**Lessons Learned:**
- Flush deck worked
- No island caused navigation problems
- Horizontal funnel exhaust problematic
- Smoke obscured deck
- Future carriers needed island superstructure

## Interwar Service (1919-1939)

**Training Carrier Role:**
- Primary role: pilot deck-landing training
- Qualified generations of Fleet Air Arm pilots
- Essential for carrier pilot development
- Based at various UK ports

**Fleet Exercises:**
- Participated in naval exercises
- Demonstrated carrier capabilities
- Limited by slow speed (20.5 knots)
- Obsolete compared to newer carriers

**Mediterranean Service:**
- Some deployments to Mediterranean
- Training duties
- Show-the-flag missions

**Obsolescence:**
- By 1930s clearly obsolete
- Too slow for fleet operations
- Small aircraft capacity
- But valuable training platform

## WWII Service (1939-1944)

### Training Carrier (1939-1942)

**Initial Role:**
- Continued deck-landing training
- Essential for carrier pilot training
- Based at Scapa Flow and other UK ports
- Not intended for front-line service

### Aircraft Ferry to Malta (1940-1942)

**Desperate Shortage:**
- 1940-1942: Severe carrier shortage
- Modern carriers committed to critical operations
- Argus pressed into front-line service
- Ferry missions to Malta

**Malta Ferry Operations:**
- Transported fighters to Mediterranean
- Fly-off operations near Malta
- Hurricanes and Spitfires delivered
- Critical for Malta defense
- Multiple missions 1940-1942

**Limitations:**
- Slow speed (20.5 knots) vulnerable to submarines
- Limited defensive armament
- Old age = mechanical problems
- Required escort for safety

### Operation Pedestal (August 1942)

**Malta Relief Convoy:**
- One of largest Malta convoys
- Argus supported operation
- Loaded reserve aircraft including 6 Sea Hurricanes (804 Squadron)
- Left Clyde 2 August, arrived Gibraltar 5 August
- Three-day training exercise with other carriers
- 804 Squadron deemed not combat-ready, returned to UK aboard Argus

**Support Role:**
- Not in main convoy escort
- Reserve aircraft transport
- Training/preparation support
- Demonstrated continued utility

### Deck-Landing Training (1942-1944)

**Return to Training:**
- After repairs, returned to training role September 1944
- Qualified pilots for fleet carriers
- Essential for pilot pipeline
- Safer than risking fleet carriers

**Reclassification:**
- Reclassified as escort carrier
- Continued deck-landing training
- Based in UK waters
- Final operational role

### Accommodation Ship (December 1944)

**End of Operational Service:**
- Became accommodation ship December 1944
- Static berthing facility
- No longer seaworthy for operations
- 26 years of service

## Post-War Fate

**Listed for Disposal (mid-1946):**
- Too old for further service
- No post-war role
- Worn out by 28 years service

**Sold and Scrapped:**
- Sold 5 December 1946
- Broken up 1947
- Scrapped at Inverkeithing
- End of historic carrier

- Without Argus, carrier development delayed
- British pioneering achievement

## Comparison to Early Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Type | Speed | Aircraft | Flight Deck | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| **Argus** | UK | 1918 | Conversion (liner) | 20.5 kn | 20 | 549 ft flush | Scrapped 1947 |
| Furious | UK | 1917 | Conversion (BC) | 31.5 kn | 33 | 550 ft w/ island | Scrapped 1948 |
| Hosho | Japan | 1922 | Purpose-built | 25 kn | 21 | 525 ft w/ island | Scrapped 1947 |
| Langley | USA | 1922 | Conversion (collier) | 15.5 kn | 34 | 523 ft flush | Sunk 1942 |

**Analysis:** Argus pioneered flush-deck but island superstructure proved necessary for future designs.

## Aircraft Operated

**WWI Era (1918-1919):**
- Sopwith Pup
- Sopwith Camel
- Sopwith Cuckoo (torpedo bomber)

**Interwar (1919-1939):**
- Various training aircraft
- Fairey Flycatcher
- Hawker Nimrod
- Multiple biplane types

**WWII (1939-1944):**
- Hawker Hurricane (ferry missions)
- Supermarine Spitfire (ferry missions)
- Fairey Swordfish
- Various training aircraft

## "Flat Iron" - No Island Design

**Advantages:**
- Maximum unobstructed flight deck
- No turbulence from superstructure
- Simple, clean design
- More deck space

**Disadvantages:**
- Navigation difficult (bridge below deck)
- Command and control problems
- Smoke from horizontal funnels
- Hot exhaust gases on deck
- Limited visibility for captain

**Why Future Carriers Had Islands:**
- Captain needed clear view
- Air operations control required elevated position
- Vertical funnels cleaner
- Bridge, flight control, signals needed integration
- Island superstructure became standard
