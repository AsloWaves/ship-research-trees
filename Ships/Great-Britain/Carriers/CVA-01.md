# CVA-01 Fleet Carrier (Cancelled 1966)

## Overview
CVA-01 was a planned class of large fleet carriers designed to replace the WWII-era fleet carriers in the 1960s-1970s. The design would have been Britain's most capable carrier class, featuring angled deck, steam catapults, modern electronics, and ability to operate Phantom and Buccaneer aircraft. The class was cancelled in 1966 by the Labour government as part of defense cuts, ending Britain's fixed-wing carrier capability for 40 years until Queen Elizabeth-class.

## Cancellation

### 1966 Defence Review

**Political Context:**
- Labour government elected 1964
- Economic crisis and defence spending pressure
- "East of Suez" withdrawal policy
- Focus on NATO European commitment

**Decision:**
- **Date**: February 1966 Defence White Paper
- **Final Cancellation**: April 1966
- **Reason**: Cost (£60 million per ship), strategic priorities
- **Alternative**: Land-based air power, no carrier replacement

**Cost Estimates:**
- **Per Ship**: £60 million (1966 prices)
- **Programme**: £180 million for 3 ships
- **Through-Life**: £300+ million including aircraft and support
- **Comparison**: Equivalent to 6-8 Type 82 destroyers

### Consequences

**Immediate:**
- End of British fixed-wing carrier aviation
- Phantom and Buccaneer orders reduced
- RAF absorbed fleet air defense role
- Existing carriers run down

**Long-Term:**
- 1982 Falklands War: No fixed-wing AEW, limited strike capability
- Sea Harrier emergency procurement
- Through-deck cruisers (Invincible) built instead
- Carrier gap until Queen Elizabeth (2017)

**Strategic:**
- End of "East of Suez" role
- NATO European focus only
- Reliance on US carriers
- Reduced power projection capability

## The Great Carrier Debate

### Pro-Carrier Arguments (Royal Navy, Mountbatten)
- Essential for power projection
- Only way to provide air cover far from UK
- Falklands vindicated carrier need (1982)
- Carriers flexible, land bases vulnerable
- National prestige and capability

### Anti-Carrier Arguments (RAF, Denis Healey)
- Too expensive vs land-based aircraft
- Vulnerable to missile attack
- No Soviet fleet to fight (AAW focus)
- F-111 could do strike mission from land
- Britain withdrawing East of Suez

### The F-111 Alternative
- RAF proposed F-111K strike aircraft
- Land-based, long-range strike
- 50 aircraft ordered 1966
- Also cancelled 1968 (cost overruns)
- Neither carrier nor F-111 built

## Historical "What-If"

**If CVA-01 Had Been Built:**

**1970s:**
- Three modern carriers in service by 1977
- Phantom and Buccaneer fleet air groups
- Continued East of Suez capability
- Maintained carrier aviation expertise

**Falklands War (1982):**
- CVA-01 with Phantoms, Buccaneers, Gannet AEW
- Overwhelming air superiority
- Long-range strike capability
- Proper airborne early warning
- Easier, faster victory

**Post-Cold War:**
- Gulf War (1991): Strike capability
- Libya, Iraq interventions
- Continuous carrier presence
- No capability gap

**2000s-2020s:**
- CVA-01 class retired 1995-2005
- Replaced by Queen Elizabeth earlier (2000s?)
- Continuous carrier capability
- No 17-year fixed-wing gap

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Sound design for British requirements
- Appropriately sized (not super-carrier)
- Modern systems and capabilities
- Cost-effective for capability delivered
- Cancelled for political, not technical reasons

**Historical Significance:**
- Last British fleet carrier design
- End of RN fixed-wing carrier aviation (1966-2010)
- Most controversial defence decision of 1960s
- Vindicated by Falklands War (1982)
- Led to 40+ year carrier debate

**Alternative Path Taken:**
- Through-deck cruisers (Invincible-class)
- VSTOL Sea Harrier
- Limited fixed-wing capability
- Queen Elizabeth-class finally replaced (2010s)

**Design Influence:**
- Influenced Invincible-class (some systems)
- Informed Queen Elizabeth-class design
- Showed British carrier design capability
- Demonstrated political risk to long-term programmes

**Economic Impact:**
- Saved £180 million 1966
- Lost carrier expertise and industrial capability
- Falklands cost £1.6 billion (1982)
- Arguably false economy

**The Counterfactual:**
"If CVA-01 had been built, the Falklands War would have been won in days, not weeks, with Phantom air superiority and Buccaneer strikes overwhelming Argentine defenses before the ground war even began."

**Quote:**
"The cancellation of CVA-01 in 1966 was Britain's greatest naval mistake of the post-war era - a decision that cost the nation its carrier aviation capability for 40 years and was vindicated as wrong by the Falklands War in 1982."
