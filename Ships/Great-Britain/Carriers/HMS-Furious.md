# HMS Furious - Aircraft Carrier (1917)

## Overview
HMS Furious was originally a Courageous-class battlecruiser (completed June 1917) with two massive 18-inch guns - largest naval guns in the world. Converted through three experimental configurations (1917-1925) before emerging as first British fleet carrier with continuous full-length flight deck. First configuration (1917): forward 18-inch turret replaced with hangar/flight deck. Second (1918): aft turret also replaced, creating split deck. Final (1925): full reconstruction into proper carrier. Conducted world's first carrier air strike - Tondern Raid (19 July 1918) destroying two Zeppelins. Served through WWII: Norway operations, Tirpitz strikes, Malta ferry missions. Scrapped 1948.

## Original Battlecruiser Design

**Courageous-Class "Large Light Cruiser":**
- Designed for Fisher's Baltic Project
- Very fast (31.5 knots)
- Very lightly armored
- **2× 18-inch/40 cal guns** - world's largest naval guns!
- Built by Armstrong Whitworth, Elswick
- Laid down 8 June 1915
- Launched 15 August 1916
- Completed as battlecruiser 26 June 1917

**18-Inch Guns - Largest Ever:**
- Shell weight: 3,320 lbs
- Range: 31,400 yards
- Muzzle velocity: 2,586 fps
- Only two fitted to Furious
- Intended for shore bombardment
- Too powerful for small platform
- Recoil tremendous

**Why "Large Light Cruiser":**
- Fisher's classification to circumvent Naval Staff opposition
- Really lightly-armored battlecruiser
- Intended for Baltic operations
- Speed prioritized over protection
- Dubious tactical value

## Three Experimental Configurations

### Configuration 1: Forward Flight Deck (1917)

**First Conversion (Mid-1917):**
- Forward 18-inch turret removed
- Large hangar installed on forecastle
- **160-foot flight deck** built on hangar roof
- Aft 18-inch gun retained
- Aircraft could take off but not land

**Limitations:**
- Only forward launch capability
- No arrestor gear
- Aircraft had to ditch or land elsewhere
- Turbulence from superstructure
- Experimental only

**Aircraft:**
- 10 aircraft in forward hangar
- Sopwith Pups, Sopwith 1½ Strutters

### Configuration 2: Split Decks (March 1918)

**Second Conversion (November 1917-March 1918):**
- Aft 18-inch turret also removed
- **300-foot landing deck** installed aft
- Second hangar below aft deck
- **Split deck configuration** - narrow walkway around superstructure
- Both take-off and landing capability

**The Problem:**
- Funnel and superstructure remained in middle
- Severe turbulence between decks
- Landing very dangerous
- Several fatal crashes
- Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning killed attempting landing
- Configuration proved unworkable

**First Carrier Strike - Tondern Raid (19 July 1918):**
- Despite limitations, Furious launched historic attack
- 7× Sopwith Camels took off from forward deck
- Attacked Zeppelin sheds at Tondern, Germany
- **Destroyed 2 Zeppelins** (L.54 and L.60)
- **World's first carrier air strike**
- Demonstrated carrier potential
- Aircraft could not return (ditched or landed in Denmark)

### Configuration 3: Full-Length Flight Deck (1921-1925)

**Major Reconstruction (June 1921-September 1925):**
- Complete rebuild as proper aircraft carrier
- **Continuous 576-foot flight deck**
- Superstructure moved starboard (island)
- Funnels angled out to starboard
- Two hangars
- Two aircraft lifts
- Arrestor gear fitted
- Proper carrier finally realized

**Final Design:**
- Similar to contemporary HMS Hermes and Eagle
- 33-36 aircraft capacity
- Two lifts (forward and aft)
- Island superstructure starboard side
- Longitudinal arrestor wires
- Modern carrier operations possible

## WWI Service (1917-1918)

**Battlecruiser Operations (June-August 1917):**
- Brief service with 18-inch guns
- Gunnery trials
- North Sea patrols
- Impractical design

**First Carrier Configuration (August 1917-Early 1918):**
- Experimental aircraft operations
- Take-off trials
- No landing capability
- Limited utility

**Tondern Raid (19 July 1918):**
- **World's first carrier air strike**
- 7× Sopwith Camels launched
- Attacked German Zeppelin base
- 2 Zeppelins destroyed in sheds
- Proved carrier concept
- Historic achievement

**Significance:**
- Demonstrated carriers could strike enemy territory
- Airpower from sea validated
- Changed naval warfare permanently

## Interwar Service (1919-1939)

**Reconstruction Period (1921-1925):**
- Out of service for 4+ years
- Complete rebuild
- Emerged as modern carrier

**Fleet Carrier Service (1925-1939):**
- Home Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet
- Fleet exercises
- Development of carrier doctrine
- Training platform
- Naval aviation pioneering

**Aircraft Operated:**
- Fairey Flycatcher fighters
- Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers
- Fairey IIIF reconnaissance
- Various biplane types

## WWII Service (1939-1945)

### Norwegian Campaign (1940)

**April-June 1940:**
- Air support for British troops ashore
- Attacked German shipping
- Cover for evacuations
- Demonstrated carrier utility in littoral operations

### Mediterranean Operations (1940-1942)

**Malta Ferry Missions:**
- Critical role delivering fighters to Malta
- **April 1941:** 24× Hurricanes to Gibraltar
- **May 1941:** 40× Hurricane IIs delivered
- **June 1941:** 48× Hurricane IIs delivered
- Multiple ferry runs 1940-1942
- Desperate times required old carrier

**Limitations:**
- Slow by WWII standards (31.5 knots barely adequate)
- Vulnerable to air attack
- Small aircraft capacity vs modern carriers
- Required escort

### Arctic Operations (1941-1942)

**Petsamo/Kirkenes Strike (July 1941):**
- Attacked German forces in northern Norway
- 24 aircraft launched
- Found Petsamo harbor mostly empty
- Claimed small steamer sunk
- Demonstrated Arctic capability

**Convoy Escorts:**
- Arctic convoy protection
- Limited by slow speed for 1940s
- Air cover for convoys
- Anti-submarine patrols

### Operation Tungsten (April 1944)

**Attack on Tirpitz:**
- Participated in strike on German battleship
- Launched aircraft against Tirpitz in Kaafjord
- Hit Tirpitz with bombs
- Part of multi-carrier strike
- Final major operation for Furious

### Training and Reserve (1944-1945)

**September 1944:**
- Placed in reserve
- Too old for front-line service
- Worn out by 27 years

**April 1945:**
- Decommissioned
- End of operational career
- Awaited scrapping

## Post-War Disposal

**Sold for Scrap:**
- January 1948: Sold to BISCO
- March 15, 1948: Scrapping began
- **July 1948:** Hull broken up at Troon
- End of historic ship

## Legacy

**Pioneer of Carrier Aviation:**
- First British ship with take-off deck
- First carrier to launch air strike (Tondern 1918)
- Proved carrier concept viable
- Experimental configurations advanced knowledge
- Split-deck configuration failed but taught lessons

**Tondern Raid - Historic First:**
- **19 July 1918:** World's first carrier strike
- 2 Zeppelins destroyed
- Validated carrier concept
- Changed naval warfare
- Demonstrated strategic reach

**Design Evolution:**
- Three configurations showed development of carrier design
- Split-deck failure led to full-length decks
- Island superstructure proved necessary
- Lessons applied to all future carriers

**Longest Service:**
- 31 years (1917-1948)
- Served both World Wars
- Battlecruiser to pioneering carrier
- Remarkable transformation

**WWII Contribution:**
- Malta ferry missions critical
- Norway and Arctic operations
- Tirpitz strikes
- Old ship served bravely

## Comparison - Three Configurations

| Configuration | Period | Flight Deck | Funnels | Aircraft | Capability |
|---------------|--------|-------------|---------|----------|------------|
| **1: Forward Deck** | 1917 | 160 ft forward | Amidships | 10 | Take-off only |
| **2: Split Decks** | 1918 | 160 ft + 300 ft | Amidships | 20 | Launch/land but dangerous |
| **3: Full Deck** | 1925-1948 | 576 ft continuous | Island starboard | 33-36 | Full carrier operations |

**Analysis:** Evolution from experiment to practical carrier demonstrated learning process.

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Type | Speed | Aircraft | Flight Deck | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| **Furious** | UK | 1917/1925 | Conversion (BC) | 31.5 kn | 33-36 | 576 ft w/ island | Scrapped 1948 |
| Argus | UK | 1918 | Conversion (liner) | 20.5 kn | 20 | 549 ft flush | Scrapped 1947 |
| Hermes | UK | 1924 | Purpose-built | 25 kn | 20 | 570 ft w/ island | Sunk 1942 |
| Hosho | Japan | 1922 | Purpose-built | 25 kn | 21 | 525 ft w/ island | Scrapped 1947 |

**Analysis:** Furious fastest of early carriers due to battlecruiser origins, but experimental nature limited effectiveness.
