# Ruler-Class Escort Carriers (1943-1944)

## Overview
The Ruler-class were escort carriers with 31 ships transferred to the Royal Navy 1943-1944 under the Lend-Lease program, making it the largest carrier class in RN service. Based on the US Bogue-class design like the earlier Attacker-class, they provided crucial convoy escort, anti-submarine warfare, and amphibious support throughout WWII. They served in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific theaters.

- Few converted to merchant ships

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Most numerous RN carrier class (31 ships)
- Successful Lend-Lease programme
- Proved escort carrier concept essential
- Cost-effective convoy protection
- Closed mid-Atlantic air gap

**Historical Significance:**
- Largest single carrier class RN operated
- Critical Atlantic convoy protection 1943-1945
- Enabled Mediterranean amphibious operations
- Supported British Pacific Fleet 1944-1945
- Demonstrated Allied cooperation

**Operational Impact:**
- **Atlantic**: Convoy protection, U-boat suppression
- **Mediterranean**: Amphibious support, ground attack
- **Indian Ocean**: Fleet escort, ASW patrols
- **Pacific**: British Pacific Fleet support
- **Arctic**: Russian convoy escort

**Statistical Achievement:**
- 31 ships operated
- Thousands of convoy escort missions
- Hundreds of U-boat contacts
- Multiple U-boat kills
- 30 of 31 survived the war (96.7% survival rate)

**Design Influence:**
- Validated escort carrier concept
- Showed mass production viability
- Proved merchant conversion success
- Demonstrated Lend-Lease effectiveness
- Influenced post-war light carrier thinking

**Notable Quote:**
"Thirty-one Ruler-class carriers - the largest carrier class the Royal Navy ever operated - closed the Atlantic air gap, protected countless convoys, and proved that quantity has a quality all its own."
