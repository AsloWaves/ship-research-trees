# King George V-Class Battleships (1940)

## Overview
The King George V-class were the Royal Navy's most modern battleships during World War II, built under Second London Naval Treaty restrictions (14-inch guns). Five ships served extensively in Atlantic and Pacific operations, including the sinking of Bismarck (King George V), loss of Prince of Wales to Japanese aircraft (1941), and Pacific theater operations (1945). The unusual quadruple turret design and 14-inch guns were controversial but effective.
