# HMS Vanguard - Last British Battleship (1946)

## Overview
HMS Vanguard was the last battleship built by the Royal Navy and the final battleship ever built by any nation. Completed in 1946 after WWII ended, she combined modern hull design and fire control with recycled 15-inch guns from WWI battlecruisers. The largest, fastest, and most advanced British battleship ever built, Vanguard served as flagship and royal yacht but saw no combat. She was decommissioned in 1960 and scrapped in 1962 - the last battleship anywhere.

## Design and Construction

**Origins (1939-1941):**
- Designed as fast battleship under 1941 War Programme
- Intended to counter Japanese Yamato-class
- Used spare 15-inch guns from cancelled WWI battlecruisers (Courageous, Glorious, Furious converted to carriers)

**Recycled Armament:**
- 8× BL 15-inch/42 Mk I guns built 1914-1916
- Originally mounted on Courageous-class battlecruisers
- Removed when those ships converted to aircraft carriers (1924-1928)
- Stored for 15+ years, refurbished for Vanguard
- Reason: New 16-inch guns would delay completion by 2+ years

**Build Details:**
- Built: John Brown & Co., Clydebank
- Laid down: 2 October 1941
- Launched: 30 November 1944
- Completed: **12 May 1946** (WWII already over)
- Commissioned: 12 August 1946
- Cost: £9,000,000

**Modern Features:**
- Most advanced fire control (director and radar)
- Best subdivision and damage control
- Excellent seakeeping
- Strong AA armament (16× 5.25-inch DP)
- Improved armor scheme (6-inch deck vs 3" on Hood)

## Service History

### Post-WWII Royal Navy (1946-1960)

**1946-1947: Trials and Shakedown**
- Sea trials July 1946: Achieved 31.57 knots (exceeded design speed)
- Most powerful and fastest British battleship ever

**1947: Royal Tour of South Africa**
- First major mission: Royal yacht for King George VI and family
- Conveyed Royal Family to South Africa (February-May 1947)
- Demonstrated British prestige in peacetime role

**1947-1959: Flagship and Training**
- Home Fleet flagship
- Mediterranean Fleet
- Training ship for cadets
- Goodwill visits
- Fleet exercises

**1949: Mediterranean Crisis**
- Deployed during tensions but saw no combat

**1950s: Modernization Considered**
- Plans for guided missile conversion (never executed)
- Too expensive in peacetime
- Aircraft carriers considered more important

**1960: Decommissioned**
- Placed in reserve 1 August 1960
- No combat service in 14-year career
- Most powerful battleship never to fire shot in anger

### Scrapping (1960-1962)

**Disposal:**
- Decommissioned: 1 August 1960
- Sold to BISCO: £560,000 (less than 7% of build cost)
- Arrived breakers: 1962
- **Last battleship in world scrapped**

## Legacy and Significance

**"Last Battleship":**
- Last battleship built anywhere in world
- Last battleship commissioned (UK, 1946)
- Last battleship scrapped (UK, 1962)
- End of battleship era

**Technical Achievement:**
- Largest British battleship (51,420 tons full load)
- Fastest British battleship (31.57 knots)
- Most advanced British battleship (fire control, subdivision, radar)
- Best protected (6-inch deck armor)

**Paradox:**
- Most advanced British battleship
- Never fired shot in anger
- Obsolete before completion (WWII ended)
- Aircraft carriers rendered battleships obsolete

**What If:**
If completed in 1944 as planned:
- Would have served in Pacific against Japan
- 15-inch guns effective against Japanese ships
- High speed (30+ knots) useful for carrier escorts
- Would have been valuable addition to British Pacific Fleet

**Why Never Saw Combat:**
- Completed August 1946 (11 months after WWII ended)
- Cold War: No major naval surface actions
- UK could not afford to operate battleships and carriers
- Aircraft carriers prioritized over battleships

## Comparison to Final Battleships

### Last Battleships of Major Navies

| Ship | Nation | Commissioned | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Fate |
|------|--------|--------------|--------------|-------|-----------|------|
| **HMS Vanguard** | UK | 1946 | 51,420 tons | 31.57 kn | 8× 15" | Scrapped 1962 |
| USS Wisconsin | USA | 1944 | 57,540 tons | 33 kn | 9× 16" | Museum ship 2006 |
| Jean Bart | France | 1955 | 48,950 tons | 32 kn | 8× 15" | Scrapped 1970 |
| Yamato | Japan | 1941 | 72,800 tons | 27 kn | 9× 18.1" | Sunk 1945 |

### Vanguard vs Earlier British Battleships

| Ship | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Deck Armor | Combat Service |
|------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Vanguard** | 1946 | 51,420 tons | 31.57 kn | 8× 15" | 6" | **None** |
| Hood | 1920 | 46,680 tons | 31 kn | 8× 15" | 3" | Sunk 1941 |
| King George V | 1940 | 42,245 tons | 28 kn | 10× 14" | 6" | Extensive WWII |
| Nelson | 1927 | 38,000 tons | 23 kn | 9× 16" | 6.25" | Extensive WWII |

**Analysis:** Vanguard was largest, fastest, best-protected - but never saw combat.

## Technical Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Speed:** 31.57 knots (fastest British battleship)
2. **Size:** 51,420 tons (largest British battleship)
3. **Protection:** Best armor scheme (6-inch deck - learned from Hood)
4. **Fire Control:** Most advanced radar and directors
5. **Seakeeping:** Excellent in rough seas
6. **AA Defense:** Strong 5.25-inch DP battery

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Armament:** 15-inch guns less powerful than 16-inch (Nelson) or foreign 16-18-inch
2. **Old Guns:** 30-year-old recycled guns (though refurbished)
3. **Timing:** Completed after WWII, obsolete immediately
4. **Cost:** Expensive to operate in peacetime
5. **Role:** No clear mission in post-WWII world

**Comparison to Hood (Same Guns):**
- Vanguard: 6-inch deck armor (survived plunging fire)
- Hood: 3-inch deck armor (fatal weakness)
- Vanguard corrected Hood's fatal flaw

## Conclusions

HMS Vanguard was the magnificent final statement of the battleship era - the largest, fastest, and most advanced British battleship ever built, yet she never fired a shot in anger. Completed after the war that justified her construction, Vanguard served as a symbol of British naval power in a world where aircraft carriers had replaced battleships as the capital ships of the fleet.

**Key Points:**
1. **Last battleship ever built** (anywhere in world)
2. **Largest British battleship** (51,420 tons)
3. **Fastest British battleship** (31.57 knots)
4. **Most advanced British battleship** (fire control, protection, radar)
5. **Recycled guns** - 30-year-old 15-inch guns from WWI battlecruisers
6. **No combat** - served 1946-1960 entirely in peacetime
7. **Royal yacht** - conveyed King George VI to South Africa (1947)
8. **Scrapped 1962** - last battleship anywhere to be scrapped

Vanguard represents both the pinnacle and the end of the battleship: a magnificent, obsolete anachronism. The battleship era had ended, and Vanguard was its last, greatest expression - a ship without a war.
