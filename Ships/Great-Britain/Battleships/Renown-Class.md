# Renown-Class Battlecruisers (1916)

## Overview
The Renown-class were two fast battlecruisers built during WWI featuring 6× 15-inch guns and 32-knot speed but thin armor. Both were extensively reconstructed twice between the wars, with HMS Renown receiving the most thorough modernization (1936-1939). HMS Renown survived WWII with distinction, but HMS Repulse was sunk alongside HMS Prince of Wales by Japanese aircraft in December 1941, demonstrating battleship vulnerability to air power.

## Design & Construction

**Original Design (1916):**
- Designed as fast battlecruisers for WWI
- 6× 15-inch guns (2 forward, 1 aft)
- 32 knots speed
- **Thin armor** (6-inch belt originally)
- Cost: ~£3 million each

**Fastest Capital Ships:**
- World's fastest capital ships when commissioned
- Built in 15 months (rapid wartime construction)
- Completed August-September 1916 (after Jutland)

## Reconstructions

**1920s Reconstruction (Both Ships):**
- Increased armor (belt to 9 inches)
- Improved deck armor
- Updated fire control
- Minor improvements

**1930s Major Reconstruction (Renown only, 1936-1939):**
- Completely rebuilt
- Deck armor increased to 5 inches
- New superstructure
- Modern AA battery (20× 4.5-inch DP)
- Aircraft catapult
- Modern fire control and radar
- Cost: £3 million (as much as original build)
- **Most thoroughly modernized British capital ship**

**Repulse:**
- Received only 1920s reconstruction
- Less armor than Renown
- Less capable AA armament
- Fatal vulnerability in 1941

## Ships of the Class

### 1. HMS Renown (72)
- **Built:** Fairfield, 1915-1916
- **Commissioned:** 20 September 1916
- **Major Reconstruction:** 1936-1939 (most thorough)
- **Service:** WWI Grand Fleet, WWII Atlantic/Mediterranean/Indian Ocean
- **Fate:** Scrapped 1948

### 2. HMS Repulse (34)
- **Built:** John Brown, 1915-1916
- **Commissioned:** 18 August 1916
- **Reconstruction:** 1920s only (less extensive)
- **Service:** WWI Grand Fleet, WWII Atlantic/Far East
- **Fate:** **SUNK** 10 December 1941 by Japanese aircraft (Force Z)

## WWII Service

### HMS Renown

**1939-1940: Atlantic & Norway:**
- Hunted Admiral Graf Spee (1939)
- Norway Campaign (April 1940)
- **Engaged Scharnhorst & Gneisenau (9 April 1940)** - damaged Gneisenau

**1940-1941: Force H (Gibraltar):**
- Mediterranean operations
- Malta convoys
- Bombardment of Genoa (February 1941)
- Hunted Bismarck (1941)

**1942-1945: Indian Ocean:**
- Eastern Fleet operations
- Contained Japanese in East Indies
- Survived entire war

### HMS Repulse

**1939-1941: Atlantic Operations:**
- Hunted Graf Spee
- Norway Campaign
- Atlantic patrols
- Home Fleet operations

**Force Z - Singapore (November-December 1941):**
- Sent to Singapore with HMS Prince of Wales
- Churchill's attempt to deter Japan
- No air cover available

**Sinking - 10 December 1941:**
- **Location:** South China Sea off Kuantan, Malaya
- **Attackers:** Japanese land-based bombers/torpedo bombers
- **Hits:** Multiple torpedoes and bombs
- **Sank:** With 513 crew (508 rescued)
- **With:** HMS Prince of Wales also sunk
- **Significance:** First modern capital ships sunk by aircraft while underway
- **Lesson:** Battleships vulnerable to air power without air cover

## Force Z Disaster

**Background:**
- Churchill sent Prince of Wales & Repulse to deter Japan
- No aircraft carrier available (Indomitable damaged)
- Based at Singapore

**10 December 1941:**
- Force Z (Prince of Wales, Repulse, 4 destroyers) at sea
- Attacked by Japanese bombers from Indochina
- No fighter cover
- Repulse: Hit by 1 bomb, 5 torpedoes
- Prince of Wales: Hit by 6 torpedoes, 1 bomb
- Both sunk in 2 hours
- 840+ crew lost total

**Impact:**
- Proved battleships needed air cover
- End of battleship supremacy
- Aircraft carriers became capital ships
- Singapore fell February 1942

## Legacy

**HMS Renown:**
- Most successful British battlecruiser of WWII
- Survived entire war
- Excellent post-reconstruction performance
- Demonstrated value of thorough modernization

**HMS Repulse:**
- Less modernized, more vulnerable
- Tragic loss demonstrated air power
- Symbol of battleship obsolescence
- Name continued with Polaris submarine (1968)

**Design Assessment:**
- Fast (32 knots) but lightly armored
- Renown's reconstruction successful
- Repulse's limited reconstruction insufficient
- Both demonstrated battlecruiser vulnerabilities

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Ship | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Belt | Deck | Fate |
|------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------|------|------|
| **Renown** | 1916/39 | 36,080 tons | 32 kn | 6× 15" | 9" | 5" | Survived |
| **Repulse** | 1916/24 | 32,000 tons | 32 kn | 6× 15" | 6" | 3" | Sunk 1941 |
| Hood | 1920 | 46,680 tons | 31 kn | 8× 15" | 12" | 3" | Sunk 1941 |
| Scharnhorst | 1939 | 38,900 tons | 32 kn | 9× 11" | 13.8" | 4.1" | Sunk 1943 |

**Analysis:** Renown's 1930s reconstruction made her more survivable than Repulse or Hood.
