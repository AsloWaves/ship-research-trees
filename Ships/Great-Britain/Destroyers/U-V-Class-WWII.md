# U & V-Class Destroyers (1942-1943)

## Overview
The U and V-classes were War Emergency Programme destroyers with 16 ships built 1942-1943 (8 per class). Continuing the successful O/P/Q/R/S/T design lineage, they were among the last conventional fleet destroyers built during WWII. The class saw extensive Pacific and European service with low losses and many served into the 1970s.
