# Ambuscade-Type Prototype Destroyer (1926)

## Overview
HMS Ambuscade was a single prototype destroyer built by Yarrow 1926 as an experimental design preceding the standard A-class. She tested advanced features including superheated steam, experimental hull form, and improved armament layout that influenced subsequent destroyer design.

## Design Features

**Experimental Technologies:**
- Yarrow superheated steam (higher efficiency)
- Advanced hull form (higher speed)
- Improved bridge layout
- Enhanced crew accommodation

**Key Innovations:**
- 37-knot design speed (fastest British destroyer 1926)
- Quad torpedo mounts (8 tubes total)
- Improved fire control positions
- Better seakeeping than predecessors

## Service History

**Peacetime (1926-1939):**
- Fleet exercises and trials
- Tested various equipment
- Mediterranean Fleet service
- Home Fleet operations

**WWII (1939-1945):**
- Convoy escort Atlantic
- Dover Patrol duties
- Channel operations
- North Sea patrols
- Survived the war

**Post-War:**
- Paid off 1946
- Scrapped 1947

## Legacy

**Design Influence:**
- Informed A-class standard design
- Validated superheated steam
- Proved quad torpedo mounts
- Influenced subsequent destroyers
- Yarrow design expertise demonstrated

**Comparison to Amazon:**
- Ambuscade: Yarrow design, 37 knots
- Amazon: Thornycroft design, 37.5 knots
- Both prototypes for A-class
- Different technical approaches
