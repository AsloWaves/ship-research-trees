# Amazon-Type Prototype Destroyer (1926)

## Overview
HMS Amazon was a single prototype destroyer built by Thornycroft 1926 as an experimental design preceding the standard A-class. She tested advanced features including high-pressure boilers, experimental machinery arrangement, and improved performance that influenced subsequent destroyer design.

## Design Features

**Experimental Technologies:**
- Thornycroft high-pressure boilers
- Advanced machinery layout
- Streamlined hull form
- Improved weight distribution

**Key Innovations:**
- 37.5-knot achieved speed (fastest 1926)
- Efficient boiler arrangement
- Better fuel economy than Ambuscade
- Enhanced bridge and fire control

## Service History

**Peacetime (1926-1939):**
- Fleet trials and exercises
- Mediterranean Fleet
- Home Fleet service
- Equipment testing platform

**WWII (1939-1945):**
- Atlantic convoy escort
- Western Approaches Command
- Channel operations
- Anti-submarine patrols
- Survived the war

**Post-War:**
- Paid off 1948
- Scrapped 1948

## Legacy

**Design Influence:**
- Informed A-class standard design
- Validated high-pressure boilers
- Proved Thornycroft design concepts
- Influenced interwar destroyer development
- Speed and efficiency benchmark

**Comparison to Ambuscade:**
- Amazon: Thornycroft, slightly faster
- Amazon: Heavier displacement
- Amazon: Better fuel economy
- Both informed standard A-class
