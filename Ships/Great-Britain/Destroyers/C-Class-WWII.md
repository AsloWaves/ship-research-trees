# C-Class Destroyers (1943-1946)

## Overview
The C-class were late War Emergency Programme destroyers with 32 ships built 1943-1946 in four sub-groups (Ca, Ch, Co, Cr). They were enlarged War Emergency destroyers with improved capabilities, representing a transition toward post-war Battle-class design. Many saw Korean War and Cold War service extending into the 1970s.

**Peacetime Losses: 2 of 32 lost (6.25%)**

**Major Losses:**
- HMS Chequers - Mined, 1946
- HMS Cheviot - Grounded, 1949 (constructive total loss)

**Exceptional Survival:**
- Late commissioning protected class
- Most served into 1960s-1970s
- Very low loss rate
- Long peacetime careers

## Post-War Modernization

**Type 15 Conversions:**
