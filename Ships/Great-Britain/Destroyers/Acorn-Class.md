# Acorn-Class Destroyers (H-Class) (1910)

## Overview
The Acorn-class (H-Class) were the first "standard" destroyers, with 20 identical ships built 1910-1911. They established the destroyer configuration that would dominate through WWI, introducing the 4-inch gun as main armament and standardizing oil firing. The class marked the transition from experimental designs to mass-produced standard types.
