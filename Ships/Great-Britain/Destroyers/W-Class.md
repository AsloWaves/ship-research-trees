# W-Class Destroyers (1918)

## Overview
The W-class were near-identical sisters to the V-class, with 39 ships built 1918-1919. Together with the V-class, they formed the legendary V&W classes (67 ships total) that served from WWI through WWII and were considered the finest destroyers of their generation. The W-class had slightly refined details but shared the revolutionary V-class design.
