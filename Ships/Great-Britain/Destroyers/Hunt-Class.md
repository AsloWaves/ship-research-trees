# Hunt-Class Escort Destroyers (1939-1943)

## Overview
The Hunt-class were specialized escort destroyers built 1939-1943, with 86 ships in four types (I-IV). Designed for convoy escort and ASW duties with heavy AA armament, they sacrificed speed and torpedo armament for anti-submarine and anti-aircraft capability. The class proved highly effective in convoy protection, Mediterranean operations, and coastal warfare throughout WWII.

## Design Evolution

**Type I (20 ships, 1940-1941):**
- 4× 4-inch AA guns (2 twin mounts)
- No torpedo tubes
- Heavy AA focus
- Proved top-heavy

**Type II (36 ships, 1941-1942):**
- 6× 4-inch AA guns (3 twin mounts)
- 3× 21-inch torpedo tubes
- Improved stability
- Most numerous variant

**Type III (28 ships, 1942-1943):**
- 4× 4-inch AA guns (2 twin mounts)
- 2× 21-inch torpedo tubes
- Better balanced design
- Enhanced ASW equipment

**Type IV (2 ships, 1943):**
- 6× 4-inch AA guns (3 twin mounts)
- 3× 21-inch torpedo tubes
- Improved machinery
- Limited production

## WWII Service

**Major Operations:**
- Atlantic convoy escort
- Mediterranean campaigns
- Malta convoys
- North Africa landings
- Channel operations
- D-Day support

**Notable Actions:**
- HMS Quorn - D-Day operations
- HMS Brecon - Mediterranean service
- HMS Atherstone - Channel actions
- Extensive convoy protection

## Losses

**Moderate Casualties: 23 of 86 lost (27%)**

**Major Losses:**
- HMS Berkeley - Dieppe Raid, 1942
- HMS Quorn - Mined, 1944
- HMS Rockwood - Bombed, 1944
- HMS Limbourne - Torpedoed, 1943
- HMS Dulverton - Bombed Mediterranean, 1943

**Mediterranean Toll:**
- Heavy losses in Mediterranean theater
- Mine and air attack casualties
- Several lost supporting amphibious operations

## Post-WWII Fates

**Transfers:**
- Several to Royal Norwegian Navy
- Several to Royal Indian Navy
- Several to Egyptian Navy
- Extended foreign service

**Survivors:**
- Most scrapped 1945-1956
- Some continued with foreign navies
- None preserved
- Successful convoy escort role

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Excellent convoy escorts
- Heavy AA armament effective
- Sacrificed speed for capability
- Proved design soundness

**Historical Significance:**
- Critical convoy protection
- 86 ships largest escort class
- Successful specialized design
- Mediterranean workhorses

**Operational Impact:**
- Essential Atlantic convoys
- Malta convoy lifeline
- D-Day support crucial
- ASW/AA balance effective
