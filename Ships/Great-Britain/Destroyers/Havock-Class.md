# Havock-Class Torpedo Boat Destroyers (1893)

## Overview
HMS Havock and HMS Hornet were the world's first torpedo boat destroyers, laid down in 1893 by Yarrow. They introduced the "destroyer" concept - fast vessels designed to destroy enemy torpedo boats while carrying their own torpedoes. These revolutionary ships established the destroyer as a distinct warship type.
