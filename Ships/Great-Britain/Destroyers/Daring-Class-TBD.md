# Daring-Class Torpedo Boat Destroyers (1893)

## Overview
HMS Daring and HMS Decoy were among the first torpedo boat destroyers, built by Thornycroft in 1893. They competed directly with the Havock-class for the title of "first destroyer" and featured Thornycroft's alternative design approach with slightly different characteristics but the same 26-knot speed requirement.

## Design

**Thornycroft Approach:**
- Slightly larger than Havock-class
- More powerful engines (4,200 vs 3,500 ihp)
- Heavier gun armament (5 vs 3× 6-pounders)
- Four funnels vs three on Havock

**Key Features:**
- Thornycroft water-tube boilers
- Raised forecastle
- Four-funnel arrangement
- Enhanced armament

**Design Philosophy:**
- Emphasis on firepower
- Slightly larger for seaworthiness
- Alternative destroyer concept
- Competitive with Yarrow design
