# V-Class Destroyers (1917)

## Overview
The V-class were revolutionary destroyers that broke from the alphabet-class formula with increased size, heavier armament (four 4-inch guns), and superior speed. Together with the W-class, they formed the famous V&W classes - 67 ships total that were considered the finest destroyers of their era and served into WWII.
