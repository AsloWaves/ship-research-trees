# Modified W-Class Destroyers (1919)

## Overview
The Modified W-class (also known as W-class Repeat or Admiralty Modified W) were enhanced V&W-class destroyers with improved armament and fire control. Only 7 ships were completed from 16 ordered, as most were cancelled at the Armistice. They featured enhanced 4.7-inch guns and represented the ultimate evolution of the V&W design.
