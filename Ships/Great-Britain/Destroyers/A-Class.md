# A-Class Destroyers (1928)

## Overview
The A-class (also known as Amazon-class or Prototype Flotilla) were the first destroyers of the interwar alphabetical flotilla system, with 9 ships built 1927-1929. They introduced the 4.7-inch gun as standard armament, established the flotilla leader concept with Amazon, and pioneered the systematic naming convention that would continue through the I-class.
