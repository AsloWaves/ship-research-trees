# Tribal-Class Destroyers (F-Class) (1907)

## Overview
The Tribal-class (F-Class) were large, powerful destroyers that introduced oil fuel to Royal Navy destroyers and featured unprecedented armament. With 13 ships built 1907-1909, they were the most heavily armed destroyers of their era with five 12-pounder guns. They pioneered oil firing which would become standard in later classes.
