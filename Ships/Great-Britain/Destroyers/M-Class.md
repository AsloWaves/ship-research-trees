# Admiralty M-Class Destroyers (1914)

## Overview
The Admiralty M-class were the first mass-produced British destroyers of WWI, with 74 ships built 1914-1916 across multiple builders. They established the standardized destroyer design that would be repeated through the war, featuring three 4-inch guns, increased size, and oil firing. The class served extensively throughout WWI in all theaters.
