# Acheron-Class Destroyers (I-Class) (1910)

## Overview
The Acheron-class (I-Class) were enlarged and improved versions of the Acorn-class, with 23 ships built 1910-1911. They featured increased displacement for better seaworthiness, improved armament placement, and enhanced endurance. The class represented the peak of pre-WWI destroyer design before the transition to the larger Acasta-class.
