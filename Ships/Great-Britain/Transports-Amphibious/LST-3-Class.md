**British-Built LSTs** - LST(3)-Class were British and Canadian-built tank landing ships, 140 completed 1944-1945. Could carry 40-ton Churchill tanks at 10 knots. Many served into 1970s (20+ years service).

**Key Specs:** 2,140/5,060 tons | 347ft | 13 kn | 10 tanks + 15 vehicles | 163 troops | 40-ton capacity

**Innovation:** Developed to meet Britain's need for additional LSTs for spring 1945 operations, with 80 originally planned for British and Canadian construction. Design requirement was to carry heavy Churchill tanks (40 tons) at 10 knots. By war's end, 140 had been completed (44 British, 28 Canadian). Larger and more capable than earlier LST(2) Lend-Lease vessels.

**Service:** Entered service late WWII for planned operations in Europe and Pacific. Many LST(3)s provided over 20 years of post-war service through the 1970s, testament to robust British design and construction. Used for peacetime logistics and amphibious training operations. Crew of 104 (14 officers, 90 men) plus 163 embarked troops (13 officers, 150 troops).

**Variants:**
- **LST(A) "Assault" Variant** - Reinforced structure for heaviest tanks
- **LST(C) Command Vessels** - LST 3043 and 3044 converted to command ships with additional communications equipment

**Armament:** Some ships fitted with 8× 20mm Oerlikon guns for anti-aircraft defense. Generally lightly armed as logistics vessels operating behind front lines. Could carry 10 tanks plus 15 additional vehicles, or mix of heavy vehicles totaling similar weight.

**Production:** 44 built in British shipyards, 28 in Canadian yards. Represented significant British/Canadian shipbuilding achievement during final year of war. Superior to earlier improvised conversions, though arrived too late to see extensive WWII combat service.
