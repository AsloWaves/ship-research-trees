**Early Assault Ship** - HMS Glengyle was Glen Line merchant vessel converted to Landing Ship Infantry (Large) 1940. Carried 700 troops + 24 landing craft. Participated in 14+ major amphibious operations including Crete, Dieppe, Sicily, Normandy.

**Key Specs:** 8,887/9,919 tons | 460ft | 17 kn | 700 troops | 24 LCA + 1 LCM | 50-ton derrick

**Innovation:** Built 1939 for Glen Line Far East trade, acquired by Admiralty shortly after launch and converted to infantry landing ship April-June 1940. After refit, carried 24 Landing Craft Assault (using luffing davits and inboard cradles), additional LCM, and 50-ton derrick for landing craft launch. Could accommodate 34 officers and 663 other ranks (700 troops total).

**Major Operations:** Participated in extraordinary number of amphibious operations throughout WWII:
- **1940:** Bardia raid
- **1941:** Evacuations from Greece and Crete (evacuated 10,500 total), Syria-Lebanon campaign
- **1942:** **Dieppe Raid** (disguised as tanker)
- **1942:** Operation Torch (North Africa landings)
- **1943:** **Sicily invasion**
- **1943:** **Salerno landings**
- **1944:** **Anzio landings**
- **1945:** Post-war: Transported troops to Hong Kong, Singapore, Kure; returned liberated POWs

**Armament:** Well-defended with 3× QF 4-inch Mk XVI twin guns, 2× 2-pounder quad AA guns, and 12× 20mm single guns. Powered by 2× six-cylinder Burmeister & Wain engines producing 12,000 bhp total for 17-knot speed.

**Post-War:** Returned to merchant service 3 March 1948 after exceptional wartime career. Sister ships Glenearn, Glenroy, and Breconshire (lost 1942) were also Glen Line conversions to LSI role, forming core of early British amphibious assault capability.
