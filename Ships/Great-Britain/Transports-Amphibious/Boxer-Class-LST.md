**Britain's First LSTs** - Boxer-class were Britain's first purpose-built landing ship tanks (3 ships, 1943). 18 knots. Carried 13 Churchill tanks + 27 vehicles + 200 troops. High-speed assault ships.

**Key Specs:** 5,400/5,900 tons | 394ft | 18 kn | 13 Churchill tanks + 27 vehicles | 200 troops | 140ft ramp

**Innovation:** Britain's first purpose-built LSTs, designed for high-speed amphibious assault at 18 knots (even when laden). Could carry 13 Churchill infantry tanks plus 27 other vehicles and nearly 200 troops. Featured 140-foot (43m) bow ramp for direct beach landing. Built by Harland & Wolff starting March 1941.

**Ships:**
- **HMS Boxer (F121)** - Laid down 31 July 1941, launched 12 December 1942, commissioned 1 August 1943. **Converted to fighter direction ship** for ground-controlled aircraft interception. Served at D-Day Normandy landings.
- **HMS Bruiser (F127)** - Launched October 1942, commissioned March 1943. Participated in **Salerno landings** (Allied invasion of Italy).
- **HMS Thruster** - Participated in **Salerno landings** September 1943.

**Service:** Only HMS Boxer was converted to fighter direction ship, unique capability for controlling aircraft during amphibious operations. Bruiser and Thruster participated in Salerno landings during Allied invasion of Italy (Operation Avalanche, September 1943). Boxer served at Normandy providing air control for landing operations.

**Design Philosophy:** Class not mass-produced as simpler US LST Mk.2 design (LST(2)-Class) proved more practical for large-scale construction. However, Boxer-class offered superior speed (18 knots vs 12 knots) making them valuable for rapid assault missions. All three served into 1950s before decommissioning.
