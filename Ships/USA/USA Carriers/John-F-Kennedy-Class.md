**Last Oil Carrier** - John F. Kennedy (CV-67) was last conventional-powered carrier built for US Navy. Modified Kitty Hawk-class design commissioned 1968. Served 39 years until 2007.

**Key Specs:** 61,000/82,655 tons | 1,052ft | 33/34 kn | 85 aircraft | 280,000 shp | Modern missile defense

**Innovation:** Modified Kitty Hawk design with improved electronics, radar, and defensive systems. Relocated sonar dome. Improved underwater protection. Better island arrangement. Enhanced electronics suite. Last conventional supercarrier - bridge to nuclear age.

**Design:** Modified Kitty Hawk-class. Four-shaft steam turbines. Four C7 boilers. Four steam catapults. Four deck-edge elevators. Angled flight deck. Improved SPS-48/49 radar. Enhanced electronic warfare suite.

**Famous Deployments:**
- **Mediterranean deployments** - NATO operations
- **Gulf War 1991** - Desert Storm operations
- **Operation Southern Watch** - Iraq no-fly zone
- **Operation Enduring Freedom** - Afghanistan 2002

**Service:** Mediterranean Fleet 1969-2007. Mayport, Florida homeport. Desert Storm 1991. Balkans operations 1990s. Afghanistan 2002. Decommissioned 2007. Currently stored in Philadelphia awaiting donation as museum ship.

**Significance:** Last non-nuclear carrier. End of conventional supercarrier era. Demonstrated that even improved conventional carriers couldn't match nuclear range and endurance. Paved way for all-nuclear carrier force.
