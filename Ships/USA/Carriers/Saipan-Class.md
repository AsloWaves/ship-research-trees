**Purpose-Built CVL** - Saipan-class were first purpose-built light carriers. 2 ships commissioned 1946-1947. Based on improved Baltimore-class cruiser hull. Completed too late for WWII.

**Key Specs:** 14,500/19,600 tons | 684ft | 33 kn | 42-48 aircraft | 120,000 shp | 40× 40mm AA

**Innovation:** First light carriers designed from keel up as carriers (Independence-class were converted cruisers). Improved Baltimore-class hull. Better aviation facilities than conversions. Fast (33 knots) to keep up with fleet. Optimized layout.

**Design:** Purpose-designed CVL using cruiser propulsion plant. Four-shaft geared turbines. Good speed and maneuverability. Two elevators. Two hydraulic catapults. Larger flight deck than Independence. Better hangar arrangement.

**Service:** Commissioned postwar, never saw combat. Training carriers. Jet operations trials. Wright converted to command ship (CC-2) 1963. Saipan decommissioned 1957. Wright served as command ship until 1970.

**Significance:** Bridge between WWII light carriers and postwar supercarriers. Last light carriers built by US Navy. Demonstrated that purpose-built CVLs were superior to conversions, but supercarriers made CVL concept obsolete.
