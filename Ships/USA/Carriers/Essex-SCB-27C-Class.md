**Angled Deck Essex** - Essex SCB-27C modernization added angled decks and steam catapults. Ultimate Essex configuration. 8 ships modernized 1955-1959. Extended service into 1990s.

**Key Specs:** 33,100/41,900 tons | 888ft | 31 kn | 70-80 jets | 150,000 shp | C-11 steam catapults

**Innovation:** Ultimate Essex modernization. Angled flight deck (8°). C-11 steam catapults. Enclosed "hurricane" bow. Improved island structure. Enhanced electronics. Mirror landing system. Strengthened arrestor gear. Most capable conventional Essex configuration.

**Modernization Changes:**
- 8° angled flight deck (British innovation)
- C-11 steam catapults (replaced hydraulic)
- Enclosed hurricane bow (improved seakeeping)
- Enhanced radar suite (SPS-8, SPS-12)
- Mirror landing system
- Improved jet blast deflectors
- Enhanced crew facilities
- Aluminum flight deck extensions

**Ships Modernized:**
CV-9 Essex, CV-14 Ticonderoga, CV-18 Wasp, CV-21 Boxer, CV-34 Oriskany, CV-36 Antietam, CV-38 Shangri-La, CV-47 Philippine Sea
