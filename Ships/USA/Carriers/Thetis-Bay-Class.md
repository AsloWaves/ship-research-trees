**First Helo Carrier** - Thetis Bay (CVHA-1) was world's first helicopter assault carrier. Converted from Commencement Bay-class CVE in 1956. Pioneered Marine Corps vertical assault operations.

**Key Specs:** 11,373/21,397 tons | 557ft | 19 kn | 20-24 helicopters | 16,000 shp | Minimal armament

**Innovation:** First ship designed to operate helicopters exclusively. Pioneered helicopter assault doctrine. Proved concept of vertical envelopment from sea. Marine Corps assault transport. Led directly to purpose-built LPH class (Iwo Jima).

**Conversion:** CVE-90 (Commencement Bay-class) converted to helicopter carrier 1956. Removed catapults and arresting gear. Enhanced maintenance facilities for helicopters. Troop berthing for Marine battalion. Vehicle/cargo holds. Helicopter refueling/rearming stations.

**Service:** Mediterranean deployments 1956-1964. Marine Corps exercises. Vertical assault trials. Lebanon Crisis 1958. Caribbean operations. Decommissioned 1964 when replaced by purpose-built Iwo Jima-class LPHs.

**Significance:** Proved helicopter assault carrier concept. Demonstrated that escort carriers could be converted for amphibious assault role. Direct predecessor to Iwo Jima (LPH-2) and later Wasp/America-class LHD/LHA amphibious assault ships.

**Legacy:** Pioneered modern amphibious warfare. First CVHA designation (changed to LPH in 1959). Validated Marine Corps vertical assault doctrine that became standard for amphibious operations.
