**First Mass CVE** - Bogue-class were first mass-produced escort carriers. 45 ships converted from C3 merchant hulls 1942-1943. Vital for convoy escort and ASW in Battle of Atlantic.

**Key Specs:** 7,800/16,000 tons | 496ft | 16.5/18 kn | 24-28 aircraft | 8,500 shp | 2× 5"/38 DP

**Innovation:** Rapid conversion of merchant hulls to escort carriers. Diesel-electric or steam turbine propulsion. Single screw. Slow but economical. Adequate for convoy escort and ASW work.

**Design:** Converted C3-class cargo ship hulls. Small flight deck. Limited hangar space. Minimal armament. Reliable if unspectacular. Many transferred to Royal Navy under Lend-Lease (Attacker class).

**Service:** Atlantic convoy escort 1942-1945. ASW patrols. Some Pacific service. Credited with numerous U-boat kills. Many returned to merchant service postwar or scrapped. Several served into 1950s as aircraft transports.
