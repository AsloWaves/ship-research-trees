**Ultimate Midway** - Midway SCB-110 modernization created ultimate configuration. Angled deck, aluminum flight deck extension, modern electronics. Midway (1970) and Coral Sea (1960) extensively rebuilt.

**Key Specs:** 62,200/74,000 tons | 979ft | 30 kn | 65-75 aircraft | 212,000 shp | C-13 steam catapults

**Innovation:** Massive rebuilding program. 13.5° angled flight deck. Aluminum flight deck extension (added 60 ft). C-13 steam catapults. Completely new island. Advanced radar suite. Enhanced armor. Modernized for F-4 Phantom and A-6 Intruder operations.

**Modernization Changes:**
- 13.5° angled flight deck
- Aluminum flight deck extension
- Completely new island superstructure
- C-13 steam catapults
- SPS-43 air search radar
- Enhanced jet blast deflectors
- Improved crew quarters
- Modern combat systems
- Enhanced armor protection

**Ships Modernized:**
- **CV-41 Midway** - SCB-110 completed 1970
- **CV-43 Coral Sea** - SCB-110A completed 1960

**Service:** Vietnam War. Indian Ocean deployments. Desert Storm 1991 (Midway). Coral Sea decommissioned 1990. Midway decommissioned 1992 - longest-serving US carrier (47 years). Midway now museum ship in San Diego.

**Significance:** Extended Midway-class service life 40+ years. Demonstrated that WWII armored carriers could be modernized to near-supercarrier capability. Last non-supercarrier fleet carriers in service.
