**Final WWII Design** - Tench-class were final evolution of WWII fleet submarine. Only 29 of 128 ordered completed due to war's end.

**Key Specs:** 1570/2416 tons | 311ft | 20/8.75kn | 10× 21" tubes, 28 torpedoes + 5" gun | 29 boats (of 128 ordered)

**Design:** Refined Balao with better internal layout, quieter machinery. Most cancelled postwar. Some later converted to GUPPY or specialized roles.

**Service:** Most saw limited WWII action (commissioned late 1944-1945). Extensive Cold War service after GUPPY conversions. Several foreign transfers. Tench preserved as museum ship (Torsk) in Baltimore.
