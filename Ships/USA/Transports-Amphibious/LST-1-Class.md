**Most Numerous Landing Ships Ever** - LST-1 class were most produced landing ships in history. 1,051 ships built 1942-1945. Revolutionary design: beach directly, unload tanks/vehicles via bow doors and ramp. Backbone of Allied amphibious operations.

**Key Specs:** 1,625/4,080 tons | 328ft | 11.6/12 kn | 20 tanks or 40 trucks | 140-230 troops | Beach directly | 1,051 ships

**Innovation:** Revolutionary concept - ship beaches itself, bow doors open, ramp extends to shore, vehicles drive directly off. Shallow draft (14 ft loaded) allowed beaching. Ballast tanks controlled draft. No need for landing craft - ships ARE the landing craft.

**Design:** Flat-bottomed hull for beaching. Bow doors and ramp. Large open tank deck runs full length of ship. Accommodations for 140-230 troops. Can carry 20 Sherman tanks or 40 trucks or 33 jeeps or equivalent mix. Defensive armament against aircraft.

**LST Nickname:** "Large Slow Target" - Crews' affectionate nickname due to 12-knot max speed and vulnerability.

**Production:**
- 1,051 ships built 1942-1945
- Built at shipyards across USA
- Modular construction for rapid production
- Some built in 4-6 months

**Cargo Capacity (Typical Loads):**
- 20× M4 Sherman medium tanks
- 40× 2½-ton trucks
- 33× jeeps + 5 trucks
- Or equivalent mix of vehicles
- Plus 140-230 troops

**Major Operations:**
- **Guadalcanal (1942):** First combat use
- **Sicily (1943):** Mediterranean operations
- **Salerno (1943):** Italian invasion
- **Normandy (June 6, 1944):** D-Day - Critical role, 230+ LSTs
- **Southern France (1944):** Operation Dragoon
- **Pacific Island Campaign:** Tarawa, Saipan, Guam, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa
- **Iwo Jima (1945):** 400+ LSTs supported operation
- **Okinawa (1945):** Largest amphibious assault

**Postwar Service:**
- **Korean War (1950-1953):** Inchon landing and operations
- **Vietnam War:** Some LSTs served
- **Foreign Transfer:** Many transferred to allied navies
- **Long Service:** Some served into 1970s-2000s

**Variants:**
- **LST(H):** Hospital ship conversions
- **LSTH:** Repair ships
- **LST(Q):** Floating barracks

**Survivors:** Several preserved as museum ships. USS LST-325 (Evansville, IN) is operational and still makes voyages.

**Legacy:** Most successful landing ship design. Revolutionary concept of direct beach assault. Over 1,000 built - largest production run of any landing ship. Critical to Allied victory in WWII. Template for all future LST designs.

**Statistics:**
- 1,051 built (LST-1 to LST-1152, numbers skipped)
- 26 lost in combat
- 13 lost to accidents
- Carried millions of tons of vehicles, supplies, troops
- Participated in every major amphibious operation 1942-1945
