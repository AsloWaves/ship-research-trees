**Ultimate US Battleship Design** - Montana-class would have been most powerful US battleships. 5 ships planned (BB-67 to BB-71). 12× 16-inch guns vs Iowa's 9. Better armor but slower (28 kn vs 33 kn). Cancelled July 1943 - carriers prioritized.

**Key Specs (Planned):** 60,500/70,965 tons | 921ft | 28 kn | 12× 16" guns (4 triple turrets) | 16.1" belt | CANCELLED

**Innovation:** Four triple 16-inch turrets (12 guns total) vs Iowa's three turrets (9 guns). Better armor protection than Iowa. Wider beam (121 ft vs Iowa's 108 ft) for stability and protection. Sacrificed speed for firepower and protection.

**Design:** Four triple 16-inch/50 cal turrets - 2 forward, 2 aft. Heavier armor than Iowa (16.1-inch belt vs 12.1-inch). Wider beam prevented Panama Canal transit. Better underwater protection. Improved AA battery. Secondary battery of 20× 5-inch/54 cal DP guns.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Iowa:** Speed (33 kn) to catch anything, firepower to sink anything
- **Montana:** Ultimate firepower and protection, moderate speed (28 kn)
- **Trade-off:** Iowa faster, Montana more powerful and armored

**Comparison with Iowa:**
| Feature | Iowa | Montana |
|---------|------|---------|
| Main Guns | 9× 16"/50 | 12× 16"/50 |
| Speed | 33 knots | 28 knots |
| Belt Armor | 12.1 inches | 16.1 inches |
| Beam | 108 ft | 121 ft |
| Displacement | 45,000 tons | 60,500 tons |
| Panama Canal | Yes | NO |

**Ships Planned:**
- **Montana (BB-67)** - Name ship
- **Ohio (BB-68)**
- **Maine (BB-69)**
- **New Hampshire (BB-70)**
- **Louisiana (BB-71)**

**Design History:**
- Design studies begun 1938
- Final design approved 1940
- Ordered 1940
- Construction suspended May 1942 (labor/materials needed for carriers)
- Formally cancelled July 21, 1943

**Cancellation Reasons:**
- **Carrier priority:** Aircraft carriers deemed more important
- **Battle of Midway (June 1942):** Proved carriers decisive
- **Resources:** Shipyard capacity needed for Essex carriers and LSTs
- **Doctrine shift:** Battleship era ending, carrier era beginning
- **Strategic:** Fast carriers more versatile than slow battleships
- **Panama Canal:** Montana couldn't transit (121 ft beam vs 110 ft limit)

**Construction Status at Cancellation:**
- **None begun:** Contracts signed but keels never laid
- **Materials:** Some armor plate and machinery ordered
- **Cost savings:** Cancellation freed resources for 2-3 Essex carriers

**What-If Completed:**
- Commissioned 1945-1946 (if built)
- Most powerful US battleships ever
- Probably limited service (like Iowas post-WWII)
- Too wide for Panama Canal - operational limitation
- Likely early decommissioning (1950s) due to cost

**Legacy:**
- Last US battleship design
- Represented peak of battleship development
- Cancellation marked end of battleship era
- Resources went to carriers instead - correct decision
- Iowa-class proved sufficient for actual needs

**Comparison to Foreign Designs:**
- **Japanese Yamato:** 9× 18.1" guns, 72,000 tons
- **Montana:** 12× 16" guns, 71,000 tons
- **British Lion (cancelled):** 9× 16" guns
- Montana would have been among most powerful battleships designed
