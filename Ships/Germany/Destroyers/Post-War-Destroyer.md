**1950 Modern Concept - Gas Turbines & Computers (Future Design)** - Concept design 1950: Post-War Destroyer. **1950 MODERN CONCEPT** incorporating post-WWII technologies. Never built - Germany had no navy post-1945. 4,000 tons standard, **4× 12.8cm DP automatic guns**, **6× 533mm torpedoes**, 37 knots (estimated). **GAS TURBINE PROPULSION** (80,000 SHP - 1950s technology!), **computer-based FCS**, **automatic gun mounts**, **reduced crew** (350 vs. 400 via automation), modern radar integration. **Transition to Cold War destroyer** concepts. Theoretical study only - Germany demilitarized.

**Key Features:** 1950 modern concept | Gas turbine propulsion! | Computer FCS | Automatic guns | Reduced crew (automation) | Modern systems | Never built | Germany demilitarized | Cold War transition

**Ships:** 0 ships (concept design only, theoretical study 1950, never built, Germany had no navy post-1945)

**Service:** None (never built). **Concept design only**: Theoretical study 1950 representing modern destroyer incorporating post-WWII technologies. Never built - Germany demilitarized under Allied occupation, no naval forces allowed. **Post-War philosophy**: **Gas turbine propulsion** - represented 1950s cutting-edge technology. Faster acceleration, simpler machinery, reduced crew requirements vs. steam turbines. Eventually adopted by navies worldwide 1960s+. **Computer-based fire control** - analog computer systems for automated target tracking, gun laying, AA engagement. Represented transition from manual to automated fire control (1950s technology level). **Automatic gun mounts** - 128mm guns with automatic loading, reduced crew requirements, higher rate of fire. Reflected lessons from late-WWII rapid-fire AA requirements. **Automation focus**: Crew reduced to 350 (vs. 400+ WWII destroyers) through automated systems, computer FCS, automatic weapons, simplified machinery. Predicted modern destroyer crew reductions. **Modern radar integration**: Integrated air search, surface search, navigation, fire control radars. Represented 1950s state-of-art electronics. **Design philosophy**: Incorporated Korean War lessons (1950-1953 contemporary), Cold War requirements (long-range operations, modern electronics, automation, efficiency). Balanced surface/AA capability with 128mm DP guns. Reduced torpedo emphasis (6× vs. 8-10× WWII) reflecting changing destroyer role. **Historical context**: 1950 - Germany occupied, demilitarized, no navy allowed. Concept study represented what West German Navy (Bundesmarine) might build if allowed modern destroyer force. Similar to contemporary US/UK/French 1950s destroyer concepts. **Why never built**: Germany prohibited from navy 1945-1955. When Bundesmarine formed 1956, purchased ex-US Fletcher-class destroyers rather than building new. Indigenous destroyer construction not begun until 1960s (Hamburg-class). **Influence**: Concept study influenced early Bundesmarine thinking. Hamburg-class destroyers (1960s) incorporated gas turbine propulsion, automated systems, computer FCS - similar to 1950 Post-War Destroyer concepts.
