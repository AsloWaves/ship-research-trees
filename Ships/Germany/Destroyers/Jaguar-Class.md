**Last Treaty Boat - Type 24 Ultimate "Big Cats"** - 4 ships commissioned 1929: **Jaguar** (Jaguar), Leopard, Luchs (Lynx), Tiger. **Last treaty-restricted destroyers** before Nazi rearmament. Type 24 ultimate design. **Named after big cats** (Type 24 predator naming). Treaty-restricted "torpedo boats" (**933 tons**, peak treaty circumvention). 933 tons, **3× 10.5cm SK C/28 guns**, **6× 533mm torpedoes**, **34.5 knots** (fastest interwar). **Best range of all interwar destroyers** (3,400 nm), **most powerful turbines** (24,000 SHP). Maintained German destroyer expertise until unrestricted construction began 1933-1935. Served entire WWII (1939-1945): Baltic Sea, convoy escort, mine-laying, Norway campaign. **Most ships survived war**, decommissioned 1945-1946. **Ended treaty period** (1919-1933) maintaining destroyer capabilities through restrictions.

**Key Features:** Last treaty boat (Type 24 ultimate) | Big cat names | 933 tons (peak circumvention) | Best range (3,400 nm) | Fastest interwar (34.5 knots) | 4 ships built | Most survived WWII | Ended treaty period

**Ships:** 4 ships (Jaguar, Leopard, Luchs, Tiger, commissioned 1929, served entire WWII 1939-1945, most survived war, decommissioned 1945-1946)

**Service:** Reichsmarine (1929-1935), Kriegsmarine (1935-1946). Interwar training and operations (1929-1939), final years of treaty restrictions. WWII service (1939-1945): Baltic Sea operations, convoy escort duties, mine-laying missions, anti-submarine patrols, **Norway campaign** (1940), North Sea patrols, English Channel operations, training duties throughout war. Peak capabilities of treaty-restricted design: best range enabled extended operations, highest speed allowed effective torpedo attacks and evasion, powerful engines provided excellent performance. Most ships survived entire war demonstrating superb construction quality. Decommissioned 1945-1946. **Last treaty-restricted destroyers** - represented culmination of German efforts to maintain destroyer expertise under Treaty of Versailles restrictions (1919-1933). Type 23/24 program (1926-1929) successfully circumvented 800-ton limits while maintaining modern destroyer capabilities: 923-933 tons, 10.5cm guns, 533mm torpedoes, 33-34 knots. This expertise enabled rapid transition to unrestricted Type 1934 destroyers (3,165 tons) when Nazi rearmament began 1933-1935. Jaguar-class closed treaty period, opened path to modern destroyer construction.
