**Germaniawerft Type 1913 Design - WWI Main Line** - 6 ships commissioned 1914-1915: G37-G42. Germaniawerft variant of revolutionary **Type 1913** mass production program. Part of 71-ship V25-class family. 691 tons, **3× 10.5cm guns**, **6× 50cm torpedoes**, **34.8 knots** (slightly faster than V-series variants). **Best range of Type 1913 design** (2,500 nm) with Germaniawerft turbines (17,000 SHP) providing excellent performance. Enhanced seakeeping for North Sea operations. Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916), North Sea patrols, mine-laying. Several losses during war. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles.

**Key Features:** Germaniawerft Type 1913 (part of 71-ship program) | Slightly faster (34.8 knots) | Best range (2,500 nm) | 6× torpedoes | 10.5cm guns | Battle of Jutland | WWI main line

**Ships:** 6 ships (G37-G42, commissioned 1914-1915, Battle of Jutland participants, several WWI losses, survivors scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1914-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service entire war, High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - engaged in night torpedo attacks, destroyer actions), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations, convoy escort duties. Germaniawerft design provided excellent reliability and performance throughout war. Several ships lost in combat (mines, surface engagements, torpedo attacks). Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles. Part of larger V25-class mass production program (71 ships total) that established German torpedo warfare doctrine. G-series demonstrated German shipbuilding industry's ability to produce destroyers from multiple yards simultaneously with consistent quality and performance.
