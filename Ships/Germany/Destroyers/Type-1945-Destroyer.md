**Ultimate Paper Design - Radical Hybrid Propulsion (Never Built)** - Theoretical design 1946: Type 1945 destroyer. **ULTIMATE WWII PAPER DESIGN!** Theoretical only - never built. 3,500 tons standard, **6× 12.8cm SK C/41 DP guns**, **10× 533mm torpedoes**, 40 knots (estimated). **RADICAL HYBRID PROPULSION** (diesel/gas turbine, 90,000 SHP - EXPERIMENTAL!), **UNPRECEDENTED RANGE** (12,000 nm!), **moderate armor** (40mm belt, 25mm deck), **revolutionary radar/computer FCS**, **most AA guns** (10× 37mm, 30× 20mm!). **Combined WWII lessons + post-war concepts**: hybrid propulsion, computer fire control, moderate protection, extreme endurance. **Theoretical design** never realized - war ended.

**Key Features:** Ultimate paper design! | Hybrid diesel/gas turbine! | Unprecedented range (12,000 nm!) | Moderate armor (40mm belt!) | Revolutionary computer FCS | Most AA ever | Theoretical only | Never built | Post-war concepts

**Ships:** 0 ships (theoretical design only, paper study 1946, never built, Germany defeated)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (never existed). **Theoretical design only**: Developed as theoretical study 1946 representing ultimate German destroyer evolution if war had continued. Never built - Germany defeated May 1945. **Type 1945 philosophy**: **Hybrid diesel/gas turbine propulsion** - RADICAL experimental concept decades ahead of time! Diesel for cruising efficiency (extended range), gas turbine for high-speed combat (40 knots). Combined benefits of both technologies. **Unprecedented range** (12,000 nm at 19 knots) - could circumnavigate globe without refueling! Optimized for global naval warfare. **Moderate armor protection** (40mm belt, 25mm deck, 50mm conning tower) - influenced by US Fletcher-class destroyer escorts. First German destroyer with significant protection. **Revolutionary radar/computer FCS** - theoretical analog computer fire control system, integrated multi-target tracking, automated AA engagement. Decades ahead of actual technology! **Heaviest armament**: 6× 128mm DP guns (balanced surface/AA), 10× 533mm torpedoes (2 quintuple mounts!), 10× 37mm AA (twin mounts), 30× 20mm AA for saturation defense. **Design philosophy**: Incorporated post-war concepts - hybrid propulsion, computer systems, moderate armor, extreme range, balanced firepower. Represented what 1950s destroyer might look like if Germany had won/survived. **Why never built**: Germany defeated before study completed. Hybrid propulsion unproven and extremely complex. Computer FCS beyond 1940s technology. Gas turbines not viable for ships until 1950s+. Resources nonexistent. **Historical significance**: Most advanced theoretical destroyer design from any WWII nation. Predicted several postwar destroyer trends: gas turbine propulsion (1960s+), computer fire control (1950s+), global range requirements, balanced armament. **Ultimate concept**: Type 1945 represented absolute peak of German destroyer evolution - incorporated 47 years of lessons (1898-1945) plus theoretical post-war advances. Never realized but influenced postwar naval thinking worldwide.
