**Last WWII Design - Most Advanced German DD (Never Completed)** - Single ship planned 1945: Z50. **Last Type 1936C** and final WWII German destroyer. **Never completed** (25% construction when war ended). 2,663 tons standard, **4× 12.8cm SK C/41 DP guns**, **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 39.2 knots (estimated). **Ultimate AA armament** (22× 20mm!), **most advanced radar** fire control (planned). **Most advanced WWII German destroyer on paper** - never realized. Scuttled incomplete May 1945. **End of conventional German DD development**.

**Key Features:** Last WWII design | Most advanced (on paper) | Never completed (25%) | Ultimate AA (22× 20mm!) | Advanced radar planned | Single ship | Scuttled 1945 | End of line | Ultimate concept unrealized

**Ships:** 1 ship (Z50, never completed: 25% construction, scuttled incomplete May 1945 at shipyard)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (never operational). **Never completed**: Construction began late 1944, only 25% complete when Germany surrendered May 1945. Scuttled on slips to prevent Soviet capture. **Type 1936C final variant**: Incorporated all late-war improvements - most advanced radar fire control system planned, ultimate AA battery (22× 20mm for defense against Allied air superiority), refined 128mm dual-purpose guns for balanced surface/AA capability. **Design philosophy**: Represented culmination of German destroyer evolution 1934-1945. Learned from Type 1934 stability problems, Type 1936A 150mm top-weight issues, Type 1936B balanced return, integrated all combat lessons. **Historical significance**: Last conventional German destroyer design before experimental Z51 diesel and Type 1944 radical concepts. **End of the line**: Z50 marked end of German WWII destroyer development - war ended before completion, no successor Type 1936D planned. Would have been Germany's most capable destroyer if completed combining speed, firepower, AA defense, radar integration. **Legacy**: Unrealized potential - German destroyer development peaked on paper but never demonstrated in combat. Shows what Germany could have built with more time/resources.
