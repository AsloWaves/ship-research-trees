**First True "Large Torpedo Boats" - Effectively Destroyers (1911 Program)** - 6 ships commissioned 1911-1912: V1-V6. First true "Large Torpedo Boats" (1911 Program), effectively first German destroyers. 573 tons, **2× 8.8cm guns** (upgraded from 5cm), **4× 50cm torpedoes** (first), 33 knots. Mixed coal/oil firing for extended range (1,950 nm). Higher firepower and larger hull made these true destroyers despite "torpedo boat" designation. Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916). Survivors scrapped 1919-1920.

**Key Features:** First true "Large Torpedo Boats" (effectively destroyers, 573 tons) | First 8.8cm guns | First 50cm torpedoes | 33 knots | Battle of Jutland | Served entire WWI

**Ships:** 6 ships (V1-V6, commissioned 1911-1912, Battle of Jutland participants, survivors scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1911-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service, High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - multiple ships engaged in night actions, torpedo attacks on British battlecruisers), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations. Several losses from mines, surface engagements. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles. Established "Large Torpedo Boat" template: 550-600 tons, 2× 8.8cm guns, 4× 50cm torpedoes, 33 knots. Foundation for all subsequent German WWI destroyer development.
