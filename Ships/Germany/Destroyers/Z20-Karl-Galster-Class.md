**Type 1936 Improved - Sole Narvik Survivor** - Single ship commissioned 1939: **Z20 Karl Galster**. Type 1936 improved with **enhanced seakeeping**. **Only Type 1936 destroyer to survive Battles of Narvik** (10-13 April 1940) when 5 sister ships lost. 1,815 tons standard, **5× 12.7cm guns**, **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 40.2 knots. Enhanced seakeeping (wider beam 38.7 ft), better range (4,900 nm), enhanced AA (8× 20mm). Named after Karl Galster (German admiral). **Survived entire WWII** (1939-1945): Atlantic operations, English Channel, convoy escort, North Sea patrols. Scuttled 1945. **Proved Type 1936 design viability** despite Narvik disaster. Last German destroyer with 127mm guns.

**Key Features:** Type 1936 improved | Sole Narvik survivor (Z20 only) | Enhanced seakeeping | 40.2 knots | Better range (4,900 nm) | Enhanced AA | Survived entire WWII | Proved design viability

**Ships:** 1 ship (Z20 Karl Galster, commissioned 1939, sole Type 1936 Narvik survivor, served entire WWII 1939-1945, scuttled 1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1939-1945). WWII service (1939-1945): **Invasion of Norway** (April 1940), **First & Second Battles of Narvik** (10 & 13 April 1940 - **SOLE SURVIVOR** among Type 1936 ships: Z17/Z18/Z19/Z21/Z22 all lost, Z20 escaped destruction), Atlantic convoy operations, English Channel operations, North Sea patrols, mine-laying missions, convoy escort duties. Enhanced seakeeping design proved superior to sister ships, possibly contributing to survival. Post-Narvik service (1940-1945): valuable operational experience, training duties, secondary operations. **Survived entire war** demonstrating excellent construction quality and crew skill. Scuttled May 1945 to prevent capture. **Type 1936 improved** represented lessons learned from Type 1934A: better seakeeping through wider beam, enhanced AA capability, improved range. Z20's survival validated design improvements. Last German destroyer with 127mm guns before revolutionary Type 1936A "Narvik" class introduced 150mm guns, changing destroyer warfare forever.
