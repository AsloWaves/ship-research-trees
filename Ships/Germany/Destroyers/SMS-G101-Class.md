**Type 1914 Improved - Fastest WWI German Destroyers (36 Knots!)** - 8 ships commissioned 1915-1916: G101-G108. Germaniawerft **Type 1914 improved** design, late war refinement. 835 tons (largest German WWI destroyers), **3× 10.5cm guns**, **1× 8.8cm AA gun**, **6× 50cm torpedoes**, **36.0 knots** (fastest WWI German destroyers!). **Most powerful Germaniawerft turbines** (21,000 SHP), **longest range** (2,700 nm) for extended operations. Enhanced seakeeping and improved fire control over B97-class. Late war completion (1915-1916) meant limited combat service but represented **ultimate Germaniawerft WWI destroyer design**. Served: Late war High Seas Fleet operations, North Sea patrols, convoy escort. Several losses. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles.

**Key Features:** Type 1914 improved (late war) | Fastest WWI German DDs (36.0 knots!) | Longest range (2,700 nm) | Largest (835 tons) | Germaniawerft pinnacle | AA gun | 8 ships built

**Ships:** 8 ships (G101-G108, commissioned 1915-1916, late war limited service, several combat losses, survivors scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1915-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1915-1918): Late war completion severely limited frontline service. Arrived after **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916). Conducted post-Jutland High Seas Fleet operations, North Sea patrols, convoy escort missions, mine-laying operations, anti-submarine patrols. Advanced design with excellent seakeeping made them ideal for extended North Sea and Atlantic patrols. Improved fire control and AA capability reflected late-war combat lessons. Several ships lost in final year of war (mines, surface engagements). Survivors interned 1918-1919, scrapped under Treaty of Versailles 1919-1920. **Ultimate Germaniawerft WWI destroyer design** - fastest speed, longest range, best seakeeping. Represented peak of German WWI destroyer development before Treaty restrictions ended the evolutionary line until 1920s rearmament.
