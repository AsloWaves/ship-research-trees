**First Post-Versailles Treaty Warship - Type 23 "Birds of Prey"** - 6 ships commissioned 1926-1927: **Möwe** (Seagull), Greif (Griffon), Seeadler (Sea Eagle), Albatros, Kondor, Falke. **First German warships after Treaty of Versailles** restrictions (officially under 800 tons, **actually 923 tons**!). 923 tons, **3× 10.5cm SK C/28 guns**, **6× 533mm torpedoes**, 33.5 knots. **First German destroyer with full oil firing** (vs. coal/oil mix). Excellent range (3,100 nm) for extended operations. **Named after birds of prey** (Type 23 naming convention). Maintained German destroyer expertise during treaty period. Served entire WWII (1939-1945): Baltic Sea operations, convoy escort, mine-laying, English Channel operations, Norway campaign. **Many ships survived entire war**, last decommissioned 1946. Proved treaty restrictions could be circumvented while maintaining modern capabilities.

**Key Features:** First post-Versailles (1926) | Treaty restrictions exceeded (923 tons) | Bird names (Type 23) | First full oil firing | Modern 10.5cm guns | 6 ships built | Served entire WWII | Many survivors

**Ships:** 6 ships (Möwe, Greif, Seeadler, Albatros, Kondor, Falke, commissioned 1926-1927, served entire WWII 1939-1945, many survived war, last decommissioned 1946)

**Service:** Reichsmarine (1926-1935), Kriegsmarine (1935-1946). Interwar training and operations, maintained German destroyer tactics and expertise during treaty period. WWII service (1939-1945): Baltic Sea operations, convoy escort, mine-laying, anti-submarine patrols, **English Channel operations** (1940-1944), **Norway campaign** (1940), North Sea patrols, training duties. Limited combat capability compared to modern destroyers but proved valuable for secondary operations. Several ships survived entire war demonstrating excellent construction quality. Last ships decommissioned 1946. **Type 23** represented clever circumvention of Treaty of Versailles restrictions: officially "torpedo boats under 800 tons" but actually 923-ton destroyers with modern capabilities. Maintained German destroyer design expertise and trained crews during treaty period, enabling rapid destroyer expansion when Nazi rearmament began 1933-1935.
