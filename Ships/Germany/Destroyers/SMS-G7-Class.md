**Germaniawerft 1911 Program Design** - 6 ships commissioned 1911-1912: G7-G12. Germaniawerft design variant of 1911 Program "Large Torpedo Boats". 573 tons, 2× 8.8cm guns, 4× 50cm torpedoes, 33.2 knots (slightly faster than V1-class). Better range (2,000 nm) for extended North Sea operations. Germaniawerft turbines provided excellent performance. 6 ships built (proven design). Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916). Many survived WWI, scrapped 1919-1920.

**Key Features:** Germaniawerft 1911 design (G-series) | Slightly faster (33.2 knots) | Better range (2,000 nm) | 6 ships built | Battle of Jutland | Many WWI survivors

**Ships:** 6 ships (G7-G12, commissioned 1911-1912, Battle of Jutland participants, many survivors, scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1911-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service entire war, High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - multiple ships engaged in night actions), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations, convoy escort. Several losses but many survived WWI. Germaniawerft design proved reliable and well-suited to North Sea combat. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles. Parallel design to V1-class, demonstrated German industry's capability to produce destroyers from multiple shipyards simultaneously.
