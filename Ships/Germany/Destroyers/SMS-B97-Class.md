**Type 1914 - Advanced WWI Design, Fastest Destroyers** - 16 ships commissioned 1914-1915: B97-B112. First **Type 1914** design representing ultimate WWI German destroyer development. 812 tons (largest WWI destroyers yet), **3× 10.5cm guns**, **first dedicated AA gun** (1× 8.8cm AA), **6× 50cm torpedoes**, **35.5 knots** (fastest WWI German destroyers). **Most powerful engines** (20,000 SHP turbines), **best range** (2,600 nm) for extended Atlantic operations. Enhanced seakeeping and improved stability over earlier classes. Many ships completed late in war (1915-1916), saw limited service but represented culmination of German WWI destroyer evolution. Served: High Seas Fleet operations, North Sea patrols, some Battle of Jutland (late arrivals). Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles.

**Key Features:** Type 1914 (ultimate WWI design) | Largest WWI German DDs (812 tons) | Fastest (35.5 knots) | First AA gun | Best range (2,600 nm) | 16 ships built | Late war completion

**Ships:** 16 ships (B97-B112, commissioned 1914-1915, late completions saw limited WWI service, survivors scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1914-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Late completion meant limited frontline service for many ships. Early units participated in North Sea patrols, convoy escort, mine-laying operations. Some ships arrived too late for **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916) but conducted post-Jutland operations. Enhanced seakeeping made them suitable for extended Atlantic patrols and bad weather operations. Better accommodation and range than earlier destroyers. Several combat losses. Survivors interned 1918-1919, scrapped under Treaty of Versailles 1919-1920. **Type 1914 design** represented culmination of German WWI destroyer development: largest size, highest speed, best range, first AA capability. These ships showed what German destroyer design could achieve before Treaty restrictions imposed limits on post-war construction.
