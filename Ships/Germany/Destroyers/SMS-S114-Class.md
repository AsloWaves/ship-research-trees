**Refined Coastal Torpedo Boat Design** - 12 ships commissioned 1902-1903: S114-S125. Refined coastal torpedo boat with larger hull and improved range. 485 tons, 3× 5cm guns, 3× 45cm torpedoes, 27.5 knots. +97 tons vs. S90-class for better seakeeping and endurance. Improved range (1,500 nm) for extended North Sea patrols. Proven design with 12 ships built. WWI coastal operations (1914-1918): North Sea patrols, mine-laying, convoy escort. Many losses in WWI from mine/submarine attacks. Most scrapped 1918-1920.

**Key Features:** Refined coastal design (485 tons, +97 tons vs. S90) | Improved range (1,500 nm) | 12 ships built | WWI coastal operations | Many WWI losses

**Ships:** 12 ships (S114-S125, commissioned 1902-1903, many WWI losses, survivors scrapped 1918-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1902-1920). Coastal defense, North Sea patrols, Baltic operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Coastal patrol, mine-laying operations, convoy escort, submarine defense. North Sea and Baltic operations. Many losses from British mines, submarine attacks, surface engagements. Obsolete by WWI standards but served coastal defense role. Survivors withdrawn from frontline service 1917-1918, scrapped 1918-1920. Demonstrated need for larger, more seaworthy torpedo boats for North Sea combat conditions.
