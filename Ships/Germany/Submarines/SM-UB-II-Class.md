**Improved Coastal - Doubled Size & Diesel Propulsion** - 30 boats commissioned 1915-1916: UB-18 to UB-47. **Improved coastal submarine** with **DOUBLED SIZE** (263 tons vs. UB-I 127 tons!). 263 tons surfaced, **2× 50cm torpedo tubes**, 4 torpedoes carried (doubled!), 9.2 knots surfaced/5.8 knots submerged. **Diesel propulsion** (safer than UB-I gasoline!), **1× 8.8cm deck gun** (added!), **6,450 nm range** (quadrupled!). 30 boats built - Mediterranean/Flanders workhorse. Larger crew (23), faster, more capable than UB-I.

**Key Features:** Doubled size (263 tons!) | Diesel propulsion (safer!) | 30 boats built | 4 torpedoes (doubled) | Deck gun added (8.8cm!) | 6,450 nm range (4×!) | Faster (9.2 knots) | Mediterranean/Flanders workhorse

**Ships:** 30 boats (UB-18 to UB-47, commissioned 1915-1916, WWI coastal operations, heavy losses, few survivors scrapped 1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1915-1920). WWI service (1915-1918): **Doubled size revolutionary**: UB-II at 263 tons DOUBLE UB-I (127 tons). Addressed UB-I limitations - more torpedoes (4 vs. 2), deck gun added, vastly extended range (6,450 nm vs. 1,650 nm). Far more effective coastal submarine. **Diesel propulsion critical**: Switched from dangerous gasoline (UB-I) to safer diesel. Eliminated fire/fume hazards in enclosed hull. Improved reliability. Became standard for all subsequent U-boats. **Mediterranean workhorse**: UB-18 to UB-35 deployed Mediterranean/Adriatic. Attacked Allied shipping in confined waters (Otranto Straits, Aegean, coastal routes). UB-23 sank 43 ships (98,337 tons) in Mediterranean! **Flanders Flotilla**: UB-36 to UB-47 operated from Bruges/Zeebrugge bases. Attacked English Channel shipping, Dover Strait patrols. Short-range missions against British coastal traffic. **Deck gun advantage**: 8.8cm gun enabled surface attacks on unescorted merchants without using precious torpedoes. Could sink 2 ships with torpedoes, many more with deck gun. Combat effectiveness greatly increased. **Combat losses**: Heavy losses 1915-1918 (29 of 30 lost!). UB-18 sunk March 1918 (depth charge). UB-26 sunk April 1917 (mine). UB-35 sunk May 1918 (torpedo). Only UB-44 survived war. **Historical significance**: Proved coastal submarine concept viable at larger size. UB-I too small/limited. UB-II doubled size optimal for Mediterranean/Flanders operations. **Legacy**: UB-II lessons directly influenced UB-III (96 boats!). Diesel propulsion, deck gun, 4-torpedo armament became coastal submarine standard. Influenced WWII Type II coastal boats (similar size/role).
