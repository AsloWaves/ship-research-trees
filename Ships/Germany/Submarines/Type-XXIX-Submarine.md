**Ultimate WWII Design - Paper Ship Only!** - 0 boats built: **ULTIMATE WWII ELEKTROBOOT!** Theoretical maximum elektroboot performance. **22 KNOTS SUBMERGED!** (fastest concept!). **30 TORPEDOES** (maximum armament!). **8 torpedo tubes** (6 bow, 2 stern!). **12-minute reload** (ultimate automation!). **20,000 nm range** (ultimate endurance!). **600 ft diving depth** (deepest!). 2200 tons, perfect streamlining, theoretical optimum hydrodynamics. **PAPER SHIP ONLY** - cancelled 1945, never built. Shows theoretical limits of diesel-electric submarine technology 1945.

**Key Features:** 22 KNOTS SUBMERGED! | 30 torpedoes! | 8 tubes! | 12-min reload! | 20,000 nm range! | 600 ft depth! | Perfect streamlining | Ultimate automation | PAPER SHIP | Theoretical maximum | Never built

**Ships:** 0 boats (paper ship - concept only, cancelled 1945, shows theoretical elektroboot limits)

**Service:** None (never built). **ULTIMATE WWII ELEKTROBOOT** - theoretical maximum performance diesel-electric submarine 1945. **Paper ship** cancelled when Germany surrendered. Represented **theoretical limits** of elektroboot technology. Nuclear submarines (USS Nautilus 1954) made concept obsolete. Type XXIX showed diesel-electric peak: **22 kts submerged** (achievable with maximum batteries), **20,000 nm range**, **600 ft depth**, **30 torpedoes**. But nuclear power rendered approach obsolete - unlimited endurance superior to marginal speed increases.
