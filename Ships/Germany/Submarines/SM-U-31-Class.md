**WWI Ocean-Going Attack U-boat - Reliable Germaniawerft Design** - 11 boats commissioned 1914-1915: U-31 to U-41. **WWI ocean-going attack U-boat** from Germaniawerft. **Reliable diesel engines** established German submarine effectiveness. 685 tons surfaced, **4× 50cm torpedo tubes**, 6 torpedoes carried, 16.4 knots surfaced/9.5 knots submerged. **7,800 nm range** (ocean-going!), 1× 8.8cm deck gun. **Unrestricted submarine warfare** campaign against Allied shipping. Conducted Atlantic operations, commerce raiding. Germaniawerft design proved diesel reliability for submarine warfare.

**Key Features:** WWI ocean-going | Germaniawerft diesel (reliable!) | 11 boats built | 7,800 nm range | Unrestricted warfare | Atlantic capable | Commerce raiding | Reliable diesel propulsion

**Ships:** 11 boats (U-31 to U-41, commissioned 1914-1915, WWI Atlantic/North Sea operations, most lost in combat, surrendered boats scrapped 1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1914-1920). WWI service (1914-1918): **Unrestricted submarine warfare campaign** against Allied merchant shipping. Atlantic operations targeting British supply lines. Commerce raiding missions sank hundreds of merchant vessels. North Sea operations against Royal Navy warships. **Germaniawerft diesel engines** proved reliable for extended ocean patrols - could operate for weeks without return to port. **Combat losses**: Most U-31 class lost in combat 1915-1918 (depth charges, mines, ramming, Q-ship attacks). U-31 herself sunk March 1915 by British submarine E16. U-35 (Flanders Flotilla) became most successful WWI U-boat - sank 224 ships (539,741 tons)! Commander Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière most successful submarine ace in history. **Unrestricted warfare**: February 1917, Germany declared unrestricted submarine warfare - attacked all ships in war zone without warning. U-31 class sank Allied merchant ships faster than they could be replaced, nearly starving Britain. Brought USA into war April 1917. **Historical significance**: Established ocean-going U-boat template - diesel propulsion, 4× torpedo tubes, deck gun, extended range. Proved submarines could dominate maritime trade warfare. **Legacy**: U-31 class validated German U-boat program. Led to massive WWI expansion (380 U-boats commissioned). Influenced WWII Type VII design (similar displacement, range, armament). Germaniawerft continued building submarines through WWII.
