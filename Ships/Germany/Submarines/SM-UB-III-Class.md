**Advanced Coastal "Coastal Master" - 96 Boats Built!** - 96 boats commissioned 1917-1918: UB-48 to UB-143. **MOST NUMEROUS WWI COASTAL CLASS!** **Advanced coastal submarine** with **"Coastal Master" special ability** (+30% coastal operations). 516 tons surfaced, **5× 50cm torpedo tubes** (4 bow, 1 stern!), **10 torpedoes carried**, 13.6 knots surfaced/8.0 knots submerged. **9,090 nm range** (EXTENDED!), 1× 8.8cm deck gun, enhanced diesels (1,100 HP). **96 boats built** - Mediterranean dominance, Flanders Flotilla backbone. Late-war ultimate coastal design.

**Key Features:** 96 BOATS! (most coastal class!) | Coastal Master (+30% coastal ops!) | 10 torpedoes (5 tubes!) | 9,090 nm range! | 516 tons (largest coastal) | 13.6 knots (fast!) | Mediterranean dominance | Late-war advanced

**Ships:** 96 boats (UB-48 to UB-143, commissioned 1917-1918, late WWI operations, heavy combat losses, few survivors surrendered/scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1917-1920). Late WWI service (1917-1918): **MOST NUMEROUS COASTAL CLASS!** 96 UB-III built 1917-1918 - largest coastal submarine production ever. Proved coastal submarine concept critical for WWI maritime warfare. **"Coastal Master" dominance**: +30% coastal operations special ability reflects UB-III's exceptional effectiveness in confined waters. Optimized for Mediterranean, English Channel, Baltic operations where large ocean-going U-boats struggled. **10 torpedoes revolutionary**: 5× torpedo tubes (4 bow, 1 stern!) carrying 10 torpedoes. Rivaled ocean-going U-boats in firepower despite half the displacement (516 tons vs. 800+ tons). Could sink 5 ships per patrol before needing resupply. **Extended range**: 9,090 nm range (UB-II: 6,450 nm, UB-I: 1,650 nm). Could operate throughout entire Mediterranean from Adriatic bases. Eliminated range limitations that plagued earlier coastal boats. **Mediterranean dominance**: UB-48 to UB-100 deployed Mediterranean/Adriatic. Attacked Allied shipping lanes with devastating effectiveness. UB-68 sank 53 ships (105,671 tons)! Controlled Otranto Straits, Aegean Sea, eastern Mediterranean. **Flanders Flotilla backbone**: UB-101 to UB-143 operated from Bruges/Zeebrugge. Attacked English Channel shipping, Dover Strait blockade, coastal convoys. Forced Royal Navy to deploy massive ASW resources. **Enhanced performance**: 13.6 knots surfaced speed (UB-II: 9.2 knots) enabled attack repositioning and destroyer evasion. 8.0 knots submerged (UB-II: 5.8 knots) improved tactical flexibility. 1,100 HP diesels provided reliable power. **Combat losses**: Heavy losses late-war as Allied ASW improved dramatically. Approximately 87 of 96 UB-III lost 1917-1918! Mines, depth charges, Q-ships, aircraft, destroyers, ramming. UB-88 survived war with good record, scrapped 1920. **Historical significance**: **Ultimate WWI coastal submarine** - largest class (96 boats), most capable design, greatest combat effectiveness. Proved specialized coastal boats could equal ocean-going types in confined waters at half the cost. **Legacy**: UB-III directly influenced WWII Type II coastal submarines (similar size, role, armament). Demonstrated coastal submarine viability led to Type II mass production (50 boats). "Coastal Master" concept validated specialized designs for specific theaters.
