**World's First Practical Military Submarine - Submarine Pioneer!** - Single boat commissioned 1906: U-1. **FIRST GERMAN U-BOAT!** **World's first practical military submarine** with gasoline/electric propulsion. 238 tons surfaced, **1× 45cm torpedo tube**, 3 torpedoes carried, 10.8 knots surfaced/8.7 knots submerged. **Experimental gasoline engine** (dangerous!), lead-acid batteries, 1,500 nm range. **Pioneered submarine warfare** doctrine. Single hull with saddle tanks, 100 ft diving depth. Served WWI 1914-1918 training role. **Established German U-boat tradition** that dominated both world wars. **FREE starting submarine** for tutorial.

**Key Features:** First German U-boat! | World's first practical military sub | Gasoline/electric (experimental!) | Submarine pioneer | 238 tons | 3 torpedoes | WWI training | Established tradition | FREE starter

**Ships:** 1 boat (U-1, commissioned 1906, WWI training role 1914-1918, decommissioned 1919, scrapped 1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1906-1919). Pre-WWI service (1906-1914): **Experimental submarine** testing gasoline/electric propulsion. Proved submarine concept viable despite dangerous gasoline engines (fumes, fire risk). Established submarine warfare doctrine: submerged attacks, torpedo effectiveness, underwater endurance. Tested crew procedures, diving techniques, torpedo tactics. **WWI service** (1914-1918): By WWI start, U-1 technologically obsolete but served **training role** for new U-boat crews. Gasoline engines too dangerous for combat operations. Trained thousands of submariners who operated later diesel U-boats. **Historical significance**: **World's first practical military submarine** - pioneered entire submarine warfare concept. Earlier submarines (Turtle, Nautilus, Holland) experimental or limited. U-1 proved submarines could be effective naval weapons. **Dangerous gasoline engines**: Gasoline fumes in enclosed hull extremely hazardous - multiple accidents during testing. Led Germany to adopt safer diesel engines for U-9 and later boats. **Technical innovations**: Single hull with saddle tanks design, lead-acid battery arrays, periscope systems, diving plane controls, torpedo tube integration. All became standard submarine features. **Legacy**: Established German submarine tradition. Germany became submarine warfare pioneer (WWI unrestricted submarine warfare, WWII Type VII/XXI dominance). U-1 proved concept; successors perfected execution. **FREE starting submarine**: Players receive U-1 free for tutorial - learn submarine mechanics, underwater combat, torpedo attacks with safe historical boat before advancing to combat U-boats.
