**393 BUILT! - Electric-Only Midget!** - 393 boats commissioned 1944: Multiple series totaling 393 boats (MORE than Biber 324!). **ELECTRIC-ONLY MIDGET SUBMARINE!** **11 tons surfaced**, **10.8m long (35.4 ft)**, **1-man crew**. **Battery-only propulsion** (no combustion engine - safer than Biber gasoline!). **2× external G7e torpedoes** OR 2× mines. 4.3 knots surfaced/5.0 knots submerged. **50 nm range** (battery-limited!). Simple construction (no engine!). Eliminated Biber's gasoline explosion risk. But even higher loss rate (~85%!). Minimal combat success. Transitional design leading to Seehund.

**Key Features:** 393 BOATS! (most built!) | Electric-only (no engine!) | Battery-powered (safer!) | 11 tons (larger than Biber) | 1-man crew | 50 nm range (limited!) | 2× external torpedoes | No gasoline risk | 85% loss rate | Transitional design

**Ships:** 393 boats (multiple series, commissioned 1944, coastal defense operations, heavy losses ~85%, minimal combat success, led to Seehund development)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1944). WWII service (1944): **ELECTRIC-ONLY MIDGET!** Molch represented Germany's attempt to **eliminate Biber's dangerous gasoline engine** with battery-only propulsion. **393 boats built** (MORE than Biber's 324!) - but **even worse combat record** (~85% loss rate!). **Failed design leading to Seehund improvements**. **Design philosophy**: Name "Molch" (Salamander/Newt) - aquatic amphibian. Developed mid-1944 as Biber improvement: **Problem**: Biber's gasoline engine caused frequent explosions/fires! Many operators killed by fuel-related accidents. **Solution**: Molch used **electric motor ONLY** - no combustion engine! **Eliminated gasoline explosion risk!** Safer for operator (no toxic fumes). Simpler construction (fewer components). **Larger than Biber**: **11 tons** surfaced (Biber: 6.3 tons - 75% larger!). **10.8m long** (Biber: 9m - 20% longer!). More internal space for batteries. Still 1-man crew (solo operations). **Battery-only propulsion**: **13 HP electric motor** powered by lead-acid batteries. **No diesel, no gasoline** - purely electric! **Surface propulsion**: Electric motor only (4.3 kts). **Submerged propulsion**: Same electric motor (5.0 kts). **Advantage**: No engine noise (quieter than Biber!). No exhaust (no surface trail). Safer (no fuel explosions). **Severe limitation**: **50 nm range** (Biber: 130 nm - 62% LESS!). Battery capacity limited by small size. Could barely reach targets + return to base! Restricted to coastal operations within 25 nm of base. **Combat performance**: **Even worse than Biber!**: Biber: ~260/324 lost (80% loss rate), 1-4 ships sunk. Molch: ~334/393 lost (85% loss rate!), 0-1 ships sunk (unconfirmed!). **Why higher losses despite safer fuel?** **Severely limited range**: 50 nm meant operators often ran out of power! Many Molch drifted helpless, captured/sunk. Couldn't reach distant targets (all operations <25 nm). Return journey often impossible (battery exhausted). **Same 1-man crew problems**: Solo operator stress/exhaustion. Hypothermia in cold water. Oxygen deprivation. No assistance if problems. **Same vulnerabilities**: Small size (capsized in rough seas). 65 ft shallow depth (vulnerable to depth charges). External torpedoes (easily damaged). Weak construction (simple pressure hull). **Operational deployments**: Similar to Biber: English Channel operations (anti-invasion). North Sea operations (British coastal shipping). Dutch/German coastal bases. **But 50 nm range meant**: Could barely leave port before turning back! Most operations within 10-15 nm of base. Many missions aborted (insufficient battery). **Historical assessment**: Molch **WORSE failure than Biber**: 393 built (most numerous midget!), but 0-1 ships sunk total! 85% loss rate (334 boats lost!). Cost ~334 operators (trained submariners wasted!). **Solved wrong problem**: Fixed Biber's gasoline danger, but created WORSE range problem! 50 nm range meant Molch nearly useless combat weapon. Should have used DIESEL engine (safe + adequate range). **Why build 393 if worse than Biber?** Mid-1944: Biber gasoline explosions killing many operators. Molch seemed safer alternative (electric-only). Mass production already underway before combat failures evident. Political pressure to deploy "new weapons". By time Molch failed, already built 393 boats! **Led to Seehund development**: Germany realized midget submarine needed: **2-man crew** (1-man too stressful). **Diesel engine** (range + safety). **Internal torpedoes** (external too vulnerable). **Result**: **Seehund Type XXVII** (285 built, 2-man, diesel, internal torpedoes, 9 ships sunk). **10× more effective than Molch!** **Molch legacy**: **Cautionary tale** of fixing one problem (gasoline) while creating worse problem (range). Proved battery-only midget submarine impractical (insufficient range). Showed importance of **adequate range** over theoretical safety. **393 boats built, 0-1 ships sunk** = complete failure. **Comparison to Biber**: Biber (324): Gasoline engine, 130 nm range, 80% loss, 1-4 ships sunk. Molch (393): Electric-only, 50 nm range, 85% loss, 0-1 ships sunk. **Molch WORSE despite eliminating gasoline risk!** Range more important than fuel safety. **Post-war**: No interest in Molch design (ineffective). All captured boats scrapped. Design dead-end (electric-only impractical). Seehund diesel design became model. **Final assessment**: Molch showed **well-intentioned design changes can worsen performance**. Eliminating gasoline (good idea) but using electric-only (bad execution). Should have used diesel engine (Seehund proved this!). Molch's 85% loss rate + 0-1 ships sunk = **worst combat submarine design of WWII!**
