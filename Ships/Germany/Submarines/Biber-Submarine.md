**324 BUILT! - 9m Midget Submarine!** - 324 boats commissioned 1944: Multiple series totaling 324 boats! **MOST NUMEROUS MIDGET SUBMARINE!** **6.3 tons surfaced**, **9m long (29.5 ft!)**, **1-man crew**. **2× external G7e torpedoes** (dropped for attack!) OR 2× mines. 6.5 knots surfaced/5.3 knots submerged. Gasoline engine (unconventional!). Simple construction (175 build hours!). 130 nm range. Coastal defense and special operations. Limited combat success (high loss rate). Simple cylindrical pressure hull. Diving depth 65 ft. Mass-produced 1944-1945 for coastal defense.

**Key Features:** 324 BOATS! (most numerous midget!) | 9m long (tiny!) | 6.3 tons (smallest!) | 1-man crew (solo!) | 2× external torpedoes | Gasoline engine | 175 build hours | Coastal defense | High loss rate | Simple construction

**Ships:** 324 boats (multiple series, commissioned 1944, coastal defense operations, special attacks, heavy losses ~80%, minimal combat success)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1944-1945). WWII service (1944-1945): **MIDGET SUBMARINE!** Biber represented Germany's **mass-produced midget submarine** for coastal defense and special operations late-war. **324 boats built** - MOST NUMEROUS midget submarine of WWII! But **heavy losses** (~80% loss rate) with minimal combat success. **Desperate late-war measure**. **Design concept**: Name "Biber" (Beaver) from small, industrious animal. Germany needed cheap, quickly-built coastal defense submarines 1944: Allied invasion imminent (D-Day June 1944). Type XXI/XXIII expensive, slow to build. Midget submarines offered rapid deployment. **6.3 tons** displacement - smallest operational submarine! **9m long** (29.5 ft) - tiny! Could hide in small harbors, shallow waters. **1-man crew** - minimal personnel requirements. **Mass production focus**: Simple cylindrical pressure hull. Commercial automotive components (gasoline engine). **175 build hours** (vs. Type XXIII 4,200 hours!). Multiple small workshops could build sections. No specialized submarine yards needed. 324 boats built 1944-1945 despite Allied bombing. **Unconventional gasoline engine**: Most submarines used diesel (safer - less flammable). Biber used **32 HP gasoline engine** (automotive origin!). **Why gasoline?** Available from automobile industry. Simpler than diesel. Lighter weight. **But DANGEROUS!** Gasoline fumes in confined space = explosion risk! Many Biber lost to gasoline explosions/fires. **External torpedo mounting**: No internal torpedo tubes (too small!). **2× G7e electric torpedoes** mounted EXTERNALLY on hull sides. Attack procedure: Approach target submerged. Release torpedoes (dropped like bombs!). Torpedoes run toward target. Biber escapes. **Alternative payload**: 2× mines instead of torpedoes. Laid in shallow coastal waters. **Performance limitations**: **130 nm range** (minimal - coastal operations only!). **6.5 kts surfaced, 5.3 kts submerged** (slow!). **65 ft diving depth** (shallow - vulnerable to depth charges). **13 HP electric motor** (limited underwater endurance). Could barely maintain trim (single operator!). **1-man crew hardships**: Solo pilot operated: Navigation, diving controls, torpedo release, periscope, all systems. **Extreme physical/mental stress**. 6-12 hour missions in cramped space. No rest, no assistance. Many operators suffered hypothermia, exhaustion, oxygen deprivation. **Combat operations**: Biber deployed against Allied shipping 1944-1945: **English Channel operations**: Attacked invasion supply convoys post D-Day. Operated from French coastal bases. **North Sea operations**: Attacked British coastal shipping. Launched from Dutch/German bases. **Antwerp operations**: Targeted Allied supply port (November 1944-January 1945). Major operation: 18 Biber attacked December 1944. **Combat results**: **Limited success**: Few confirmed sinkings (estimates: 1-4 merchant ships total). **Heavy losses**: ~260 of 324 Biber lost (80% loss rate!). Causes: Gasoline explosions/fires (frequent!). Rough seas (capsized easily - small size). Hypothermia/exhaustion (1-man crew stress). Depth charges (65 ft shallow depth vulnerable). Mechanical failures (automotive components unreliable). Captured/scuttled (many bases overrun). **Why such high losses?**: Inadequate training (rushed deployment). Dangerous gasoline fuel. Extreme weather (North Sea storms). Overwhelming Allied defenses. Single operator (no backup if problems). **Antwerp operation disaster**: December 1944: 18 Biber launched to attack Antwerp. **Results**: 0 ships sunk. 17 Biber lost! Only 1 returned. Typical Biber mission outcome. **Historical assessment**: Biber **failed as combat weapon**: 324 built but sank only 1-4 ships total. 80% loss rate unsustainable. Cost ~260 operators killed/captured (trained submariners!). Diverted resources from Type XXI/XXIII programs. **Why build 324 if ineffective?**: Desperation - Germany losing war needed ANY weapon. Propaganda value - "new secret weapon" boosted morale. Quick/cheap production (175 hours vs. Type XXIII 4,200 hours). Political pressure (Hitler demanded new weapons). **Better alternatives existed**: Type XXIII (61 built) sank 5 ships, 10% loss rate. Resources better spent on Type XXIII instead of Biber. **But Biber served purpose**: Tied down Allied ASW resources. Forced convoy route changes. Psychological impact (fear of small attackers). Kept coastal defenses active. **Post-war**: No Allied interest in Biber design (too dangerous, ineffective). Several captured boats scrapped. One preserved: **Deutsches Museum, Munich** (displayed as WWII technology example). **Comparison to successful midgets**: **British X-craft**: Disabled Tirpitz (September 1943), successful special operations. **Italian CA-class**: Sank HMS Queen Elizabeth, HMS Valiant (December 1941). **Japanese Ko-hyoteki**: Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941), Sydney Harbor attack (May 1942). **Why more successful?** Multi-man crews (2-4 men vs. Biber 1). Diesel engines (safer than gasoline). Specialized missions (not mass deployment). Better training/selection. **Seehund comparison**: **Seehund Type XXVII** (285 built): 2-man crew, diesel engine, internal torpedoes, 9 ships sunk. **10× more effective than Biber!** Proved 2-man crew + diesel engine essential for midget submarine success. **Legacy**: Biber showed **midget submarines needed**: 2+ crew (solo operations too stressful). Diesel engines (gasoline too dangerous). Internal weapons (external torpedoes vulnerable). Proper training (rushed deployment failed). Biber's 80% loss rate proved mass-produced cheap submarines ineffective without quality design/training. **Cautionary tale** of desperate late-war weapons programs!
