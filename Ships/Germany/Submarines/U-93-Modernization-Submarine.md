**10.5cm Gun Upgrade - 1918 Refit** - 24 boats modernized 1918: U-93 to U-116 (entire U-93 class!). **WWI U-BOAT MODERNIZATION!** **10.5cm SK L/45 gun upgrade** (from original 8.8cm!). Enhanced surface combat capability responding to armed merchant cruisers. Maintained 1000 tons surfaced, **6× 50cm torpedo tubes**, **16 torpedoes**, 16.8 knots surfaced/9.1 knots submerged, 9000 nm range. **24 boats modernized** 1918 (war's final year). All boats post-war scrapped under Treaty of Versailles 1919-1920. Increased firepower for late-war surface engagements.

**Key Features:** 10.5cm gun upgrade! (from 8.8cm) | 24 boats modernized! | Enhanced surface combat | Late-war firepower | Armed merchant counter | WWI refit | Maintained 16 torpedoes | Entire U-93 class | Treaty of Versailles scrapping

**Ships:** 24 boats (U-93 to U-116, modernized 1918, late WWI operations, all scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1918-1919). WWI service (1918-1919): **WWI U-BOAT MODERNIZATION!** U-93 class modernization represented Germany's **late-war upgrade program** enhancing surface combat capability. **24 boats modernized** (entire U-93 class!) with **10.5cm gun upgrade** 1918 - war's final year. **Modernization context**: **U-93 class baseline** (1917-1918): Original armament: 1× 8.8cm SK L/30 deck gun + 16 torpedoes. Excellent torpedo capacity. But 8.8cm gun inadequate against armed merchant cruisers. **Late-war problem**: By 1918, most Allied merchant ships armed with defensive guns (12-pdr, 4-inch). U-boats surfacing to attack with deck guns risked return fire. 8.8cm gun (3.46-inch) insufficient firepower vs. armed merchants. Needed larger gun for surface combat. **Solution**: **10.5cm SK L/45 gun upgrade!** 10.5cm (4.13-inch) more powerful than 8.8cm (3.46-inch). Could engage armed merchants at safer range. Enhanced surface combat effectiveness. **Modernization program 1918**: All 24 U-93 class boats retrofitted with 10.5cm gun. Removed original 8.8cm SK L/30. Installed 10.5cm SK L/45. Secondary 8.8cm gun retained (AA/auxiliary role). **Unchanged capabilities**: Torpedo armament maintained: 6× tubes, 16 torpedoes. Performance unchanged: 16.8 kts surfaced, 9.1 kts submerged. Range unchanged: 9000 nm. Displacement unchanged: 1000 tons surfaced. **Only gun armament enhanced!** **10.5cm SK L/45 specifications**: **Caliber**: 105mm (4.13-inch). **Barrel length**: 45 calibers (4.725m). **Shell weight**: 15.1 kg. **Muzzle velocity**: 785 m/s. **Maximum range**: 12,700 meters. **Rate of fire**: 8-10 rounds/minute. **Effective vs. armed merchants**: Could penetrate merchant hull plating at 8,000+ meters. Outranged most merchant defensive guns (6,000-8,000 meters). Allowed U-boats to engage at safer distance. **Late-war operations**: Modernized U-93 boats operated final months of WWI (1918). Enhanced surface combat capability useful against: **Armed merchant cruisers** (defensive 4-inch guns). **Q-ships** (disguised armed vessels). **Convoy escorts** (sloops, armed trawlers). **But limited impact**: Modernization completed mid-late 1918. WWI ended November 11, 1918 (Armistice). Only 3-6 months operational use! **Tactical changes**: Modernized boats conducted more surface attacks: 10.5cm gun could engage merchants without expending torpedoes. Save torpedoes for warships/valuable targets. Surface gun attack cheaper than torpedo. **But risky!** By 1918, Allied ASW very effective: Aircraft patrols. Destroyer escorts. Depth charges widespread. Surfacing for gun attack dangerous! **Modernization results**: **Limited combat impact**: Only 3-6 months before Armistice. By 1918, convoys well-protected. U-boat effectiveness declining (convoy system working!). Gun upgrade helped, but couldn't reverse strategic situation. **Post-war fate**: **Treaty of Versailles (1919)**: Germany prohibited from maintaining submarines. All U-boats ordered scrapped or surrendered. **U-93 class fate**: All 24 modernized boats scrapped 1919-1920. Some surrendered to Allies (Britain, France). Most scrapped in Germany. None survived post-war. **Historical significance**: U-93 modernization showed **German recognition of changing surface combat requirements**: Armed merchant cruisers required heavier U-boat guns. 8.8cm inadequate by 1918. 10.5cm became standard for subsequent designs (interwar Type IA). **Influenced interwar submarines**: Type IA (1936): 10.5cm SK C/32 gun standard. Type VII (1936-1945): 8.8cm initially, but many refitted with 10.5cm! Type IX (1938-1945): 10.5cm SK C/32 standard from start. U-93 modernization established 10.5cm as **standard German submarine deck gun caliber** through WWII! **Legacy lessons**: **Late-war modernization limited value** (only 3-6 months operational!). **But concept validation important**: Heavier guns necessary for surface combat. 10.5cm caliber optimal for U-boat size/weight constraints. Modernization cheaper than building new boats. **Influenced WWII refits**: Type VIIC Refit (1943): Enhanced AA armament responding to air threat. Type XXI Refit (1945): Post-war improvements. U-93 modernization **first German submarine upgrade program**, established precedent for wartime refits!
