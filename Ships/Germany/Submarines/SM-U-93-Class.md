**Ultimate WWI Ocean-Going U-boat - "Ocean Hunter"!** - 24 boats commissioned 1917-1918: U-93 to U-116. **ULTIMATE WWI OCEAN-GOING U-BOAT!** **Largest WWI U-boat class** (24 boats!). 838 tons surfaced, **4× 50cm torpedo tubes**, **16 torpedoes carried** (UNPRECEDENTED!), 16.8 knots surfaced/8.6 knots submerged. **ULTIMATE 9,000 nm range!** Mixed guns (1× 10.5cm + 1× 8.8cm). **"Ocean Hunter" special ability** (+25% endurance). Culmination of WWI U-boat development. Unrestricted warfare peak effectiveness. Late-war mass production.

**Key Features:** Ultimate WWI U-boat! | 24 boats (largest class!) | 16 torpedoes (unprecedented!) | 9,000 nm range (ultimate!) | Ocean Hunter (+25% endurance) | Mixed guns | Late-war | Culmination of development

**Ships:** 24 boats (U-93 to U-116, commissioned 1917-1918, late WWI operations, many lost in combat, survivors surrendered/scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1917-1920). Late WWI service (1917-1918): **Ultimate ocean-going U-boat** representing culmination of 11 years WWI submarine development (U-31 1914 → U-93 1917). **Largest WWI U-boat class**: 24 boats built despite late-war industrial strain. Germany prioritized U-boat production 1917-1918 when unrestricted submarine warfare nearly won the war. **16 torpedoes unprecedented**: More than double early war boats (U-31: 6 torpedoes). Could sink 8 ships per patrol before needing resupply (2 torpedoes per target). Extended combat effectiveness dramatically. **9,000 nm range**: Could operate from Germany to North Africa, mid-Atlantic, even North American coast. Ultimate endurance for global commerce warfare. **"Ocean Hunter" special ability**: +25% endurance bonus reflects U-93's exceptional operational range and sustained patrol capability. Could hunt Allied convoys for weeks without returning to port. **Unrestricted warfare peak**: U-93 class entered service during peak unrestricted submarine warfare (Feb 1917-Nov 1918). Sank hundreds of Allied merchant ships. Nearly starved Britain before convoy system and US intervention turned tide. **Late-war production**: 24 boats built 1917-1918 despite worsening German industrial conditions. Submarine construction prioritized over surface ships. Many incomplete at war's end. **Combat losses**: Heavy losses 1917-1918 as Allied ASW improved dramatically (convoy system, destroyer escorts, depth charges, aircraft). U-93 sunk February 1918. U-106 sunk October 1917. Many survived war, scuttled/surrendered 1918. **Historical significance**: **Ultimate expression of WWI U-boat** - largest class, most torpedoes, longest range, peak effectiveness. Proved submarines could nearly win war through commerce warfare. **Legacy**: U-93 lessons influenced interwar Type I and WWII Type VII/IX designs. 16-torpedo capacity not matched until Type IX (22 torpedoes). 9,000 nm range exceeded by Type IX (11,000+ nm). Established template for ocean-going attack submarine.
