**WALTER HTP - 25 Knots Submerged! REVOLUTIONARY!** - 4 boats total: V-80 prototype (1940), U-1405 to U-1407 Type XVIIB (1944-1945). **WALTER HTP TURBINE!** Using hydrogen peroxide (HTP) decomposition for propulsion! **25 KNOTS SUBMERGED** (REVOLUTIONARY!). **"High-Speed HTP" special ability (+150% underwater speed, EXPERIMENTAL!)**. **First true high-speed submarine!** 312 tons surfaced, **2× 53.3cm torpedo tubes**, 4 torpedoes, 8.5 knots surfaced/25 knots submerged. **2500 HP Walter turbine** (submerged propulsion!). Streamlined hull (minimal superstructure). Hydrogen peroxide fuel (highly reactive, dangerous!). Experimental status (only 4 boats). Influenced post-war British Explorer-class and Soviet Project 617.

**Key Features:** 25 KNOTS SUBMERGED! (revolutionary!) | Walter HTP turbine! | +150% underwater speed (experimental!) | Hydrogen peroxide fuel | 2500 HP turbine | Streamlined hull | First high-speed submarine | 4 boats only | V-80 prototype 1940 | Influenced post-war designs | Dangerous HTP fuel

**Ships:** 4 boats (V-80 prototype commissioned 1940 experimental trials, U-1405/U-1406/U-1407 Type XVIIB commissioned 1944-1945, limited operations, surrendered 1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1940-1945). WWII service (1940-1945): **REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENTAL PROPULSION!** Type XVII used **Walter hydrogen peroxide (HTP) turbine** - radical departure from conventional diesel-electric submarines. **25 knots submerged** - faster underwater than most surface ships! **High-Speed HTP special ability represents +150% underwater speed over conventional submarines** (Type VIIC: 7.6 kts submerged vs. Type XVII: 25 kts!). **Game-changing concept**: Conventional submarines slow underwater (6-8 knots), fast surfaced (15-18 knots) - forced to surface for speed/range. Type XVII reversed equation: **could outrun surface escorts UNDERWATER**! Revolutionary for submarine warfare. **V-80 prototype**: Developed 1940 by Professor Hellmuth Walter. 46-ton experimental boat tested Walter turbine concept. Achieved **26 knots submerged** in trials! Proved HTP propulsion viable. Germany immediately began Type XVII development. **Walter HTP turbine system**: Hydrogen peroxide (HTP) - H₂O₂ concentration 80%+ (T-Stoff fuel). Decomposition chamber: Catalyst (calcium permanganate) decomposes HTP → superheated steam (450°C) + oxygen. Steam drives turbine → propeller shaft → 25 knots underwater! Closed-cycle system (no exhaust bubbles - stealthier than diesel!). Fuel tank: 9 tons HTP fuel (114 nm range at 25 knots). Auxiliary diesel engine for surface cruising (3,000 nm range). **Type XVIIB production boats**: U-1405, U-1406, U-1407 commissioned 1944-1945. 312 tons surfaced, 357 tons submerged. 137.8 ft long (small - comparable to Type II coastal). 2× bow torpedo tubes, 4 torpedoes. Streamlined hull - minimal superstructure for reduced drag. No deck gun, no AA guns (speed was defense!). **Combat potential**: 25 knots submerged meant Type XVII could: **Outrun destroyers underwater** (destroyer: 20-24 knots surfaced, but slower during ASW operations). **Close on convoys rapidly** without surfacing (approach 100 nm in 4 hours!). **Escape depth charge attacks** (move away from drop zone before detonation). **Pursue fleeing targets** (no surface ship could escape underwater pursuit). **Operational limitations**: **HTP fuel EXTREMELY dangerous**: 80%+ hydrogen peroxide violently reactive! Contact with organic material → spontaneous combustion/explosion! Crew required special training, protective equipment. Several accidents during development. **Limited range**: 114 nm at 25 knots (HTP fuel consumption enormous). 3,000 nm surfaced on diesel (for transit). Meant Type XVII tactical weapon, not strategic ocean-going boat. **Complexity**: HTP decomposition system required careful maintenance. Catalyst degradation, fuel purity critical. Mechanical reliability issues. **Production delays**: Only 3 Type XVIIB boats completed by war's end. Type XVIIG (larger ocean-going variant) cancelled. Germany prioritized Type XXI Elektroboot (simpler, more reliable). **Limited combat service**: U-1405, U-1406, U-1407 commissioned too late for significant combat. Conducted trials and training operations. All surrendered May 1945. U-1407 scuttled. U-1405 and U-1406 captured by Allies. **Post-war influence**: **British Explorer-class (1954-1958)**: Royal Navy studied captured U-1406. Built 2 experimental HTP submarines (HMS Explorer, HMS Excalibur). Proved HTP dangerous, unreliable - both decommissioned 1960s. **Soviet Project 617 (1958)**: USSR studied Walter system. Built experimental HTP submarine S-99. Suffered HTP explosion 1959 - 4 crew killed! Abandoned HTP propulsion. **US research**: Evaluated captured U-1406 technology. Rejected HTP as too dangerous. Focused on nuclear propulsion instead. **Historical significance**: Type XVII represented **first attempt at true high-speed submarine**. Proved underwater speed advantage revolutionary - could change submarine warfare fundamentally. **But HTP propulsion impractical**: Too dangerous, too complex, too limited range. Nuclear propulsion (1954 USS Nautilus) achieved same goal - high underwater speed + unlimited range - WITHOUT dangerous fuel! Type XVII proved CONCEPT (high-speed submarine), but wrong TECHNOLOGY (HTP). **Legacy**: Type XVII Walter turbine influenced **all post-war submarine development**. Showed submarines needed high underwater speed to survive modern ASW. Led directly to: **Nuclear submarines** (achieved 25+ knots submerged safely). **Improved battery technology** (Type XXI concept - high-capacity batteries for short high-speed bursts). **Streamlined hull designs** (Type XXI-style "Guppy" conversions). Type XVII's revolutionary 25-knot underwater speed never matched by diesel-electric submarines - required nuclear power to achieve safely. But V-80's 1940 trials proved concept decades before USS Nautilus!
