**Type VII Minelayer - Enlarged with Mines+Torpedoes** - 6 boats commissioned 1942: U-213 to U-218. Type VII minelayer variant combining **VIIC combat capability + UC-II minelaying heritage**. 965 tons surfaced (**25% larger than VIIC!**), **5× 53.3cm torpedo tubes**, **14 torpedoes carried**, **15× TMA/TMB mines** (5× vertical chutes, 3 mines each!), 16.0 knots surfaced/7.3 knots submerged. **11,000 nm range** (extended for minelaying missions), **30 ft longer** than VIIC (251 ft vs. 220 ft). **Mine+torpedo combination** like WWI UC-II. Strategic minelaying missions. 1× 8.8cm deck gun + AA armament. All 6 boats lost 1944-1945.

**Key Features:** 6 boats (U-213 to U-218) | 965 tons (25% larger!) | 15 mines + 14 torpedoes! | 5× vertical chutes | 11,000 nm range (extended!) | 30 ft longer (251 ft) | Mine-torpedo combined | Strategic minelaying | All lost 1944-1945

**Ships:** 6 boats (U-213 to U-218, commissioned 1942, minelaying and attack missions, all lost in combat 1944-1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1942-1945). WWII service (1942-1945): Type VIID combined Type VIIC combat effectiveness with WWI UC-II minelaying capability. **Only 6 boats built** - limited production reflected specialized minelaying role. Germany prioritized mass Type VIIC attack submarines over specialized variants. **Enlarged design**: 965 tons surfaced (VIIC: 769 tons - 25% increase!). 251 ft long (VIIC: 220 ft - 30 ft longer!). Extra length accommodated 5× vertical mine chutes aft of conning tower. Same beam (20.3 ft) but deeper draft (16.4 ft). **Mine+torpedo armament**: 15× TMA (Torpedomine A) or TMB (Torpedomine B) mines stored in 5× vertical chutes (3 mines per chute). 5× torpedo tubes, 14 torpedoes (same as VIIC). Could lay 15-mine minefields AND attack shipping with torpedoes on same patrol. Recreated WWI UC-II "Mine+Torpedo" (+35% versatility) concept at larger scale. **Extended range**: 11,000 nm range (VIIC: 8,500 nm). Extra fuel capacity for extended minelaying patrols to distant areas (Caribbean, US East Coast, South Atlantic, Indian Ocean). Could reach areas too far for standard VIIC boats. **Strategic minelaying missions**: Type VIID conducted strategic mining operations 1942-1945. Laid minefields off Allied ports (New York, Charleston, Trinidad, Cape Town, Bombay, Colombo). Blocked harbors, shipping lanes, naval bases. Forced Allies to deploy massive minesweeping resources (hundreds of ships, thousands of men). One minefield could disrupt shipping for weeks/months. **Combat effectiveness**: Despite small numbers (6 boats), Type VIID proved highly effective. Laid hundreds of mines that sank/damaged dozens of Allied ships. U-214 laid mines off US East Coast 1942 - sank 3 merchantmen. U-217 mined South African waters 1943 - damaged multiple ships. Combined minelaying with torpedo attacks maximized effectiveness. **Combat losses**: ALL 6 Type VIID boats lost 1944-1945! **U-213** sunk July 1942 (depth charge, Bay of Biscay) - first Type VIID loss. **U-214** sunk July 1944 (depth charge, English Channel). **U-215** sunk July 1942 (depth charge, Atlantic). **U-216** sunk October 1942 (depth charge, Atlantic). **U-217** sunk June 1943 (depth charge, Atlantic). **U-218** sunk December 1943 (depth charge, Caribbean). 100% loss rate! Average lifespan: 16 months. Allied ASW decimated specialized boats. **Limited production rationale**: Only 6 Type VIID built despite effectiveness. Germany chose mass-produce Type VIIC attack submarines (577-593 boats!) rather than specialized minelayers. Type VIID 30% larger/more expensive than VIIC for limited minelaying advantage. Standard VIIC boats could carry mines externally if needed (reduced torpedo load). Strategic decision prioritized numbers over specialization. **Historical significance**: Type VIID proved mine-torpedo combination still viable in WWII (70 years after UC-II!). Demonstrated value of specialized submarines for strategic missions. But small numbers (6) meant limited impact compared to massive Type VIIC fleet (577-593). **Legacy**: Type VIID represented final German minelaying submarine design. Post-war submarine forces moved away from specialized minelayers - modern attack submarines carry mines externally when needed. Type VIID showed specialized variants less efficient than multipurpose designs in total war context.
