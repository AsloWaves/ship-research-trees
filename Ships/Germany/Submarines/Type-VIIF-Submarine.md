**Type VII Tanker - Torpedo Transport & Resupply** - 4 boats commissioned 1943: U-1059 to U-1062. Type VII torpedo transport variant. 1084 tons surfaced (**40% larger than VIIC!**), **5× 53.3cm torpedo tubes**, **14 torpedoes** (own use), **25× spare torpedoes** (for resupplying other U-boats at sea!), 16.9 knots surfaced/8.0 knots submerged. **14,700 nm range** (MAXIMUM Type VII!), **widest beam 24.9 ft** (cargo space). **Resupplied other U-boats at sea** - extended patrol duration +100%! Compensated for Type XIV Milchkuh tanker losses. Combined attack + supply capability. All 4 boats lost 1944.

**Key Features:** 4 boats (U-1059 to U-1062) | 1084 tons (40% larger!) | 25 spare torpedoes! | Resupply at sea | 14,700 nm range (MAX Type VII!) | Widest beam (24.9 ft) | Extended patrols +100% | Replaced Type XIV role | All lost 1944

**Ships:** 4 boats (U-1059 to U-1062, commissioned 1943, torpedo transport and resupply missions, all lost in combat 1944)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1943-1944). WWII service (1943-1944): Type VIIF created to resupply frontline U-boats after Allied forces decimated Type XIV Milchkuh tanker fleet (1941-1943). **Only 4 boats built** - emergency response to critical resupply problem rather than planned production. **Enlarged design**: 1084 tons surfaced (VIIC: 769 tons - 40% larger!). 253.9 ft long (VIIC: 220 ft - 33 ft longer!). **Widest beam 24.9 ft** (VIIC: 20.3 ft) to accommodate cargo section. Enlarged saddle tanks and internal cargo spaces for torpedo storage. **Torpedo transport capacity**: **25× spare G7a/G7e torpedoes** stored in enlarged cargo section! Could resupply 2-3 frontline Type VII boats (8 torpedoes each) or 1-2 Type IX boats (12 torpedoes each). Plus own combat load: 5× tubes, 14 torpedoes for self-defense and attacks. Total 39 torpedoes aboard (25 spare + 14 own)! **Resupply mission**: Type VIIF operated as mobile torpedo magazines. Rendezvoused with combat U-boats at sea (mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian Ocean). Transferred torpedoes via external hoists while both submarines surfaced. Dangerous operation - required calm seas, no enemy aircraft/ships nearby. Could resupply fuel, food, spare parts if needed. **Extended patrol duration**: Frontline U-boats resupplied by Type VIIF could extend patrols +100% (2-3 months → 4-6 months). Eliminated need to return to French bases for rearming. Enabled deeper Atlantic penetration and longer station time in hunting areas. Critical capability as Type XIV Milchkuh tankers lost to Allied attacks. **Maximum Type VII range**: **14,700 nm range** - MAXIMUM of all Type VII variants! (VIIA: 6,200, VIIB: 8,700, VIIC: 8,500, VIID: 11,000, VIIF: 14,700). Needed extended range to reach distant rendezvous points and return safely. Could operate throughout entire Atlantic, reach Indian Ocean if needed. **Type XIV connection**: Type VIIF partially replaced Type XIV Milchkuh tanker submarines. Type XIV carried 203 tons extra fuel for resupply but limited torpedo capacity. Allied forces sank most Type XIV boats 1943-1944 (10 of 10 lost!). Type VIIF focused on torpedo resupply rather than fuel, but could carry both. Smaller, less vulnerable than Type XIV (1084 tons vs. 1688 tons). **Limited armament**: No 8.8cm deck gun (removed to save weight for cargo). Only 3.7cm + 2× 2cm Flak for air defense. Relied on speed, diving, and escorting combat U-boats for protection. Avoided combat when possible - too valuable to risk in direct attacks. **Combat losses**: ALL 4 Type VIIF boats lost 1944 in rapid succession! **U-1059** sunk March 1944 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-1060** sunk October 1944 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-1061** sunk September 1944 (depth charge, Atlantic). **U-1062** sunk September 1944 (aircraft, Atlantic). 100% loss rate within 13 months of commissioning! Allied forces prioritized sinking supply submarines - recognized strategic value. **Historical significance**: Type VIIF showed desperation of late-war U-boat operations. Germany losing Atlantic battle by 1943-1944. Type XIV tankers destroyed. Needed emergency resupply capability to keep combat boats operational. Type VIIF stopgap solution but too little, too late. Only 4 boats couldn't support hundreds of frontline U-boats. **Legacy**: Type VIIF represented last Type VII specialized variant. Total Type VII family: 709 boats (VIIA: 10, VIIB: 24, VIIC: 577-593, VIID: 6, VIIF: 4). Type VIIF's torpedo transport concept influenced post-war submarine tender operations. Modern submarine forces use surface tenders rather than submarine transports - Type VIIF proved submarine-to-submarine resupply too vulnerable.
