**Improved Coastal - Extended Range (20 Boats!)** - 20 boats commissioned 1936-1937: U-7 to U-24, U-120, U-121. **MOST NUMEROUS TYPE II VARIANT!** Improved Type IIA with extended range. 279 tons surfaced (slightly larger), **3× 53.3cm torpedo tubes** (all bow), 5 torpedoes carried, 13.0 knots surfaced/7.0 knots submerged. **3,100 nm range** (DOUBLED from IIA 1,600 nm!), 1× 2cm Flak. **Training + combat missions** - extended range enabled early-war combat patrols. Most successful Type II variant. Baltic + North Sea operations.

**Key Features:** 20 BOATS! (most Type II!) | 3,100 nm range (doubled IIA!) | 279 tons (improved) | Training + combat | 7.0 kts submerged (improved) | Extended operations | Most successful Type II | 1936-1937 surge

**Ships:** 20 boats (U-7 to U-24, U-120, U-121, commissioned 1936-1937, training and combat operations, heavy losses 1940-1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1936-1945). Interwar/WWII service (1936-1945): **MOST NUMEROUS TYPE II VARIANT!** 20 Type IIB boats built 1936-1937 during rearmament acceleration. Improved version of Type IIA with key enhancement: **3,100 nm range** (vs. IIA 1,600 nm). Range doubled through increased fuel capacity and hull optimization. 279 tons surfaced (vs. IIA 254 tons). **Dual mission capability**: Unlike pure-training IIA, Type IIB's extended range enabled early-war combat patrols. Operated Baltic Sea (anti-Soviet operations 1941-1945), North Sea (convoy attacks 1939-1940), Norwegian coast (coastal defense 1940-1945). Training mission continued but combat role expanded significantly. **Early WWII operations**: Type IIB participated in opening months WWII (September 1939-1940). North Sea patrols against British coastal shipping. Several successful attacks in British territorial waters. U-9 (IIB) sank 4 ships (11,518 tons). U-13 (IIB) sank 5 ships (15,483 tons). Proved small coastal boats still effective against coastal convoys. **Baltic operations**: After 1940, most Type IIB transferred to Baltic training schools. Trained thousands of U-boat crews for Type VII/IX boats. Some conducted anti-Soviet patrols after Operation Barbarossa (June 1941). Baltic became primary operating area 1941-1945. **Combat losses**: Heavy losses throughout war despite coastal role. 15 of 20 Type IIB lost 1940-1945! U-9 sunk August 1944 (mine, Black Sea). U-13 sunk May 1940 (depth charge, North Sea). U-18 sunk November 1940 (depth charge, English Channel). U-120, U-121 survived war, scrapped 1945. **Historical significance**: **Most successful Type II class** - 20 boats provided perfect balance of training capability and combat utility. Extended range (3,100 nm) enabled realistic operational training. Crews experienced actual combat conditions before transferring to larger boats. **Legacy**: Type IIB proved coastal submarines still valuable for training and limited combat. Influenced Type IIC (8 boats) and Type IID (16 boats) designs. Total Type II family (50 boats) trained most of WWII U-boat force. Without Type IIB's dual training-combat capability, U-boat crew quality would have suffered significantly.
