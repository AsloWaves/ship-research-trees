**COASTAL ELEKTROBOOT - Fastest Submarine Worldwide! 1944!** - 61 boats commissioned 1944-1945: U-2321 to U-2371, U-4701 to U-4712. **FASTEST SUBMARINE WORLDWIDE!** **12.5 KNOTS SUBMERGED** (faster than any submarine globally 1944-1945!). **"Fastest Submarine" special ability (+40% coastal operations, UNIQUE!)**. **61 BOATS BUILT!** Coastal elektroboot applying Type XXI concept to smaller design. 234 tons surfaced (COMPACT!), **2× 53.3cm bow torpedo tubes**, 2 torpedoes, 9.7 knots surfaced/12.5 knots submerged. **14-man crew** (smallest operational crew!). Streamlined single-hull. **6 combat patrols** (more than Type XXI!). **5 merchant ships sunk** (combat success!). Quickest build time (175 days!). Prefabricated modular construction. Influenced post-war coastal submarine designs.

**Key Features:** 12.5 KNOTS SUBMERGED! (fastest worldwide!) | +40% coastal operations (UNIQUE!) | 61 boats! | 234 tons (compact!) | 14-man crew (smallest!) | 6 combat patrols! | 5 ships sunk | 175-day build | Streamlined design | More combat success than Type XXI

**Ships:** 61 boats (U-2321 to U-4712 series, commissioned 1944-1945, 6 combat patrols, sank 5 merchant ships, most surrendered May 1945, several post-war service)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1944-1945), Post-war Allied service (1945-1950s). WWII service (1944-1945): **FASTEST SUBMARINE WORLDWIDE!** Type XXIII represented **coastal elektroboot** applying revolutionary Type XXI concept to smaller, faster, cheaper design. **12.5 knots submerged** - faster underwater than any submarine worldwide 1944-1945! **"Fastest Submarine" special ability reflects +40% improved coastal operations** through high underwater speed in shallow waters. **Coastal elektroboot concept**: Type XXI (1621 tons) excellent ocean-going, but expensive, complex, required large crew (57). Germany needed coastal submarine for: **Baltic Sea operations** (shallow waters, short ranges). **North Sea operations** (British coastal shipping). **English Channel patrols** (quick response, shallow depths). **Harbor approaches** (defensive operations). Type XXIII answered need: **Small** (234 tons - 1/7 Type XXI size!). **Fast** (12.5 kts submerged - faster than Type XXI's 17.2 kts claim!). **Cheap** ($1.5M vs. Type XXI $12M - 8× cheaper!). **Quick to build** (175 days vs. Type XXI 300+ days!). **Small crew** (14 men vs. Type XXI 57 - easier manning). **Streamlined design**: Single-hull streamlined construction (Type XXI used double-hull figure-8). Smooth hull surface, minimal drag. No deck gun, no AA guns (streamlined for speed). Retractable schnorkel. Clean lines optimized for underwater speed. **Enhanced battery capacity**: Double battery capacity vs. Type II coastal submarine. Could sustain 12.5 kts submerged for short bursts. Cruise 4 kts submerged for 194 nm. Shorter endurance than Type XXI, but sufficient for coastal operations (North Sea, Baltic, Channel). **Prefabricated construction**: 3 prefabricated sections built separately. Transported to assembly yard. Final assembly: 175 days (FASTEST German submarine build time!). Simpler than Type XXI (8 sections) - easier production. 61 boats built 1944-1945 despite Allied bombing. **Armament**: Only 2× bow torpedo tubes, 2 torpedoes (no reloads!). Minimal armament reflected coastal role: Single attack mission, return to base reload. Quick turnaround (175-mile radius from base = 3-day patrol). One-shot attack capability - fire 2 torpedoes, evade, return. **Compared to Type XXI**: Type XXIII traded endurance/armament for speed/compactness/cost. Type XXI: 17.2 kts submerged, 7 days endurance, 23 torpedoes, $12M, 118 built, ocean-going. Type XXIII: 12.5 kts submerged, 2 days endurance, 2 torpedoes, $1.5M, 61 built, coastal. **But Type XXIII faster sustained speed!** Type XXI's 17.2 kts short-duration burst. Type XXIII could maintain 12.5 kts longer (smaller size, less drag, optimized coastal operations). **Combat operations**: **6 combat patrols** (3× more than Type XXI's 2 patrols!). Type XXIII entered service February 1945 (3 months before war's end). **6 boats conducted offensive patrols**: **U-2322**: 2 patrols, sank 1 merchant ship (2,878 tons) off Flamborough Head, England, March 1945. **U-2324**: 1 patrol, sank 2 merchant ships (4,437 tons total) off Scotland, April 1945. **U-2326**: 1 patrol, sank 2 merchant ships (5,866 tons total) off Orkney Islands, Scotland, May 1945. **U-2329**: 1 patrol, no sinkings, survived war. **U-2336**: 1 patrol, no sinkings, survived war. **U-2348**: 1 patrol, no sinkings, survived war. **Total: 5 merchant ships sunk (13,181 tons)** - modest success but **MORE combat effectiveness than Type XXI** (0 ships sunk!). Proved Type XXIII viable combat submarine. **Why more successful than Type XXI?**: Simpler design (easier crew training). Coastal operations (shorter distances, quicker deployment). Earlier operational status (February vs. April 1945). Smaller size (easier handling). Specialized coastal role (vs. Type XXI ocean-going complexity). **Combat effectiveness**: British defenses struggled to counter Type XXIII: **12.5 kts underwater** faster than most escort vessels! **Streamlined design** difficult for sonar detection. **Shallow coastal waters** ideal operating environment (Type XXIII optimized for Baltic/North Sea depths). **Quick attacks** - fire 2 torpedoes, escape at 12.5 kts, return to base. British ASW tactics developed for slow Type VII (7.6 kts submerged) ineffective against 12.5-kt Type XXIII! **Post-war evaluation**: **Soviet Union**: Captured several Type XXIII boats. Influenced Project 615 "Quebec"-class (1953-1957): 30 boats. Coastal submarine incorporating Type XXIII streamlined features. **France**: Captured U-2326 (renamed S-116). Tested 1946-1948. Influenced Arethuse-class coastal submarines (1957-1958). **United Kingdom**: Captured U-2326, U-2348. Extensive trials 1945-1948. Influenced post-war coastal submarine programs. **West Germany**: **Bundesmarine Type 205 (1962-1969)**: 12 boats. Coastal submarine descended from Type XXIII concept! Streamlined design, small crew, coastal operations. Type 206 (1973-1975): 18 boats. Further Type XXIII evolution! **Historical significance**: Type XXIII proved **compact elektroboot concept viable**. Showed Type XXI revolutionary features could apply to smaller, cheaper, faster-to-build coastal submarines. **Most combat-successful elektroboot**: 5 ships sunk vs. Type XXI 0 ships. 6 combat patrols vs. Type XXI 2 patrols. Operational February 1945 vs. Type XXI April 1945. **Fastest submarine worldwide 1944-1945**: 12.5 kts submerged exceeded all Allied submarines: US Gato/Balao: 8.75 kts submerged. British T-class: 9 kts submerged. Soviet S-class: 8 kts submerged. Type XXIII held "fastest submarine" title until 1950s nuclear submarines! **Influenced post-war coastal submarines**: West German Type 205/206 direct descendants. Soviet Quebec-class incorporated features. French Arethuse-class used concepts. Type XXIII showed small, fast, streamlined coastal submarine remained viable Cold War concept. **Legacy**: Type XXIII proved elektroboot revolution applied to ALL submarine sizes, not just large ocean-going boats. Compact, fast, cheap coastal submarine influenced designs for 30+ years. More combat success than Type XXI showed simpler designs often more effective than complex revolutionary systems!
