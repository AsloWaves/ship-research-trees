**Small Coastal - Treaty Limitations Compliance** - 6 boats commissioned 1935: U-1 to U-6. First post-Versailles coastal submarine built under treaty limitations. 254 tons surfaced (small for treaty compliance), **3× 53.3cm torpedo tubes** (all bow), **5 torpedoes carried**, 13.0 knots surfaced/6.9 knots submerged. **1,600 nm range** (coastal operations), 1× 2cm Flak (light AA). **Training boats** for future U-boat crews. Maintained German submarine expertise during rearmament period. Based on WWI UB-III coastal heritage. Small, simple, effective.

**Key Features:** First post-Versailles coastal! | 6 boats (U-1 to U-6) | 254 tons (treaty limits) | Training boats | 5 torpedoes (3 tubes) | 1,600 nm coastal range | Maintained expertise | Based on UB-III heritage | Rearmament starting point

**Ships:** 6 boats (U-1 to U-6, commissioned 1935, training and coastal operations, various fates 1940-1944)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1935-1944). Interwar/WWII service (1935-1944): First post-Versailles coastal submarine class. After Treaty of Versailles restrictions ended 1935, Germany began rebuilding submarine fleet. Type IIA designed as small coastal boats complying with remaining treaty limitations while maintaining submarine expertise. **Treaty compliance strategy**: 254 tons surfaced deliberately kept small. Treaty negotiators scrutinized larger boats. Type IIA under threshold for objections. Allowed Germany to restart submarine construction without triggering Allied intervention. Clever diplomatic-technical balance. **Training mission**: Type IIA primary purpose - train crews for future U-boat expansion. 6 boats (U-1 to U-6) operated in Baltic training schools. Thousands of submariners trained on Type IIA before transferring to Type VII/IX combat boats. Critical foundation for 1,156-boat WWII U-boat force. **UB-III heritage**: Type IIA design based on WWI UB-III coastal class (516 tons, 96 boats, "Coastal Master"). Scaled down to 254 tons while retaining UB-III operational concepts. Connected WWI coastal submarine expertise to WWII designs. **Coastal operations**: 1,600 nm range limited to Baltic, North Sea, coastal areas. 3× bow torpedo tubes, 5 torpedoes carried. Light 2cm Flak for air defense. Simple, reliable, effective for coastal defense and training missions. **WWII service**: Limited combat role due to small size and coastal range. Some early-war Baltic patrols, North Sea operations. Primarily remained training boats throughout war. U-1 sunk April 1940 (collision). U-3 to U-6 survived war, scrapped 1945. **Historical significance**: **Critical transitional class** - bridged 17-year gap between WWI UB-III and WWII U-boat force. Maintained German submarine expertise during prohibition years. Trained core of WWII U-boat crews. Without Type IIA training program, rapid Type VII/IX expansion (1939-1944) would have been impossible. **Type II family**: Type IIA led to IIB (20 boats), IIC (8 boats), IID (16 boats) - total 50 Type II boats. All followed IIA training mission concept. Small numbers but huge impact on crew readiness. **Legacy**: Type IIA proved small coastal submarines still valuable for training and coastal defense. Post-WWII navies (including West Germany) continued using small training submarines based on Type II concepts. Maintained submarine skills during peacetime without massive investment.
