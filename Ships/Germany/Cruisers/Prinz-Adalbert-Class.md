  - Both ships lost in WWI (torpedoed by British submarines)
  - Prinz Adalbert: Torpedoed twice (1915), demonstrated armored cruiser vulnerability

**First 21cm-Armed Armored Cruisers** - 2 ships built (1904): Prinz Adalbert, Friedrich Carl. First German armored cruisers with 21cm (8.3-inch) main guns (became standard for later classes). 8,956 tons, 4× 21cm + 10× 15cm guns, 20 knots. Enhanced armor (100-250mm belt). Both lost in WWI to British submarine torpedoes: Prinz Adalbert torpedoed twice (23 Jul 1915, 23 Oct 1915, 672 killed), Friedrich Carl mined/torpedoed (17 Nov 1914, 7 killed). Demonstrated armored cruiser vulnerability to submarines and mines.

**Key Features:** First 21cm main guns (8.3-inch) | Enhanced armor 100-250mm | Both lost WWI (submarine/mine) | Prinz Adalbert: Torpedoed twice

**Ships:** SMS Prinz Adalbert (torpedoed 23 Oct 1915, 672 killed), SMS Friedrich Carl (mined 17 Nov 1914, 7 killed)

**Service:** WWI Baltic operations (1914-1915). Friedrich Carl: Mined in Gulf of Finland 17 Nov 1914 (7 killed). Prinz Adalbert: Torpedoed by British submarine E8 (23 Jul 1915, damaged), torpedoed again by British submarine E8 (23 Oct 1915, sunk, 672 killed, 3 survivors). Both losses demonstrated armored cruiser vulnerability to modern weapons (submarines, mines), contributing to German shift toward light cruiser construction.
