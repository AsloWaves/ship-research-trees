  - Reduced armament (6× 20.3cm vs. 8× 20.3cm) for extended range
  - Cancelled 1940 due to WWII U-boat priority
  - None ever laid down (remained design studies only)
  - Replaced by focus on submarine construction

**Plan Z Heavy Cruiser Program (Cancelled) - Never Built** - Planned class of 12 heavy cruisers under Plan Z naval expansion (1938-1939), all cancelled 1940. 17,400 tons, 6× 20.3cm guns (3× twin turrets), 33 knots. **Revolutionary diesel propulsion** (100,000 HP, 10,000 nm range at 20 knots), unprecedented endurance for commerce raiding. Reduced armament vs. Admiral Hipper class (6 guns vs. 8) for extended range capability. **All 12 ships cancelled 1940** when WWII priority shifted to U-boat construction. None ever laid down. Remained design studies only. Would have been Germany's most capable ocean-going cruisers.

**Key Features:** Plan Z program (12 ships planned, all cancelled 1940) | Diesel propulsion (10,000 nm range) | Never laid down (design study only)

**Ships:** None built (12 planned: P-1 through P-12, all cancelled before naming)

**Service:** Never built. Plan Z (Kriegsmarine expansion program, 1938-1939) called for 12 P-class heavy cruisers to counter British/French cruiser forces and conduct ocean commerce raiding. Design studies completed 1938-1939, contracts not awarded. **Cancelled Sep 1940** when Hitler ordered all capital ship construction stopped in favor of U-boat mass production (Battle of Atlantic priority). None ever laid down. Represented Germany's final heavy cruiser design evolution, emphasizing endurance and ocean-going capability over firepower. Diesel propulsion would have provided unprecedented range for Atlantic commerce raiding operations.
