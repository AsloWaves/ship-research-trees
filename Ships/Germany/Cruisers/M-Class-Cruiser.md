  - Improved Nürnberg design (faster, longer range)
  - First German light cruiser with 36 knots speed (planned)
  - First German cruiser with 8,000 nm range (planned)
  - Enhanced AA armament for fleet air defense
  - Cancelled 1940 due to WWII U-boat priority
  - None ever laid down (remained design studies only)
  - Would have been Germany's ultimate light cruiser design

**Plan Z Light Cruiser Program (Cancelled) - Never Built** - Planned class of 24 light cruisers under Plan Z naval expansion (1938-1939), all cancelled 1940. 8,800 tons, 8× 15cm guns (4× twin turrets), **36 knots** (fastest German cruiser design). Improved Nürnberg design with enhanced speed, range (8,000 nm at 20 knots), and AA armament. **All 24 ships cancelled 1940** when WWII priority shifted to U-boat construction. None ever laid down. Remained design studies only. Would have been Germany's ultimate light cruiser, combining speed, endurance, and firepower.

**Key Features:** Plan Z program (24 ships planned, all cancelled 1940) | 36 knots (fastest German cruiser design) | 8,000 nm range | Never laid down (design study only)

**Ships:** None built (24 planned: M-1 through M-24, all cancelled before naming)

**Service:** Never built. Plan Z (Kriegsmarine expansion program, 1938-1939) called for 24 M-class light cruisers to provide fleet scouting, convoy escort, and trade protection. Design studies completed 1938-1939, improved Nürnberg class with higher speed (36 knots vs. 32 knots) and longer range (8,000 nm vs. 5,700 nm). Enhanced AA armament for fleet air defense. **Cancelled Sep 1940** when Hitler ordered all capital ship construction stopped in favor of U-boat mass production (Battle of Atlantic priority). None ever laid down. Represented Germany's final light cruiser design evolution, emphasizing speed and endurance for ocean operations.
