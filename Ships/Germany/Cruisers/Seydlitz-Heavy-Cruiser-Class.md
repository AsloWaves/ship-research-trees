**Incomplete Heavy Cruiser - Planned Aircraft Carrier Conversion** - Fourth Admiral Hipper-class ship, never completed. 14,050 tons (planned), 8× 20.3cm guns (never installed), 32 knots (planned). Named after famous WWI armored cruiser SMS Seydlitz (Jutland survivor). Construction started 1936, 85% complete when work stopped (1940). **Carrier conversion project** (Weser, 1942-1943): Conversion to auxiliary aircraft carrier planned, superstructure removed, flight deck designed (18 aircraft capacity), work abandoned 1943 due to material/labor shortages. Scuttled at Königsberg (29 Jan 1945, incomplete hull) to avoid Soviet capture. Only Admiral Hipper-class ship never completed.

**Key Features:** Never completed (85% complete) | Planned carrier conversion (Weser project, 1942-1943, 18 aircraft) | Scuttled incomplete Königsberg (29 Jan 1945)

**Ships:** Seydlitz (single ship, fourth Admiral Hipper-class, incomplete, scuttled 29 Jan 1945, raised by USSR, scrapped 1958)

**Service:** Never operational. Construction started Deutsche Werke Kiel (1936), launched 19 Jan 1939, 85% complete when work stopped (1940) due to Kriegsmarine priority shift to U-boats. **Carrier conversion project** (Weser, 1942-1943): Conversion to auxiliary aircraft carrier proposed after Graf Zeppelin cancellation, superstructure removed, flight deck designed (540 ft, 18 aircraft capacity - Bf 109T fighters + Ju 87C dive bombers), work started Bremen, abandoned 1943 due to material/labor shortages and lack of naval air expertise. Incomplete hull scuttled at Königsberg (29 Jan 1945) to prevent Soviet capture. Raised by USSR 1946, towed to Leningrad, scrapped 1958. Most extensively modified Admiral Hipper-class ship, never completed.
