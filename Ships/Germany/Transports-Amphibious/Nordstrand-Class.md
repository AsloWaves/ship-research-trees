**Harbour Tugs** - Nordstrand-class are harbour tugs for German Navy port operations. Multiple ships built 1970s-1980s.

**Key Specs:** 445 tons | 30.37m × 9.10m × 4.80m | 12 kn | 8-10 crew (civilian) | 23 tons bollard pull

**Innovation:** Small harbour tugs built by Orenstein & Koppel for German Navy port operations. Advanced Voith-Schneider propulsion: two Type 24 G II / 165 propellers providing exceptional manoeuvrability in confined harbour spaces. Bollard pull of 23 tons adequate for moving warships in port. Propulsion system: 2× Deutz SBV 6M 628 diesel engines driving Voith-Schneider cycloidal propellers—allows sideways movement, precise positioning, instant direction changes without turning ship. Small crew of 8-10 civilian personnel. Named after Frisian islands and sandbanks (including Nordstrand).

**Design:** Compact design optimized for harbour operations rather than open-ocean towing. Length 30.37m, beam 9.10m provide manoeuvrability in tight harbour basins. Draft 4.80m allows access to most naval piers. Displacement 445 tons—substantially smaller than Type 720 seagoing salvage tugs. Speed 12 knots adequate for harbour/coastal operations. Voith-Schneider propulsion makes these tugs highly effective for assisting warships during docking/undocking operations.

**Service:** Entered service 1970s-1980s supporting German Navy harbour operations at naval bases including Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Flensburg. Primary role: assisting warships during arrival/departure from piers, moving ships within harbour, positioning vessels alongside piers/docks. Essential support vessels for daily naval base operations. Some boats remain in service 2020s. Simple, reliable design requires minimal maintenance. Civilian crews reduce operating costs compared to military-manned vessels.
