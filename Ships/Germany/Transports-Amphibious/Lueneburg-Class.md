**First Bundesmarine Replenishment Ships** - Lüneburg-class (Type 701) were first dedicated replenishment ships for post-war West German Navy. 8 ships 1966-1969.

**Key Specs:** 3,483-3,984 tons | ~75m | 17 kn | 72 crew | 2,442 tonnes diesel oil + 203 m³ fresh water

**Innovation:** First purpose-built fleet replenishment vessels for Bundesmarine. Five subclasses with varying specifications: 701 A (3,770 tons), 701 B/D (3,483 tons, later 3,709 tons after rebuild), 701 C (3,770 tons), 701 E (3,984 tons). Powered by Maybach 872 dual 3,000 PS diesel engines. Designed to support operational deployment of supply units at sea. Lightly armed for defensive purposes: 2× 40mm L/70 Breda twin mounts.

**Design:** Eight ships built 1960s, named after German cities: Lüneburg, Coburg, Freiburg, Glücksburg, Saarburg, Nienburg, Offenburg, Meersburg. Provided diesel fuel and fresh water replenishment for Bundesmarine ships at sea. Small crew of 72 personnel operated ships. Relatively small displacement (under 4,000 tons) suited for supporting coastal/regional naval operations.

**Service:** Operated Cold War era supporting Bundesmarine fleet operations in Baltic/North Sea. Ships served 25-40 years depending on variant. Post-Cold War disposition: Lüneburg transferred to Colombia 1996, Freiburg to Uruguay 2005, Glücksburg to Egypt. Remaining ships decommissioned 1990s-2000s. Replaced by larger Elbe-class (Type 404) replenishment ships 1990s.
