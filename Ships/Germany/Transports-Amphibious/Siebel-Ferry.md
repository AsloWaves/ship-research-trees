**Catamaran Landing Craft** - Siebel Ferry were shallow-draft catamaran landing craft designed by Luftwaffe Colonel Friedrich Siebel. ~400 built 1940-1945. Originally for Operation Sea Lion.

**Key Specs:** 130-170 tons | 21.6-32m | 6.5-8 kn | 60 ton cargo | 120-250 troops | BMW aircraft engines

**Innovation:** Unique catamaran pontoon design using two bridging pontoons connected by steel beams. Rail-transportable—could be completely disassembled and shipped by rail to any theater. Served as transport, heavy flak ship (4× 88mm guns), light flak ship (4× 20mm quad), gunboat, convoy escort, minelayer. Shallow 1.2-1.75m draft enabled beach landings and torpedo immunity. Three main variants: SF 40 (21.6m), SF 41 (24.3m, 250 troops), SF 43 (32m, only 18 built).

**Design:** Two pontoons spaced 6m apart, steel cross-beams, wood-planked deck. Surplus BMW aircraft engines in pontoon ends. Simple construction allowed rapid production at Antwerp from September 1940. Modular design allowed disassembly for rail transport—key advantage over Marinefährprahm.

**Service:** Lake Ladoga 1942 (operational failure—3 lost Oct 22), Black Sea/Sea of Azov (mine losses), Mediterranean Sicily evacuation Aug 1943 (12 ferries helped evacuate 40,000 troops, 51 tanks), English Channel coastal defense, Baltic operations. Luftwaffen-Fährenflotille I-III, Wehrmacht Bau-Btl 86/128, later Kriegsmarine 4th/10th Landungs-Flotillen. T-2 and T-17 transferred to Finland. DB-51 captured by Soviets. No surviving examples preserved.
