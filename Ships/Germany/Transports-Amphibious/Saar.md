**Innovation:** First purpose-built Kriegsmarine U-boat tender. Dedicated workshop facilities for submarine repairs, torpedo storage/handling, fuel bunkers/pumping for sub refueling, accommodation for submarine crews, technical support spaces, supply storage for provisions/spares/ammunition. Established template for systematic U-boat flotilla support, enabling rapid expansion of Germany's submarine force pre-war and early war years. Influenced later Wilhelm Bauer-class (1940-1943).

Saltzwedel Flotilla (2nd U-boat Flotilla) Wilhelmshaven Oct 1937-1940. Baltic operations Jul 1940-1945 supporting 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th U-boat Flotillas at Pillau/Gotenhafen.

French service Toulon 1949-1971 (23 years active). Target ship Q481 1972-1976 for MM38 Exocet missile development. Sunk by French submarine Doris with E14 torpedo 26 Feb 1976, Mediterranean (42°30'N 5°24'E), depth 2,150m. Total service: 42 years (11 German, 28 French).
