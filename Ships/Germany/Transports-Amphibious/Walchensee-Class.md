**Coastal Tankers** - Walchensee-class (Type 703) were small coastal tankers transporting fuel and fresh water between depots and units. 4 ships 1966-2015.

**Key Specs:** 2,191 tons | 74.2m × 11.2m × 4.1m | 12.5 kn | 21 crew (civilian) | 1,100 tons fuel + 60 tons water

**Innovation:** Series of four small coastal tankers built by Lindenau-Werft Kiel for German Navy. Designed specifically for coastal and harbour fuel/water transport operations rather than open-ocean replenishment. Single shaft propulsion: 2× MWM diesel engines producing 1,010 kW total. Modest speed of 12.5 knots suitable for short-range coastal operations. Unusual feature: civilian-crewed rather than military personnel. Capacity: 1,100 tons of fuel oil plus 60 tons fresh water—adequate for supplying ships in port or coastal patrol vessels.

**Design:** Four ships named after German lakes. Built mid-1960s for Bundesmarine. Small crew of only 21 civilian personnel operated vessels. Simple, economical design focused on reliable coastal transport rather than combat capability. No armament—operated in safe coastal/harbour waters under shore protection.

**Service:** Operated throughout Cold War and post-reunification era supporting German Navy operations in Baltic Sea and North Sea coastal areas. Transported fuel and fresh water from shore storage facilities to ships in harbour or coastal patrol units. Two ships remained in service until December 2015—remarkable 49-year service life. Post-2015 disposition: 2 decommissioned by 2015 (one sold, one scrapped), 2 remained in service through 2015 then disposed. No replacement class built.
