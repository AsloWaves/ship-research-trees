**Limited Construction** - Inter-War Period (1919-1939) Reichsmarine severely restricted by Treaty of Versailles. Very limited auxiliary vessel construction.

**Key Developments:** Treaty of Versailles (1919) severely limited German naval construction. Reichsmarine extremely small 1919-1935. Few dedicated auxiliary vessels built. Notable exceptions: **Saar** (1934) - first purpose-built U-boat tender. **Tsingtau** (1934) - first purpose-built S-boat tender. Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935) allowed submarine force rebuilding, spurring auxiliary construction.

**Note:** The 1919-1935 period saw minimal German naval auxiliary construction due to Versailles Treaty restrictions limiting fleet to coastal defense forces. Dedicated transport/support vessel program did not resume until mid-1930s rearmament.
