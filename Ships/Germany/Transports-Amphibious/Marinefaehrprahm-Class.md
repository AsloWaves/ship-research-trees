**Largest German Landing Craft** - Marinefährprahm (MFP/"F-Lighter") were Germany's largest and most versatile WWII landing craft. ~700 built 1941-1945. Originally designed for Operation Sea Lion.

**Key Specs:** 200-239 tons | 47-50m | 10.5 kn | 105-140 ton cargo | 200 troops | 3× Deutz diesel | 20-25mm armor

**Innovation:** First German landing craft with retractable bow ramp for direct beach assault. Type D could transport 56-ton Tiger I tanks. Multi-role design served as transport, minelayer (DM variant, 34-54 mines), gunboat (AFP variant, 2× 88mm guns), and convoy escort. Armored wheelhouse/engine room unusual for landing craft. Four main variants (A/B/C/D) plus 141 AFP gunboats converted.

**Design:** Steel riveted/welded construction. Bow ramp for vehicle loading. 2.74-3.29m cargo hold height depending on type. Reliable Deutz truck engines replaced original unreliable BMW aircraft engines. Type A1 variants modified to carry captured Soviet KV-1/KV-2 heavy tanks. Italian license-built 95 Motozattere (MZ).

**Service:** Mediterranean, Baltic, Black Sea, English Channel, Norway 1941-1945. Major operations: Operation Blücher II (Kerch Strait crossing), Taman Peninsula evacuation (239,669 personnel evacuated), Sicily/Tunisia supply runs, Dodecanese campaign, Adriatic convoys. Heavy losses to Allied air/naval attacks 1943-1944. Three sold to Romania 1944. MZ 737 (Italian version) survives at Arsenal of Venice museum—only complete example.
