**Modern Tenders** - Elbe-class (Type 404) are modern replenishment ships/tenders supporting fast attack craft, submarines, and minesweepers. 6 ships 1992-1994, still in service.

**Key Specs:** 3,586 tons | 100.6m × 15.4m × 4.05m | ~16 kn | 105 personnel (50 crew + 35 support + 20 staff)

**Innovation:** Modern post-reunification tender class replacing older Rhein-class (Type 401). Built by Bremer Vulkan, Kröger Werft, and Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyards. Comprehensive support capabilities: fuel, fresh water, food, ammunition, spare parts for squadron operations. Medical station and repair workshop enable forward support without returning to base. Modern communication systems allow operation as squadron flagship. Modular design easily configurable to support different squadron types: fast attack craft, submarines, minesweepers/hunters.

**Design:** All six ships named after German rivers: Elbe (A511), Main (A512), Rhein (A513), Mosel (A514), Werra (A515), Donau (A516). First ship Elbe launched June 1992, commissioned January 1993. Last ship Donau launched March 1994, commissioned November 1994. Larger than predecessor Rhein-class: 3,586 tons vs ~1,500 tons. Greater crew: 105 personnel vs ~40. Enhanced capabilities reflect modern German Navy requirements for sustained forward operations.

**Service:** Entered service 1992-1994 following German reunification. Operate worldwide supporting German Navy squadron operations. Provide mobile logistical base for fast attack craft flotillas, submarine squadrons, mine warfare groups. Enable extended operations without shore support. Medical facilities support personnel health at sea. Workshop capabilities conduct repairs/maintenance away from shipyards. Currently in service 2020s—30+ year service life demonstrates robust design. Remain backbone of German Navy auxiliary support fleet.
