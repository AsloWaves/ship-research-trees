**Future Fleet Tankers** - Type 707 EGV (Einsatzgruppenversorger) are purpose-built large fleet replenishment tankers. 2 ships under construction, delivery 2025+.

**Key Specs:** 20,000+ tons | 173m × 24m × 8m | 20+ kn | 42 crew + 23 embarked | 12,000-15,000 m³ fuel capacity

**Innovation:** First purpose-built large fleet tankers for German Navy since WWII. Replacing converted commercial tankers (Type 704A Rhön-class). Massive displacement over 20,000 tons—largest German Navy auxiliaries ever built. Length 173m, beam 24m, draft limited to 8m for port access. Speed over 20 knots—25% faster than 16-knot Type 704A, enables keeping pace with modern frigate task groups. Enormous fuel capacity: 12,000-15,000 m³ (reports vary). Simultaneous refueling capability: two ships on both sides. Container storage expanded to 20 spaces (vs 2 in Type 704A)—enhanced logistics flexibility. Double hull construction meets modern environmental standards. Crew of 42 plus embarkation capacity for 23 additional personnel.

**Design:** Modern purpose-built design incorporating lessons from decades of Type 704A operations. Keel-laying ceremony for first ship: August 2023 at Rostock NEPTUN WERFT. Second ship construction started 29 Feb 2024 at Meyer Werft, keel laid 25 April 2024. German Navy approved acquisition July 2019. Designed for worldwide deployment supporting task group operations. Draft limited to 8m maintains access to naval bases.

**Service:** Planned delivery 2025+. Will replace aging Type 704A Rhön-class (commissioned 1977). Primary mission: underway replenishment of fuel to German Navy task groups during extended worldwide deployments. Two ships provide redundancy and allow simultaneous support of multiple task groups. Designed for service life extending beyond 2050s—60+ year operational span planned. Represent major investment in German Navy's global power projection capabilities and NATO commitments.
