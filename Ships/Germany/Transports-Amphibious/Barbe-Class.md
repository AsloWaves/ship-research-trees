**Utility Landing Craft** - Barbe-class (Type 520) are small utility landing craft for landing/transporting troops, supplies, equipment, and coastal mine laying. 22 produced 1965-1966, 2 remain.

**Key Specs:** 430 tons | 40m × 8.8m × 2.1m | 11 kn | 17 crew | 150 tons cargo capacity

**Innovation:** First post-war German landing craft class. Built by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft Hamburg. Distinctive front and rear door design allows bow/stern loading. Large open cargo deck accommodates vehicles, troops, supplies. Low draft (2.1m) and low profile height enable shallow-water operations and special missions. Armament: 1-2× Rheinmetall MK 20 Rh 202 20mm autocannons, plus mine laying capability for coastal minefield operations. Unique status: only German Navy vessels commanded by Chief Petty Officers rather than commissioned officers.

**Design:** Simple, robust design prioritizing cargo capacity over speed. Propulsion: 750 kW (1,010 hp) diesel providing 11 knots—adequate for coastal/harbour operations. Crew of only 17 personnel. Cargo capacity: up to 150 tonnes—can transport troops, vehicles, artillery, supplies. Multi-role capability: troop landing, supply transport, coastal mine laying.

**Service:** Commissioned 1965-1966, served throughout Cold War supporting Bundesmarine amphibious/coastal operations in Baltic and North Sea. Peak strength: 22 vessels. Most decommissioned 1990s-2000s as capabilities no longer required post-reunification. Two boats remain in service 2020s, one assigned to SEK-M (Spezialeinsatzkommando Marine)—German naval special forces. German Navy plans to procure new landing craft class to replace remaining Type 520 vessels.
