# Innovation
firsts:
  - FIRST GERMAN CARRIER DESIGN! (after treaty restrictions lifted!)
  - "Plan Z Initiative" special ability (+15% capability, UNIQUE!)
  - Anglo-German Naval Agreement (June 1935) lifted carrier ban
  - Grand Admiral Raeder initiated carrier development
  - Ambitious Plan Z naval expansion program
  - 4-carrier fleet envisioned (never realized)
  - Dual-purpose concept (carrier + cruiser armament!)
  - 12-16× 15cm guns (UNIQUE heavy gun armament!)
  - Led directly to Graf Zeppelin construction
  - CONCEPT DESIGN! (evolved into Graf Zeppelin)

**Plan Z Carrier Concept - 1935 Design Initiative!** - 0 boats: **FIRST GERMAN CARRIER DESIGN!** After **Anglo-German Naval Agreement (June 18, 1935)** lifted Versailles carrier restrictions, Grand Admiral Erich Raeder initiated carrier development as part of ambitious **Plan Z naval expansion**. Initial concept: 30,000 tons, 33 kts, **40 aircraft**, unique **dual-purpose design** with **12-16× 15cm guns** (combining carrier and cruiser roles!). Plan Z envisioned **4-carrier fleet** (Graf Zeppelin through Flugzeugträger D). This concept led directly to **Graf Zeppelin** construction (keel laid December 28, 1936). **CONCEPT DESIGN** - evolved into actual carrier program.
