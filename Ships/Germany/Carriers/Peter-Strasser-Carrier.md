contemporary: Graf Zeppelin (sister ship, 85% complete)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - SECOND GRAF ZEPPELIN-CLASS CARRIER!
  - "Halted Construction" special ability (-20% reliability, incomplete, HISTORICAL!)
  - Named after WWI airship commander Peter Strasser
  - Keel laid September 1938 (Germaniawerft, Kiel)
  - Construction halted September 19, 1939 (WWII outbreak!)
  - Only reached armored deck level (~15% complete)
  - Scrapped February 28, 1940 (6 months after halt!)
  - Materials diverted to U-boat construction program
  - U-boat priority ended carrier development
  - Graf Zeppelin-class design (same specifications)
  - 16× 15cm guns dual-purpose concept (planned but never built)
  - EARLY CANCELLATION! (far less complete than Graf Zeppelin)
  - Scrapping marked end of Graf Zeppelin-class program
  - Plan Z carrier C and D never started after this cancellation

**Second Graf Zeppelin-Class - Early Cancellation!** - 1 boat: **PETER STRASSER** (Flugzeugträger B) - **Early construction scrapped 1940!** Second Graf Zeppelin-class carrier with same specifications (33,550 tons, 33.8 kts, 42 aircraft, 16× 15cm guns). **Keel laid September 1938** at Germaniawerft, Kiel. Construction **halted September 19, 1939** (WWII outbreak - strategic priority shift to U-boats!). Only reached **armored deck level** (~15% complete vs. Graf Zeppelin's 85%). **Scrapped February 28, 1940** - materials diverted to U-boat construction program. Named after **Fregattenkapitän Peter Strasser** (1876-1918), Commander of Imperial German Naval Airship Division in WWI, killed in action August 5, 1918 when airship L 70 shot down. Scrapping marked **end of Graf Zeppelin-class program** - Plan Z carriers C and D never started. **NEVER COMMISSIONED!**
