# Innovation
firsts:
  - MODERN CARRIER CONCEPT! (1960 systems integration!)
  - DIGITAL COMBAT SYSTEMS! (early digital fire control!)
  - SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS! (early satcom!)
  - ADVANCED 3D RADAR! (automatic tracking!)
  - AUTOMATED LANDING! (precision approach systems!)
  - 60 modern jet aircraft (Mach 2+ fighters!)
  - F-4 Phantom + A-6 Intruder equivalent capability!
  - AEW aircraft (E-2 Hawkeye equivalent - early warning!)
  - Advanced SAM systems (Terrier/Tartar/Sea Sparrow!)
  - Phalanx CIWS equivalent (last-ditch defense!)
  - Electronic warfare systems (ECM/ESM!)
  - Nuclear strike capability (theoretical!)
  - 68,000 tons (modern supercarrier size)
  - 16,000 nm range (global reach!)
  - Integrated weapons control (digital systems!)
  - PURE SPECULATION! (Germany never pursued carriers!)
  - Cold War Germany focused on land/air/submarine defense
  - NATO carrier groups provided by US
  - Unified Germany (post-1990) had no carrier program
  - THEORETICAL ONLY! (pure alternate history)
