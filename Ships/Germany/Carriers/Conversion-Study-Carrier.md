# Innovation
firsts:
  - FIRST GERMAN CARRIER STUDIES! (post-WWI!)
  - "Early Concepts" special ability (+10% research speed, UNIQUE!)
  - Post-WWI theoretical work despite Versailles Treaty restrictions
  - German naval theorists recognized carrier strategic importance
  - Studied merchant ship conversion concepts
  - Unable to build due to Versailles Treaty limitations
  - Laid foundation for later Plan Z carrier development
  - THEORETICAL ONLY! (no construction)

**Post-WWI Theoretical Carrier Studies!** - 0 boats: **FIRST GERMAN CARRIER STUDIES!** Despite Versailles Treaty restrictions prohibiting aircraft carriers, German naval theorists studied carrier development concepts, recognizing strategic importance of naval aviation. Focused on merchant ship conversion possibilities. Studied British early carriers (HMS Argus 1918). **THEORETICAL ONLY** - Germany unable to build carriers until 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Laid foundation for later Plan Z carrier program.
