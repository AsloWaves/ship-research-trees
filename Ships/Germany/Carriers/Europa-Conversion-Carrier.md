# Europa Conversion Carrier (1942 Theoretical Liner Conversion)

---
class_name: Europa Conversion Carrier (Auxiliary Carrier Concept)
hull_numbers: None (conversion study only)
ships_built: 0 (theoretical conversion)
commissioned: Never
decommissioned: N/A
era: WWII (1942 study)
generation: 7
type: Aircraft Carrier (Conversion Concept)

# Original Ship (SS Europa)
original_name: SS Europa
original_type: Passenger liner (Norddeutscher Lloyd)
original_launched: August 15, 1928
original_tonnage: 49746 GRT
original_dimensions: 938 ft × 102 ft
original_service: Transatlantic passenger service (Bremen-New York)
blue_riband: Held 1930-1933 (fastest Atlantic crossing)

# Specifications (Theoretical Conversion)
displacement_full: 40000 (estimated with conversion)
length_ft: 938 (original liner length)
beam_ft: 102 (original liner beam)
draft_ft: 34 (estimated with conversion weight)
crew: 1200 (estimated)

# Performance (Converted)
speed_design: 27 (original liner speed)
propulsion_type: Steam turbines (original)
propulsion_hp: 130000 (original)
shafts: 4 (original)
range_nm: 5000 (estimated)

# Air Wing (Theoretical Conversion)
aircraft_capacity: 25-30 (estimated for liner conversion)
  fighters: 10-12× Bf 109T
  dive_bombers: 15-18× Ju 87C
flight_deck_length: 650 ft (estimated usable length)
hangar_space: Limited (liner conversion constraints)
elevators: 1-2× aircraft elevators (conversion)

# Armament (Conversion)
main_guns: None (merchant conversion - no heavy guns)
aa_armament: "12× 10.5cm + 20× 3.7cm" (defensive AA only)
armor: Minimal (merchant hull, no armor)

# Technology (Conversion Concept)
flight_deck: Wood plank flight deck over liner superstructure
hangar: Modified passenger decks (limited space)
aircraft_handling: Basic elevator system (conversion)
catapult: 1× catapult (possibly)
arresting_gear: Basic wire system (conversion)

# Conversion Study (1942)
study_date: 1942 (mid-WWII)
study_reason: Graf Zeppelin suspended, no operational carriers
study_result: Studied but never pursued
abandonment_reason: Lack of operational carrier experience, conversion complexity

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Graf-Zeppelin-Carrier]]"
successor: "[[Improved-Graf-Zeppelin-Carrier]]"
contemporary: British merchant carrier conversions (HMS Activity, etc.)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - MERCHANT LINER CONVERSION CONCEPT! (1942 study)
  - SS Europa (49,746 GRT Blue Riband liner!)
  - Famous transatlantic passenger liner (1928-1945)
  - Blue Riband holder 1930-1933 (fastest Atlantic crossing!)
  - Theoretical auxiliary carrier conversion
  - 25-30 aircraft capacity (estimated)
  - 27 knots speed (liner performance!)
  - Studied but never pursued (lack of experience!)
  - Germany lacked operational carrier knowledge for effective conversion
  - British successful with merchant conversions (HMS Activity, etc.)
  - Germany had no carrier doctrine to guide conversion
  - Europa continued as troop transport instead
  - Post-war: Seized by France, became CGT Liberté
  - THEORETICAL ONLY! (conversion never attempted)

**Merchant Liner Conversion - 1942 Theoretical Study!** - 0 boats: **EUROPA CONVERSION** - **Theoretical conversion of famous Blue Riband liner!** SS Europa (49,746 GRT) was legendary transatlantic passenger liner (launched August 15, 1928) that held **Blue Riband 1930-1933** (fastest Atlantic crossing!). Theoretical 1942 conversion study: **40,000 tons**, **27 kts** (original liner speed!), **25-30 aircraft** (10-12 Bf 109T fighters + 15-18 Ju 87C dive bombers). Flight deck over liner superstructure, modified passenger decks as hangars, minimal armor (merchant hull). **Studied but never pursued** - Germany lacked operational carrier experience to guide effective conversion (unlike Britain's successful merchant conversions like HMS Activity). Europa continued as troop transport instead. **THEORETICAL ONLY** - conversion never attempted. Post-war: seized by France, became CGT Liberté passenger liner.
