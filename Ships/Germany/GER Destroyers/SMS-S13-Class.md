**Compact 1911 Program Design - Most Maneuverable** - 12 ships commissioned 1911-1912: S13-S24. Compact variant of 1911 Program "Large Torpedo Boats", more maneuverable than V1/G7 classes. 568 tons, 2× 8.8cm guns, 4× 50cm torpedoes, 32.8 knots. Shorter hull (229.7 ft vs. 236.2 ft) for better agility in torpedo attacks. **12 ships built** (largest 1911 Program class). Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916), North Sea operations. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920.

**Key Features:** Compact design (more maneuverable) | 12 ships built (largest 1911 Program class) | Shorter hull (229.7 ft) | Better agility | Battle of Jutland | Served entire WWI

**Ships:** 12 ships (S13-S24, commissioned 1911-1912, Battle of Jutland participants, survivors scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1911-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service entire war, High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - multiple ships engaged in night torpedo attacks), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations. Compact design made them more maneuverable for night torpedo attacks and close-quarters combat. Several losses from mines, surface engagements. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles. Demonstrated that smaller, more agile destroyers had advantages in North Sea combat conditions despite lower speed than larger V1/G7 classes.
