**Narvik Standard Production - 150mm Gun Mastery** - 3 ships commissioned 1940-1941: Z25, Z26, Z27. **Type 1936A "Narvik Standard"** production ships. Refined Z23 design with **150mm gun mastery** (+35% firepower). 2,610 tons standard, **4× 15cm SK C/38 guns**, **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 39.2 knots. Enhanced AA (9× 20mm), better range (5,100 nm). Served entire WWII: **Arctic convoy operations**, **Battle of Barents Sea** (Z25), Atlantic operations. **Z25 survived**: French Navy service as **Hoche** until 1958! Z26 lost 1942 (Arctic), Z27 lost 1942 (Channel). Proven 150mm destroyer concept.

**Key Features:** Narvik standard (Type 1936A) | 150mm gun mastery (+35%) | Refined design | Enhanced AA (9× 20mm) | Better range (5,100 nm) | Z25 survived to 1958! | Arctic combat | Battle of Barents Sea

**Ships:** 3 ships (Z25/Z26/Z27, commissioned 1940-1941, heavy Arctic/Channel combat: Z26 lost 1942 Arctic, Z27 lost 1942 Channel, Z25 survived → French Hoche 1945-1958)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1940-1945), French Navy (Z25 1945-1958). WWII service (1940-1945): **Arctic convoy operations** (1942-1944 - attacked Allied convoys with devastating 150mm firepower), **Battle of Barents Sea** (31 December 1942 - Z25 engaged British cruisers HMS Sheffield and Jamaica, withdrew after German commander's caution), English Channel operations, Atlantic raids, Norway operations, convoy escort. **150mm gun combat effectiveness**: Outgunned Allied destroyers, could engage light cruisers on equal terms, changed Arctic convoy battles. **Combat losses**: Z26 sunk March 1942 (Arctic - British destroyers), Z27 sunk 1942 (English Channel). **Z25 survival**: Captured 1945, served French Navy as **Hoche** until 1958 - second-longest surviving Narvik destroyer. Demonstrated refined 150mm destroyer concept: better AA than Z23, improved range, proven combat effectiveness. Type 1936A "Narvik Standard" represented maturation of revolutionary 150mm destroyer design.
