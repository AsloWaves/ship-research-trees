**Type 1913 V-Series Variant - Refined Design** - 6 ships commissioned 1914-1915: V43-V48. V-series variant of revolutionary **Type 1913** mass production program. Part of 71-ship V25-class family. 697 tons, **3× 10.5cm guns**, **6× 50cm torpedoes**, 34.2 knots. **Refined V25 design** with improved seakeeping and slightly larger hull for better performance in heavy North Sea conditions. Enhanced range (2,450 nm) for extended operations. Better stability than earlier V-series ships. Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916), North Sea operations. **Many ships survived WWI** (notable among Type 1913 variants). Survivors scrapped 1919-1921 under Treaty of Versailles.

**Key Features:** V-series Type 1913 variant (part of 71-ship program) | Refined V25 design | Improved seakeeping | Enhanced range (2,450 nm) | 6× torpedoes | Many WWI survivors | Battle of Jutland

**Ships:** 6 ships (V43-V48, commissioned 1914-1915, Battle of Jutland participants, many survived WWI, scrapped 1919-1921)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1914-1921). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service entire war, High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - engaged in destroyer actions and night torpedo attacks), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations, convoy escort duties, anti-submarine patrols. Refined design provided excellent seakeeping and reliability throughout war. Several combat losses but many ships survived WWI (notable survival rate compared to earlier destroyer classes). Survivors interned 1918-1919, scrapped under Treaty of Versailles 1919-1921. Part of larger V25-class mass production program (71 ships total) that established German torpedo warfare doctrine and High Seas Fleet destroyer tactics. V43-class demonstrated continuous refinement of Type 1913 design through combat experience and lessons learned.
