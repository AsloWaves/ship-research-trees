test_details: US Army bombers attacked, sunk in 21.5 minutes with 2000-lb bombs
historical_impact: Revolutionized naval warfare, proved airpower effectiveness!
controversy: US Navy disputed results (tests conducted on stationary, unmanned ship)
aviation_milestone: Vindicated Billy Mitchell's advocacy for airpower!

# Battle of Jutland (All 4 Ships)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - FIRST GERMAN 12-INCH GUNS! (30.5cm SK L/50!)
  - SMS OSTFRIESLAND: Billy Mitchell bombing tests (July 21, 1921!)
  - PROVED AIRCRAFT COULD SINK BATTLESHIPS! (revolutionary!)
  - 22,808 tons standard (+21% over Nassau!)
  - 20.5 knots maximum speed (+1 kt improvement)
  - 4 ships built (Helgoland, Ostfriesland, Thüringen, Oldenburg)
  - 12× 30.5cm guns (vs Nassau's 12× 28cm) - larger shells!
  - STILL hexagonal layout (rejected superfiring despite experiments!)
  - Experimented with USS South Carolina-style superfiring, but conservative design prevailed
  - Triple expansion engines (28,000 ihp, +27% power!)
  - Larger torpedo tubes (50cm vs 45cm)
  - Commissioned 1911-1912 (Helgoland first: August 23, 1911)
  - All 4 fought at Battle of Jutland (III Battle Squadron)
  - Helgoland hit once, all survived Jutland
  - Ostfriesland ceded to US as war prize (1920)
  - Mitchell tests: July 21, 1921 - Army bombers sank Ostfriesland in 21.5 minutes
  - 2000-lb bombs proved fatal to battleship (airpower revolution!)
  - Controversy: Navy disputed tests (stationary target, no crew, no countermeasures)
  - Vindicated Billy Mitchell's airpower advocacy (court-martialed 1925 for this advocacy!)
  - Helgoland scrapped 1924, Thüringen scrapped 1923, Oldenburg scrapped 1921
  - Last German dreadnoughts with hexagonal layout (Kaiser class adopted superfiring!)

**Improved German Dreadnought - 1911 Larger Guns, STILL Hexagonal!** - 4 ships: **SMS HELGOLAND**, **SMS OSTFRIESLAND** (Billy Mitchell tests!), SMS Thüringen, SMS Oldenburg. **FIRST GERMAN 12-INCH GUNS!** (30.5cm SK L/50, +25% larger than Nassau!). **22,808 tons**, **20.5 kts**, **12× 30.5cm guns** in **STILL HEXAGONAL LAYOUT** (rejected superfiring despite experiments with USS South Carolina-style!). Improved engines (28,000 ihp, +27% power!). **ALL 4 FOUGHT JUTLAND**, all survived. **SMS OSTFRIESLAND FAMOUS**: Ceded to US 1920, **Billy Mitchell bombing tests July 21, 1921** - US Army bombers **PROVED AIRCRAFT COULD SINK BATTLESHIPS!** (sunk in 21.5 minutes with 2000-lb bombs). **AIRPOWER REVOLUTION!** Vindicated Mitchell's advocacy, changed naval warfare forever! Conservative design kept inefficient hexagonal layout. Scrapped 1921-1924.
