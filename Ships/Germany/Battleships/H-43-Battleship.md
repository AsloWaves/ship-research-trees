# Historical Context - 1943 DISASTER!

# Germany's 1943 Catastrophe
stalingrad_lost: 6th Army destroyed (February 1943)
kursk_disaster: Last offensive failed (July-August 1943)
italy_collapsed: Italy surrendered (September 1943)
u_boat_defeat: U-boat campaign failing (May 1943 "Black May")
air_superiority_lost: Luftwaffe losing daylight air superiority
fuel_crisis: Desperate fuel shortages across all services
manpower_crisis: Running out of trained personnel

# While H-43 Was "Studied"
kursk_battle: Largest tank battle in history - Germany LOST!
hamburg_firestorm: RAF/USAAF destroyed Hamburg (July 1943)
ruhr_bombing: Round-the-clock bombing of Ruhr industrial area
atlantic_defeat: U-boats withdrawn from North Atlantic (May 1943)
eastern_front_collapse: Soviet advances accelerating
study_insanity: Studying 111,000-ton BBs during national collapse!

# Absolute Impossibility

# Construction Fantasy
slipway_required: Would need ~400m slipway (NONE EXISTED!)
slipway_construction: Building slipway alone would take 3+ years!
construction_time: Would require 6+ years minimum (Germany surrendered in 2 years!)
steel_requirements: ~120,000+ tons steel (enough for ~2,000 Panther tanks!)
labor_requirements: ~15,000+ workers for years (impossible!)
germany_production: Germany struggled to produce tanks/aircraft - BBs impossible!

# Operational Fantasy
fuel_requirements: Would consume Germany's ENTIRE monthly fuel production for operations!
germany_fuel_1943: Germany had critical fuel shortages, rationing everything
crew_impossibility: 3,500+ trained sailors (Germany couldn't crew U-boats by 1943!)
port_impossibility: NO port in Germany could handle 111,000-ton ship!
baltic_trap: Far too large for Baltic exits (permanently trapped!)
channel_impossibility: Could NEVER transit English Channel (too shallow!)
air_power_death: RAF/USAAF would sink it in hours (Tallboy bombs available 1943!)

# Resource Comparison - INSANITY!
vs_u_boats: Steel for H-43 = ~200+ Type VII U-boats!
vs_tanks: Steel for H-43 = ~2,000 Panther tanks!
vs_aircraft: Resources = ~10,000+ Bf 109 fighters!
actual_need_1943: Germany desperately needed tanks, aircraft, U-boats - NOT BBs!
speer_quote: Albert Speer would have considered this absolute insanity!

# Hypothetical Analysis (Pure Academic)

# vs Ultimate Battleships
vs_yamato: Much heavier (111,000 vs 72,000 tons), larger guns (20" vs 18.1")
vs_iowa: Almost 2× heavier (111,000 vs 58,000 tons), larger guns (20" vs 16")
vs_montana: Heavier (111,000 vs 71,000 tons), fewer but larger guns
vs_h44: Lighter (111,000 vs 131,000 tons!) - EVEN H-43 wasn't ultimate!

# Fantasy Combat Assessment
firepower: Ultimate (8× 20" guns, 2,200 kg shells)
protection: Ultimate (380mm belt, 480mm turrets, 200mm deck)
speed: Adequate (30 kts)
reality: **WOULD NEVER EXIST** - pure insanity!

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[H-42-Battleship]]"
successor: "[[H-44-Battleship]]" (EVEN LARGER - absolute ultimate!)
contemporary: None - NO nation studied anything this large!
