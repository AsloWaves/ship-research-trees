# Innovation
firsts:
  - First German capital ships with bulbous bow
  - 92% double bottom coverage (best underwater protection)
  - 38cm guns (same caliber as Bayern-class battleships)
  - Most powerful WWI German battlecruiser design
  - Ersatz Yorck ~2-3% complete, Graf Spee 90% complete when scrapped
  - Strategic waste—150-200 million Marks spent, zero operational value

**Germany's Most Advanced WWI Battlecruiser Design (Never Completed)** - 4 ships laid down (1915-1917), 3 launched, **NONE COMPLETED**. 38cm guns (same as Bayern-class battleships), 300mm armor, 92% double bottom, bulbous bow. Ordered 1916 as response to British Renown-class and Jutland lessons. Construction halted 1917-1918 for U-boat priority. SMS Graf Spee 90% complete when scrapped. **Strategic waste**: 150-200 million Marks spent, zero operational value. Scrapped under Versailles Treaty 1920-1922.

**Key Features:** 38cm guns (Bayern caliber) | 92% double bottom | Bulbous bow | Graf Spee 90% complete | Never commissioned

**Ships:** SMS Ersatz Yorck (85% complete), SMS Graf Spee (90% complete), SMS Prinz Eitel Friedrich (60-70% complete), SMS Fürst Bismarck (30-40% complete, never launched)

**Service:** None—never completed. Construction halted 1917-1918 (U-boat priority shift). All scrapped 1920-1922 under Versailles Treaty. Resources could have built 150-200 U-boats. Ersatz Yorck keel laid July 1916, ~1,000-1,100 tons steel assembled (~2-3% complete). Graf Spee closest to commissioning (90% complete) but never launched. Design validated WWI battlecruiser concepts, influenced Nazi Scharnhorst-class (1936) with bulbous bow and single large funnel.
