**Improved Dreadnoughts** - Corrected Nassau's wing turret flaw with superfiring arrangement. 12× 30.5cm guns in 6 twin turrets (2 fore, 2 aft superfiring, 2 midships staggered). Still used reciprocating engines (not turbines). All fought at Jutland. SMS Ostfriesland sunk by Billy Mitchell bombers 1921 (proved air power could sink battleships).

**Key Features:** Superfiring turrets | 30.5cm (12-inch) guns | Still reciprocating engines | SMS Ostfriesland historic air power demonstration

**Ships:** SMS Helgoland, Ostfriesland, Thüringen, Oldenburg

**Service:** Jutland 1916. SMS Ostfriesland most damaged (survived 15-inch hits + torpedo near-miss). Scuttled Scapa Flow 21 June 1919. SMS Ostfriesland sunk by bombers 21 July 1921.
