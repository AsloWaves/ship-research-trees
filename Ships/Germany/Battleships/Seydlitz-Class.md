**Damage Control Masterpiece** - Single-ship class bridging Moltke and Derfflinger. 300mm belt armor, all turrets centerline. Dogger Bank magazine fires (1915) led to fleet-wide anti-flash reforms that saved German battlecruisers at Jutland. **Greatest WWI survival feat:** 22 heavy hits + 1 torpedo + 5,300 tons flooding (21% of displacement), bow underwater, navigated 320 nm to base.

**Key Features:** 300mm belt armor | Greatest damage control feat of WWI | 22 hits + torpedo survived | All centerline turrets

**Ships:** SMS Seydlitz (only ship of class)

**Service:** Dogger Bank (24 Jan 1915): Magazine fires, 165 killed, led to anti-flash reforms. Jutland (31 May 1916): 22 hits + torpedo, 5,300 tons flooding, 98 killed, survived. Scuttled Scapa Flow (21 June 1919), raised 1928, scrapped 1929-1930.
