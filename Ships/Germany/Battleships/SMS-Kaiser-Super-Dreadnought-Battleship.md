mass_sinking: 52 German warships scuttled simultaneously (largest mass scuttling in history!)

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[SMS-Helgoland-Dreadnought-Battleship]]"
successor: "[[SMS-Konig-Super-Dreadnought-Battleship]]"

# Innovation
firsts:
  - **FIRST GERMAN TURBINE BATTLESHIPS!** (Steam turbines!)
  - **SUPERFIRING TURRETS!** (Finally abandoned hexagonal!)
  - TURBINE REVOLUTION! (46,000 shp, +64% power over triple expansion!)

  - 24,724 tons standard (+8% over Helgoland)
  - 5 ships built (Kaiser, Friedrich der Große, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, König Albert)
  - 10× 30.5cm guns in 5× twin turrets (1 bow + 2 wing + 2 superfiring stern!)
  - Learned superfiring from Moltke battlecruiser design
  - Turbine space savings enabled superfiring arrangement
  - Krupp cemented armor (350mm belt, +17% thicker!)
  - Commissioned 1912-1913 (Kaiser first: August 1, 1912)
  - Laid down at Imperial Dockyard Kiel (March 1909)
  - Launched March 22, 1911
  - All 5 fought at Battle of Jutland (III Battle Squadron)

  - Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered mass scuttling
  - Protest against Versailles Treaty and British seizure
  - Friedrich der Große scuttled in 78 feet of water
  - Most salvaged 1930s (Friedrich der Große raised 1937)
  - Revolutionary design: turbines + superfiring = German super-dreadnoughts!
