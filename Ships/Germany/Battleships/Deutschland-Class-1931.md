  - "Pocket battleship" concept (faster than battleships, stronger than cruisers)
  - Battle of River Plate (first major WWII naval battle, Graf Spee vs 3 cruisers)
  - Admiral Scheer's 113,223 GRT record (highest German capital ship raider success)

**Germany's Treaty-Circumventing "Pocket Battleships"** - First capital ships with all-diesel propulsion (10,000 nm range!), built 1931-1936 under Versailles Treaty limits (officially 10,000 tons, actually 16,020 tons = 60% over). 6× 28cm guns, 28 knots. Embodied "faster than anything stronger, stronger than anything faster" concept. Admiral Graf Spee scuttled after Battle of River Plate (Dec 1939, first major WWII naval battle). Admiral Scheer sank 113,223 GRT (highest German capital ship raider total). Deutschland/Lützow torpedoed 1940, limited impact. Revolutionary diesel propulsion proved unsuitable for capital ships (vibration, speed limits).

**Key Features:** All-diesel propulsion (10,000 nm range) | 60% over treaty limit | "Pocket battleship" concept | River Plate (first WWII naval battle)

**Ships:** Deutschland (→ Lützow, Nov 1939), Admiral Scheer, Admiral Graf Spee

**Service:** Graf Spee: Battle of River Plate (13 Dec 1939), scuttled 17 Dec 1939 after fuel damage (Capt. Langsdorff suicide 19 Dec). Admiral Scheer: 113,223 GRT sunk (Oct 1940-Apr 1941, 46,000-nm cruise), sank HMS Jervis Bay + 5 ships (Convoy HX 84), capsized Kiel 9 Apr 1945 (RAF bombing). Deutschland/Lützow: Norway invasion (9 Apr 1940), torpedoed 11 Apr 1940 (HMS Spearfish), limited operations, scuttled 4 May 1945 (Soviet air attack).
