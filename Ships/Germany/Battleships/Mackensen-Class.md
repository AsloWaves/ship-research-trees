**Germany's Unbuilt Super-Battlecruisers** - Most powerful German WWI battlecruiser design. 4 ships laid down (1915-1917), 3 launched, **NONE COMPLETED**. 35cm guns (unique caliber never used elsewhere), 300mm armor, 92% double bottom, bulbous bow. Construction halted 1917-1918 for U-boat priority. SMS Graf Spee 90% complete when scrapped. **Strategic waste:** 150-200 million Marks spent, zero operational value. Scrapped under Versailles Treaty 1920-1922.

**Key Features:** 35cm guns (unique caliber) | 92% double bottom | Bulbous bow | Never completed | Strategic misallocation

**Ships:** SMS Mackensen, SMS Graf Spee, SMS Prinz Eitel Friedrich, SMS Fürst Bismarck

**Service:** None—never completed. Mackensen 85% complete, Graf Spee 90% complete (closest to commissioning), Prinz Eitel Friedrich 60-70% complete, Fürst Bismarck 30-40% complete (never launched). All scrapped 1920-1922 under Versailles Treaty. Resources could have built 150-200 U-boats.
