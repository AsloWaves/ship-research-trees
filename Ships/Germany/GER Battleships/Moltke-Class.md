**Enhanced Battlecruisers** - Evolution of Von der Tann with 10× 28cm guns (+25% firepower) and 270mm armor. SMS Goeben escaped to Turkey (August 1914), bringing Ottoman Empire into WWI—prolonged war by 1-2 years. SMS Moltke survived Jutland (4 hits). Goeben/Yavuz served 62 years (longest dreadnought-era capital ship).

**Key Features:** 10× 28cm guns | SMS Goeben's escape to Turkey | Longest-serving battlecruiser (62 years) | Balanced design

**Ships:** SMS Moltke, SMS Goeben (→ TCG Yavuz Sultan Selim)
