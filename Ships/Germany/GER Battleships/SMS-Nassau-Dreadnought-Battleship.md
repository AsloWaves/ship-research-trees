boats_built: 4
commissioned: 1909-1910
decommissioned: 1919-1924
era: First Dreadnought
generation: 5
type: Battleship (Dreadnought)

# Specifications
displacement_standard: 18873
displacement_full: 21000
length_ft: 479 (146m)
beam_ft: 88.6 (27m)
draft_ft: 27.1 (8.3m)
crew: 963

shafts: 3
boilers: 12 water-tube boilers
coal_capacity_tons: 2700 (plus 200 tons fuel oil)
range_nm: 9400 at 10 knots

# Armament (UNIQUE HEXAGONAL LAYOUT!)
main_guns: "12× 28cm SK L/45 guns" (6× twin turrets - HEXAGONAL ARRANGEMENT!)
hexagonal_layout: "2 forward + 2 aft + 2 port + 2 starboard" (UNIQUE!)
broadside: "8 guns" (same as HMS Dreadnought, but requires 12 guns total!)
forward_aft_fire: "6 guns" (fore/aft firing)
secondary_guns: "12× 15cm SK L/45 guns"
tertiary_guns: "16× 8.8cm SK L/45 guns"
torpedo_tubes: "6× 45cm torpedo tubes"
armor_belt: 300mm (11.8 inches) maximum
armor_deck: 55-80mm
armor_turrets: 280mm (11 inches)
armor_conning_tower: 400mm (15.7 inches)

# Technology (First German Dreadnought!)
gun_layout: HEXAGONAL! (6× twin turrets: 2 bow, 2 stern, 2 port, 2 starboard)
layout_reason: Triple expansion engines consumed internal space → insufficient magazine capacity for centerline superfiring → forced hexagonal distribution!
broadside_comparison: 8 guns on broadside (= HMS Dreadnought), but needs 12 total guns (vs Dreadnought's 10)
armor_scheme: Krupp cemented armor (300mm main belt)
fire_control: Optical rangefinders, centralized fire control
propulsion: Triple expansion reciprocating engines (NOT yet turbines!)
inefficiency: Hexagonal layout inefficient (4 turrets wasted in broadside fire!)

# Historical Significance
first_german_dreadnought: **FIRST GERMAN DREADNOUGHT!** (Response to HMS Dreadnought 1906!)
hexagonal_innovation: Unique hexagonal turret arrangement (forced by engine choice!)
dreadnought_race: Began Anglo-German naval arms race (1909-1914)
kaiserliche_marine: Tirpitz's dreadnought fleet expansion
naval_law: Enabled by Third Naval Law (1906)

# Battle of Jutland (All 4 Ships)
all_four_fought: All 4 Nassau-class fought at Jutland (May 31-June 1, 1916)
nassau_hit: Nassau hit by 11 large-caliber shells, survived
westfalen_service: Westfalen fought entire battle, minor damage
rheinland_service: Rheinland fought throughout, minor damage
posen_service: Posen fought throughout, minimal damage
all_survived: All 4 Nassau-class survived Jutland!

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[SMS-Deutschland-Pre-Dreadnought-Battleship]]"
successor: "[[SMS-Helgoland-Dreadnought-Battleship]]"
contemporary: HMS Dreadnought (1906), HMS Bellerophon (1909), USS South Carolina (1910)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - **FIRST GERMAN DREADNOUGHT!** (October 1, 1909!)
  - **UNIQUE HEXAGONAL TURRET LAYOUT!** (12× 28cm guns in 6× twin turrets!)
  - NECESSITATED BY ENGINE CHOICE! (triple expansion engines consumed magazine space!)
  - 18,873 tons standard displacement (massive leap from 13,191 tons!)
  - 19.5 knots maximum speed (+1.5 kts over Deutschland!)
  - 4 ships built (Nassau, Westfalen, Rheinland, Posen)
  - 12× 28cm guns (vs 4× on Deutschland!) - ALL-BIG-GUN REVOLUTION!
  - 8-gun broadside (same as HMS Dreadnought, but less efficient)
  - Hexagonal layout: 2 forward + 2 aft + 2 port + 2 starboard
  - Triple expansion engines (22,000 ihp) - NOT turbines yet!
  - Krupp cemented armor (300mm belt, 280mm turrets, 400mm conning tower)
  - Commissioned 1909-1910 (Nassau first: October 1, 1909)
  - Laid down July 22, 1907, launched March 7, 1908
  - All 4 fought at Battle of Jutland (I Battle Squadron)
  - Nassau hit 11 times, all 4 survived battle
  - Nassau rammed British destroyer HMS Spitfire (both survived!)
  - Decommissioned 1919-1920 after Treaty of Versailles
  - Nassau scrapped 1920, Westfalen 1924, Rheinland 1920, Posen 1922
  - Inefficient layout (4 wing turrets wasted in broadside engagement)
  - Forced Germany to develop superfiring designs (Helgoland class)
  - Named after Nassau region (lead ship), German provinces
  - Response to HMS Dreadnought sparked Anglo-German naval arms race!

**FIRST GERMAN DREADNOUGHT - 1909 Hexagonal Revolution!** - 4 ships: **SMS NASSAU**, SMS Westfalen, SMS Rheinland, SMS Posen. **FIRST GERMAN DREADNOUGHT!** (Response to HMS Dreadnought 1906 - began Anglo-German naval arms race!). **18,873 tons**, **19.5 kts**, **12× 28cm guns** in **UNIQUE HEXAGONAL LAYOUT** (6× twin turrets: 2 forward, 2 aft, 2 port, 2 starboard!). **ALL-BIG-GUN REVOLUTION!** Hexagonal arrangement **NOT by choice** - triple expansion engines consumed internal magazine space, forcing wing turret placement! 8-gun broadside (same as Dreadnought but requiring 12 total guns - inefficient!). Krupp cemented armor (300mm belt, 400mm conning tower). **ALL 4 FOUGHT JUTLAND** (May 31-June 1, 1916), Nassau hit 11 times and rammed HMS Spitfire, all survived! Inefficiency forced Germany to develop superfiring designs. Scrapped 1920-1924. **REVOLUTIONARY!**
