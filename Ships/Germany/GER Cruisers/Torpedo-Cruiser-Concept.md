  - Maximum torpedo armament (24× 53.3cm tubes, 8× triple mounts)
  - +100% torpedo capability vs. standard light cruiser
  - High speed for torpedo attacks (37 knots)
  - Designed for night surface actions and convoy attacks
  - Light armor for speed and torpedo capacity
  - Design study only (never progressed beyond planning)
  - Reflected emphasis on offensive torpedo warfare

**Torpedo-Armed Light Cruiser (Paper Ship) - Never Built** - Theoretical torpedo cruiser design optimized for offensive torpedo warfare. 6,800 tons, 6× 15cm guns (3× twin turrets), **24× 53.3cm torpedo tubes (8× triple mounts)**, 37 knots. +100% torpedo capability vs. standard light cruiser (24 tubes vs. 12), high speed for night attacks, light armor (50mm belt) for offensive capability. Designed for night surface actions, convoy attacks, destroyer flotilla support. Design study only, never formally proposed. Similar concept to Japanese torpedo cruisers (IJN Ōi, Kitakami). Would have emphasized Kriegsmarine's strength in night combat and torpedo warfare. Reflected emphasis on offensive surface action over defensive roles.

**Key Features:** Maximum torpedo armament (24× 53.3cm tubes, +100% vs. standard) | High speed (37 knots) | Night combat specialist | Offensive warfare emphasis

**Ships:** None (design study only, never formally proposed for construction)

**Service:** Never built. Theoretical design study examining torpedo-armed light cruiser for offensive surface warfare. Proposed maximum torpedo armament: 24× 53.3cm tubes (8× triple mounts, +100% vs. standard 4× triple mounts), high speed (37 knots for attack runs), light armor (50mm belt for displacement efficiency), moderate gun armament (6× 15cm guns). Designed for night surface actions against enemy cruiser/destroyer formations, convoy attacks in darkness, destroyer flotilla support. Advanced torpedo fire control for salvo coordination. Would have emphasized Kriegsmarine's traditional strength in night combat and offensive torpedo warfare. Never formally proposed, remained theoretical exercise exploring specialized offensive cruiser roles. Similar concept to Japanese torpedo cruiser conversions (IJN Ōi, Kitakami - light cruisers with 40× torpedo tubes). Reflected emphasis on offensive surface action doctrine over defensive/escort roles.
