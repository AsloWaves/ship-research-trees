  - Heavier displacement (19,200 tons vs. 14,050 tons)
  - Same armament (8× 20.3cm) but better layout
  - Design study only (never progressed beyond planning)
  - Would have been Germany's most balanced heavy cruiser
  - Reliability penalty (-15% due to theoretical design)

**Enhanced Admiral Hipper Design (Paper Ship) - Never Built** - Theoretical improved Admiral Hipper design, never progressed beyond planning. 19,200 tons, 8× 20.3cm guns (4× twin turrets), 33 knots. Enhanced armor protection (100-120mm belt vs. 70-80mm), longer range (8,000 nm vs. 6,800 nm), heavier displacement (+37% vs. Admiral Hipper). Same main armament but improved layout and protection. Design study only, never officially proposed for construction. Would have been Germany's most balanced heavy cruiser, combining Admiral Hipper's firepower with enhanced protection and endurance. Reliability penalty (-15%) due to theoretical nature.

**Key Features:** Enhanced Admiral Hipper (+37% displacement) | Improved armor (+40% protection) | Longer range (8,000 nm) | Paper design only (never formally proposed)

**Ships:** None (design study only, never formally proposed for construction)

**Service:** Never built. Theoretical design study examining enhancements to Admiral Hipper class based on operational experience. Proposed improvements: Enhanced armor protection (100-120mm belt, 60-80mm deck), longer range (8,000 nm for extended commerce raiding), improved AA armament, better internal subdivision. Maintained 8× 20.3cm main armament but improved layout for better arcs of fire. Never formally proposed for construction, remained theoretical exercise. Would have addressed Admiral Hipper class weaknesses (limited range, thin armor) while preserving firepower. Represented possible postwar cruiser evolution had Plan Z continued.
