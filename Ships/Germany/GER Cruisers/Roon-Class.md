**Improved Armored Cruisers with Thickest Armor** - 2 ships built (1906): Roon, Yorck. Improved design: faster (21.1 knots vs. 20.5), thicker armor (100-280mm belt, thickest for German armored cruisers). 9,533 tons, 4× 21cm + 10× 15cm guns. SMS Yorck: Lost to German mines in Jade estuary (4 Nov 1914, 336 killed), worst German naval accident of WWI. SMS Roon: Survived WWI, Baltic operations, scrapped 1921. Demonstrated peak armored cruiser design before battlecruiser evolution.

**Key Features:** Thickest armor (100-280mm belt) | 21.1 knots (fastest pre-Scharnhorst) | Yorck: Lost to German mines (336 killed, worst accident) | Roon: Survived WWI

**Ships:** SMS Roon (survived WWI, scrapped 1921), SMS Yorck (lost to German mines 4 Nov 1914, 336 killed)

**Service:** WWI High Seas Fleet and Baltic operations (1914-1918). Yorck: Lost to German defensive mines in Jade estuary (4 Nov 1914, 336 killed, worst German naval accident of WWI). Roon: Survived WWI, Baltic operations 1914-1918, training ship 1918-1921, scrapped 1921. Roon-class represented peak German armored cruiser development before Scharnhorst class.
