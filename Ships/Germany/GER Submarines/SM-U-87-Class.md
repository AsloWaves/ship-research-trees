**Advanced Ocean-Going - Improved Reliability & Mixed Guns** - 6 boats commissioned 1916-1917: U-87 to U-92. **Advanced ocean-going U-boat** with improved reliability. 808 tons surfaced, **4× 50cm torpedo tubes**, 8 torpedoes carried (increased!), 16.5 knots surfaced/9.3 knots submerged. **8,700 nm range**, **mixed gun armament** (1× 10.5cm + 1× 8.8cm!), improved reliability diesels (2,400 HP). Enhanced batteries, advanced double hull. **Fewer mechanical breakdowns** extended operational time. Late-war effectiveness.

**Key Features:** Advanced ocean-going | Improved reliability! | Mixed guns (10.5cm + 8.8cm!) | 8 torpedoes (increased) | 8,700 nm range | Enhanced batteries | 6 boats built | Late-war ops

**Ships:** 6 boats (U-87 to U-92, commissioned 1916-1917, WWI Atlantic/North Sea operations, most lost in combat, survivors scrapped 1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1916-1920). WWI service (1916-1918): **Improved reliability** - U-87 class featured refined diesel engines with fewer mechanical failures. Extended operational patrols without breakdowns that plagued earlier classes. Could stay on station longer, sink more ships per patrol. **Mixed gun armament**: 1× 10.5cm SK L/45 main deck gun + 1× 8.8cm secondary gun. 10.5cm provided heavier firepower against armed merchantmen and small warships. 8.8cm for smaller targets, conserving 10.5cm ammunition. More versatile surface combat capability. **Enhanced torpedo capacity**: 8 torpedoes carried (vs. 6-7 earlier classes). More targets per patrol before returning to base. Increased combat effectiveness. **Late-war operations**: U-87 class entered service as Allied anti-submarine warfare improved (convoy systems, destroyer escorts, depth charges). Reliability improvements critical as operations became more dangerous. **Combat losses**: Most U-87 class lost 1917-1918 in intensified ASW environment. U-87 sunk March 1917 (Q-ship attack). U-90 sunk June 1917 (destroyer ramming). U-88 survived war with good record, scrapped 1920. **Historical significance**: Demonstrated maturation of German submarine design - emphasis shifted from raw performance to reliability and sustained operations. Recognized that mechanical failures were as dangerous as enemy action. **Legacy**: Reliability lessons influenced U-93 (ultimate WWI design). Mixed gun armament (heavy + light) became standard on WWII U-boats. Enhanced torpedo capacity trend continued through Type VII (14 torpedoes).
