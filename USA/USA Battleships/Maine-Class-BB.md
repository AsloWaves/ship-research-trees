**Named After Maine** - USS Maine (BB-10) honored USS Maine (ACR-1) lost in Havana Harbor 1898. Solo ship. Improved pre-dreadnought design.

**Key Specs:** 12,846/13,700 tons | 394ft | 18 kn | 4× 12" + 16× 6" guns | 11" belt | Solo ship

**Design:** Larger than predecessors, 12-inch main battery, extensive 6-inch secondary armament. 24 Niclausse boilers (inefficient coal consumption).

**Service:** Commissioned Dec 29, 1902. Participated in Great White Fleet cruise 1907-1908 but forced to leave at San Francisco due to excessive coal consumption from inefficient boilers. Training ship WWI. Decommissioned May 15, 1920, sold for scrap 1922.

**Innovation:** Bridge between early pre-dreadnoughts (13-inch guns) and later designs. Demonstrated need for better boiler efficiency.
