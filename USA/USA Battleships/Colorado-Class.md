**First 16-Inch Guns** - Colorado-class were first US battleships with 16-inch guns. 3 ships (4th Washington cancelled under treaty). "Big Five" with Tennessee-class. Pearl Harbor veterans.

**Key Specs:** 32,600/33,590 tons | 624ft | 21/21.5 kn | 8× 16" guns | 16" belt | First 16-inch | Turbo-electric

**Innovation:** First US 16-inch gun battleships. Eight 16-inch/45 cal guns in four twin turrets. Heaviest broadside until North Carolina. Turbo-electric drive. Washington (BB-47) cancelled under Washington Naval Treaty 1922.

**Design:** Four twin 16-inch turrets. Heavy armor (16-inch belt). Turbo-electric machinery for smooth operation. Similar hull to Tennessee-class. Slow (21 knots) but heavily armed and armored.

**Ships:**
- **Colorado (BB-45)** - WWII Pacific, not at Pearl Harbor
- **Maryland (BB-46)** - Pearl Harbor (light damage), WWII Pacific, Leyte Gulf
- **West Virginia (BB-48)** - Sunk Pearl Harbor, raised, rebuilt, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima, Okinawa

**Service:** Maryland and West Virginia at Pearl Harbor December 1941. West Virginia sunk (refloated and rebuilt). All three saw extensive WWII Pacific service. Battle of Leyte Gulf (last battleship engagement) - West Virginia, Maryland participated. Shore bombardment throughout Pacific. Decommissioned 1947-1959.

**Legacy:** "Big Five" (Tennessee, California, Colorado, Maryland, West Virginia) - most powerful US battleships until North Carolina. 16-inch guns standard for all future US battleships.
