**First Fast Battleships** - North Carolina-class were first US fast battleships. 2 ships. 28 knots to escort carriers. Modern design with radar and fire control. Both museum ships.

**Key Specs:** 35,000/44,800 tons | 729ft | 28 kn | 9× 16" + 20× 5"/38 DP | Heavy AA | Fast battleship | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First treaty battleships under Washington/London treaties. First fast battleships (28 knots vs 21). Designed to escort carriers. Modern fire control radar. Heavy AA armament. Internal protection system.

**Design:** Nine 16-inch/45 cal guns (3× triple turrets). 28 knots from 121,000 shp turbines. Heavy AA battery (20× 5-inch DP, 60× 40mm, 46× 20mm). Advanced fire control with radar. Internal torpedo protection.

**Ships:**
- **North Carolina (BB-55)** - Museum ship Wilmington, NC
- **Washington (BB-56)** - Sunk as target 1960

**Service:** Guadalcanal campaign 1942. Washington sank Japanese battleship Kirishima in naval battle November 1942 (only US battleship vs battleship surface action in Pacific). Carrier escort throughout Pacific. Philippines, Iwo Jima, Okinawa. Both survived war. Washington scrapped 1961. North Carolina preserved as memorial 1961.

**Legacy:** Proved fast battleship concept. 28 knots allowed carrier escort. Template for South Dakota and Iowa classes.
