**Superimposed Turrets** - Kearsarge-class pioneered superimposed turret design with 8-inch guns mounted atop 13-inch turrets. 2 ships. Innovative but flawed design.

**Key Specs:** 11,540/12,850 tons | 375ft | 16 kn | 4× 13" + 4× 8" (superimposed) | 16.5" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First US battleships with superimposed ("two-story") turrets. 8-inch twin turrets mounted directly on top of 13-inch turret structures. Maximized firepower while conserving deck space.

**Design Problems:** Superimposed turrets created operational difficulties. Secondary 5-inch battery mounted too low, frequently washed out in rough seas. Design not repeated successfully.

**Ships:**
- **Kearsarge (BB-5)** - Commissioned Feb 20, 1900, decommissioned 1920
- **Kentucky (BB-6)** - Commissioned May 15, 1900, decommissioned 1920

**Service:** Both participated in Great White Fleet world cruise (1907-1909). Training duties WWI. Decommissioned 1920.

**Legacy:** Proved superimposed turret concept workable but flawed. Later ships used superfiring arrangements instead.
