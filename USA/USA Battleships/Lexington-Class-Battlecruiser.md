**Cancelled Battlecruisers** - Lexington-class were 6 battlecruisers ordered 1916. 8× 16-inch guns, 33+ knots, light armor. Cancelled under Washington Naval Treaty 1922. Lexington (CC-1) and Saratoga (CC-3) converted to aircraft carriers. Others scrapped on slipways.

**Key Specs (Planned):** 43,500/47,000 tons | 874ft | 33.25/35 kn | 8× 16" guns | 7" belt | Battlecruiser | 6 ordered, 2 converted to carriers

**Innovation:** First US ships designed with 16-inch guns. Battlecruiser concept: battleship guns, cruiser speed, light armor. Massive turbo-electric drive (180,000 shp) for 35 knots. Would have been among fastest capital ships.

**Design:** Four twin 16-inch/50 cal turrets (8 guns). Light armor for speed - 7-inch belt vs 13+ inches on battleships. Turbo-electric propulsion for high sustained speed. Secondary battery of 16× 6-inch guns.

**Battlecruiser Concept:**
- **Philosophy:** Speed is armor - outrun anything you can't outfight
- **British influence:** HMS Hood, Renown-class battlecruisers
- **Trade-off:** Heavy guns + high speed = thin armor
- **Vulnerability:** Jutland (1916) showed battlecruiser weakness

**Ships Ordered:**
- **Lexington (CC-1)** - Converted to CV-2, commissioned 1927
- **Constellation (CC-2)** - 24.2% complete, scrapped 1923
- **Saratoga (CC-3)** - Converted to CV-3, commissioned 1927
- **Ranger (CC-4)** - 11.8% complete, scrapped 1923
- **Constitution (CC-5)** - 9.9% complete, scrapped 1923
- **United States (CC-6)** - 3.6% complete, scrapped 1923

**Construction Status at Cancellation (1922):**
- Lexington: 24% complete (hull)
- Saratoga: 27% complete (hull)
- Constellation: 24% complete
- Ranger: 12% complete
- Constitution: 10% complete
- United States: 4% complete

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Limited battleship/battlecruiser construction
- US allowed to complete 2 as aircraft carriers
- Rest cancelled and scrapped
- Saved program cost, got 2 valuable carriers instead

**Conversion to Carriers:**
Lexington and Saratoga converted to carriers 1922-1927:
- Hulls 24-27% complete when conversion started
- Added flight decks, hangars, island superstructure
- Retained turbo-electric machinery (reliable in carrier service)
- 36,000 tons, 888 feet, 33 knots
- Largest carriers until Midway-class (1945)

**What-If as Battlecruisers:**
Had they been completed as battlecruisers:
- 8× 16-inch guns, 35 knots - formidable firepower
- Light armor (7 inches) = vulnerable to battleship fire
- Likely short service life - battlecruiser concept fading
- Probably scrapped 1930s-1940s like other battlecruisers
- Less valuable than as carriers (which both served WWII)

**Comparison to Completed Battleships:**
| Feature | Lexington BC | Colorado BB | Iowa BB |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Main Guns | 8× 16" | 8× 16" | 9× 16" |
| Speed | 35 knots | 21 knots | 33 knots |
| Belt Armor | 7 inches | 16 inches | 12 inches |
| Year | 1922 (planned) | 1923 | 1943 |

**Legacy:**
- Conversion to carriers saved two valuable ships
- Lexington and Saratoga were backbone of pre-WWII carrier force
- Trained generation of naval aviators
- Lexington sunk Battle of Coral Sea (1942)
- Saratoga survived WWII, Bikini tests (1946)
- Better as carriers than they would have been as battlecruisers

**Battlecruiser Concept Obsolescence:**
- WWI Battle of Jutland (1916): 3 British battlecruisers exploded
- Thin armor proved fatal flaw
- By 1920s, battlecruiser concept fading
- Fast battleships (North Carolina, Iowa) superseded concept
- Alaska-class (1944) last US battlecruiser-type ships
