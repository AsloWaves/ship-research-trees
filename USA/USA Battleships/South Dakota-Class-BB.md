**Compact Fast Battleships** - South Dakota-class were compact version of North Carolina with better protection. 4 ships. Shorter hull with heavier armor. Same firepower and nearly same speed.

**Key Specs:** 35,000/44,519 tons | 680ft | 27/27.5 kn | 9× 16" + 16-20× 5"/38 DP | Compact armor | 4 ships

**Innovation:** Compact design - 50 feet shorter than North Carolina but better protected. Inclined armor belt (12.2 inches) more effective than vertical. Weight savings allowed heavier armor on smaller hull. Internal armor scheme.

**Design:** Nine 16-inch/45 cal guns (3× triple). 27 knots from 130,000 shp. Shorter than North Carolina (680 ft vs 729 ft) but better armored. Inclined belt armor. Heavy AA battery. Advanced fire control radar.

**Ships:**
- **South Dakota (BB-57)** - "Battleship X", most decorated, naval battle Guadalcanal
- **Indiana (BB-58)** - Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf
- **Massachusetts (BB-59)** - Museum ship Fall River, MA, North Africa, Pacific
- **Alabama (BB-60)** - Museum ship Mobile, AL, Atlantic and Pacific

**Service:** Guadalcanal naval battles 1942. Battle of Philippine Sea 1944 (Great Marianas Turkey Shoot). Battle of Leyte Gulf 1944. Carrier escort throughout Pacific. Massachusetts shore bombardment Casablanca 1942. All survived war. Three preserved as museums.

**Legacy:** Most efficient fast battleship design. Compact with heavy protection. Massachusetts and Alabama museum ships. South Dakota "Battleship X" most heavily engaged.
