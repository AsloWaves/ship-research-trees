**Cancelled Super Battleships** - South Dakota-class (1920) were 6 super battleships planned post-WWI. 12× 16-inch guns in four triple turrets. Cancelled 1922 under Washington Naval Treaty. Different from WWII South Dakota-class (BB-57).

**Key Specs (Planned):** 43,200/48,500 tons | 684ft | 23 kn | 12× 16" guns (4 triple turrets) | 13.5" belt | CANCELLED

**Innovation:** Four triple 16-inch turrets - 12 guns total. First US battleship design with triple turrets. Would have been most powerful US battleships of 1920s. Heavily armed and armored but relatively slow (23 knots).

**Design:** Four triple 16-inch/50 cal turrets - 2 forward, 2 aft superimposed. Heavy armor (13.5-inch belt). Turbo-electric drive like contemporary ships. Secondary battery of 16× 6-inch guns. Design emphasized firepower and protection over speed.

**Ships Ordered:**
- **South Dakota (BB-49)** - Name ship
- **Indiana (BB-50)**
- **Montana (BB-51)**
- **North Carolina (BB-52)**
- **Iowa (BB-53)**
- **Massachusetts (BB-54)**

**Construction Status at Cancellation:**
- **South Dakota (BB-49):** Keel laid 1920, 11.6% complete
- **Indiana (BB-50):** Keel laid 1920, 10.4% complete
- **Montana (BB-51):** Keel laid 1920, 11.8% complete
- **North Carolina (BB-52):** Keel laid 1920, 8.5% complete
- **Iowa (BB-53):** Keel laid 1921, 6.4% complete
- **Massachusetts (BB-54):** Materials ordered, keel not laid

**Washington Naval Treaty (February 1922):**
- Limited total battleship tonnage per nation
- Cancelled ongoing construction
- 10-year "battleship holiday" - no new battleships
- US scrapped South Dakota-class under treaty
- All work stopped, hulls scrapped on slipways

**Treaty Politics:**
- US had 11 new battleships under construction (6 South Dakota + other classes)
- Britain and Japan also building
- Naval arms race after WWI
- Treaty limited fleets, prevented bankrupting arms race
- US accepted cancellation to achieve treaty limits

**Design Comparison:**
| Feature | Colorado (1923) | South Dakota 1920 (cancelled) | North Carolina 1941 |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Main Guns | 8× 16" (twin) | 12× 16" (triple) | 9× 16" (triple) |
| Displacement | 32,600 tons | 43,200 tons | 35,000 tons |
| Speed | 21 knots | 23 knots | 28 knots |
| Era | Built | Cancelled 1922 | Built |

**What-If Completed:**
Had Washington Treaty not cancelled them:
- Commissioned 1923-1924
- Most powerful US battleships 1920s-1930s
- 12× 16-inch guns unmatched until Iowa-class (1943)
- Slow (23 knots) vs later fast battleships (28-33 knots)
- Probably obsolete by WWII, extensive modernization needed
- Likely served WWII like Colorado-class

**Impact of Cancellation:**
- **Cost savings:** ~$156 million saved (1920s dollars)
- **Treaty compliance:** Enabled Washington Treaty ratification
- **Design lessons:** Triple turret experience incorporated in later ships
- **Gap in fleet:** No new US battleships 1923-1941 (18 years)
- **Next generation:** North Carolina-class (1941) incorporated 20 years of advances

**Name Reuse:**
Several names from 1920 class reused in WWII:
- **South Dakota (BB-57)** - WWII class, different design, commissioned 1942
- **Indiana (BB-58)** - WWII South Dakota-class
- **Massachusetts (BB-59)** - WWII South Dakota-class
- **Iowa (BB-61)** - WWII Iowa-class
- **Montana (BB-67)** - WWII Montana-class (also cancelled 1943)

**Legacy:**
- Last US battleships cancelled in peacetime
- Showed value of naval arms control
- Design influenced later battleships
- Triple turret concept used in North Carolina, South Dakota (1942), Iowa
- Gap until North Carolina allowed incorporation of new technologies

**Comparison to Foreign Designs:**
- **Japanese Tosa-class:** 10× 16" guns, also cancelled under Washington Treaty
- **British G3 battlecruiser:** 9× 16" guns, 32 knots, also cancelled
- **International:** Washington Treaty cancelled ~20 major warships worldwide
