**Extreme Battleship Design Studies** - "Tillman Maximum Battleships" were WWI-era design studies for the largest possible battleships that could use Panama Canal. Up to 24× 16-inch guns in sextuple turrets, or 15× 18-inch guns. 70,000-80,000 tons. Ordered by Senator Tillman to establish "maximum" battleship limits. Navy not seriously interested. Never proceeded beyond paper studies.

**Key Specs (Design IV-2 - Most Extreme):** 70,000-80,000 tons | 975ft | 23-26 kn | 24× 16\" guns OR 15× 18\" guns | DESIGN STUDY ONLY

**Innovation:** Largest battleship designs ever considered by US Navy. Design IV-2 featured 24× 16-inch/50 cal guns in four sextuple (6-gun) turrets - most guns ever on battleship design. Later variants with 15× 18-inch guns in five triple turrets. Sizes limited only by Panama Canal dimensions (975ft × 108ft × 38ft). Never seriously intended for construction.

**Political Origins:**
**Senator "Pitchfork" Benjamin Tillman (D-SC):**
- **Frustration:** Navy requested larger battleships every year
- **Budget creep:** Each class larger and more expensive
- **Unauthorized growth:** Ships significantly larger than Congress authorized
- **Solution:** Force Navy to design "maximum battleship"
- **Logic:** If Navy shows largest possible ship, can't ask for bigger later
- **Order:** Late 1916, Navy to design maximum battleships

**Bureau of Construction & Repair Response:**
- **Reluctance:** Navy not interested in building these monsters
- **Compliance:** Senator Tillman's order, Bureau dutifully produced studies
- **Timeline:** December 1916 - early 1917
- **Focus:** Theoretical exercise, not serious proposals
- **Constraint:** Panama Canal dimensions (1,000ft × 110ft locks)
- **Result:** Four initial designs produced

**Panama Canal Limitation:**
All designs constrained by canal locks:
- **Lock dimensions:** 1,000 feet long × 110 feet wide
- **Practical limits:** 975 feet long × 108 feet wide × 38 feet draft
- **Reason:** Must be able to transit between Atlantic and Pacific
- **Alternative:** Build two separate fleets (unacceptable)
- **Result:** Maximum battleship defined by canal, not technology

**Design Series:**

### **Preliminary Design 171(1) - December 13, 1916:**
- **Displacement:** 70,000 tons
- **Main battery:** 12× 16-inch/50 cal in 4 triple turrets
- **Secondary:** 24× 6-inch guns
- **Speed:** 26.5 knots
- **Armor:** 15-inch belt
- **Layout:** 2 triple turrets forward, 2 aft (all superfiring)
- **Notes:** Most conservative design, similar to South Dakota 1920

### **Preliminary Design 171(2) - December 13, 1916:**
**MOST EXTREME DESIGN:**
- **Displacement:** 70,000 tons
- **Main battery:** 24× 16-inch/50 cal in 4 sextuple turrets
- **Secondary:** 24× 6-inch guns
- **Speed:** 26.5 knots
- **Armor:** 15-inch belt
- **Layout:** 2 sextuple turrets forward, 2 aft
- **Notes:** Most heavily armed battleship ever designed

**Sextuple Turrets:**
- **6 guns per turret:** Unprecedented
- **Weight:** Enormous turret weight
- **Complexity:** Extremely complex loading and fire control
- **Problem:** Technology didn't exist for reliable operation
- **Practical:** Probably never would have worked
- **Result:** Pure theoretical exercise

### **Preliminary Design 171(3):**
- **Displacement:** ~70,000 tons
- **Main battery:** Unknown configuration
- **Notes:** Details less documented
- **Position:** Between designs 1 and 2 in armament

### **Preliminary Design 171(4) - Chosen for Further Development:**
- **Displacement:** 70,000 tons
- **Main battery:** 12× 16-inch/50 cal in 4 triple turrets
- **Speed:** 23 knots (slower, more armor)
- **Armor:** 18-inch belt (heaviest ever)
- **Notes:** Selected for further refinement

**18-Inch Gun Designs (1917):**
Secretary of Navy Josephus Daniels requested 18-inch gun variants:

### **Design IV-1:**
- **Main battery:** 12× 18-inch/48 cal in 4 triple turrets
- **Speed:** 23 knots
- **Armor:** 18-inch belt
- **Notes:** Direct 18-inch upgrade of Design IV

### **Design IV-2:**
- **Main battery:** 15× 18-inch/48 cal in 5 triple turrets
- **Speed:** 23-25 knots
- **Armor:** 18-inch belt
- **Layout:** 3 turrets forward (superfiring), 2 aft
- **Notes:** Most powerful variant

### **Design IV-3:**
- **Main battery:** 9× 18-inch/48 cal in 3 triple turrets
- **Speed:** 25 knots (faster, less armor)
- **Armor:** 15-inch belt
- **Notes:** Speed emphasized over firepower

**18-Inch Guns:**
- **Largest US battleship guns:** Never built beyond these studies
- **Weight:** ~200 tons per gun
- **Shell weight:** 2,900 lbs (vs 2,100 lbs for 16-inch)
- **Problem:** Never developed, would require years of testing
- **Reality:** 16-inch/50 cal remained US Navy standard
- **Foreign:** Japanese Yamato had 18.1-inch (46cm) guns (only ones ever built)

**Comparison to Real Battleships:**
| Ship | Displacement | Main Guns | Speed | Armor | Status |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Tillman IV-2** | 80,000 tons | 15× 18\" | 23 kn | 18\" | Design study |
| Colorado (1923) | 32,600 tons | 8× 16\" | 21 kn | 13.5\" | Built |
| South Dakota 1920 | 43,200 tons | 12× 16\" | 23 kn | 13.5\" | Cancelled |
| Iowa (1943) | 45,000 tons | 9× 16\" | 33 kn | 12.2\" | Built |
| Montana (1943) | 71,000 tons | 12× 16\" | 28 kn | 16\" | Cancelled |
| Yamato (Japan) | 72,000 tons | 9× 18.1\" | 27 kn | 16\" | Built |

**Why Tillman Designs Were Impractical:**

**Firepower Overkill:**
- **24 guns:** More than any ship could effectively control
- **Sextuple turrets:** Technology didn't exist
- **Fire control:** 1916 systems couldn't manage 12-24 guns
- **Salvo density:** More shells ≠ better accuracy
- **Result:** 8-12 guns optimal for era

**Size Problems:**
- **80,000 tons:** Double contemporary battleships
- **Manning:** 1,700+ crew (vs 1,000-1,200 normal)
- **Cost:** Estimated $50-75 million (vs $25M for Colorado)
- **Construction:** No drydock large enough
- **Support:** Existing bases couldn't handle such ships

**Speed Sacrifice:**
- **23-26 knots:** Slower than existing battleships (21 kn standard)
- **Fleet speed:** Can't keep up with fast battleships
- **Tactical:** Slow ships tactically inflexible
- **Doctrine:** US Navy moving toward faster battleships
- **Result:** Speed more important than armor by 1930s

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
Treaty ended all "maximum battleship" considerations:
- **Limits:** 35,000 tons standard displacement
- **Gun limit:** 16-inch maximum caliber
- **Holiday:** 10-year ban on new battleships
- **Cancellations:** South Dakota 1920 cancelled
- **Result:** Tillman designs permanently abandoned

**What-If Tillman Built:**
Had these been built (hypothetically):
- **Commissioned:** 1920-1923 era
- **Problems:** Slow, unwieldy, expensive
- **WWII:** Too slow for fast carrier task forces
- **Firepower:** Massive but hard to aim
- **Vulnerability:** Large target, slow to maneuver
- **Reality:** Iowa-class fast battleships (33 kn) more valuable
- **Verdict:** Good thing they weren't built

**Comparison to Other "Super-Battleship" Concepts:**

**Japanese:**
- **Yamato (built):** 72,000 tons, 9× 18.1-inch guns
- **A-150 (design):** 85,000 tons, 6× 20-inch guns (never built)

**British:**
- **G3 battlecruiser (cancelled):** 48,000 tons, 9× 16-inch, 32 knots
- **N3 battleship (cancelled):** 48,000 tons, 9× 18-inch

**German:**
- **H-class (cancelled):** 56,000-141,000 tons, 8× 16-inch to 8× 20-inch

**Soviet:**
- **Sovetsky Soyuz (incomplete):** 65,000 tons, 9× 16-inch

**Tillman Influence:**
Despite never being built, Tillman studies:
- **Established limits:** Showed maximum practical battleship size
- **Informed debate:** Washington Treaty negotiations
- **Design lessons:** What not to do in battleship design
- **Historical:** Documented WWI-era battleship thinking
- **Entertainment:** Popular in alternate history discussions

**Modern Interest:**
Tillman designs remain popular in:
- **Naval history:** Extreme "what-if" scenarios
- **Alternate history:** Fiction featuring these monsters
- **Video games:** Battleship games feature Tillman designs
- **Models:** Ship modelers build hypothetical versions
- **Academic:** Studies of naval arms races

**Lessons from Tillman:**
1. **Bigger not always better:** Practical limits exist
2. **Cost matters:** Astronomical cost for marginal benefit
3. **Doctrine counts:** Fast battleships more useful than slow monsters
4. **Technology limits:** Sextuple turrets impractical
5. **Treaty value:** Washington Treaty prevented arms race to absurdity

**Senator Tillman's Goal:**
- **Success:** Forced Navy to define maximum battleship
- **Result:** Proved maximum battleship impractical
- **Outcome:** Washington Treaty ended escalation
- **Legacy:** Tillman designs remembered as extreme example

**Legacy:**
"Tillman Battleships" represent:
- Peak of battleship gigantism before reality intervened
- Theoretical limit of 1916 battleship technology
- Warning against uncontrolled arms races
- Historical curiosity - largest US battleships never built
- Reminder that bigger isn't always better
