**10-Gun Dreadnoughts** - Delaware-class were first US dreadnoughts with 10× 12-inch guns. 2 ships. Improved South Carolina design with superfiring turrets.

**Key Specs:** 20,380/22,400 tons | 519ft | 21 kn | 10× 12"/45 (5 twin turrets) | 11" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First US battleships to exceed 20,000 tons displacement. Five twin turrets (2 superfiring forward, 3 aft with back-to-back arrangement). BB-28 Delaware had forced lubrication system (24-hour full-speed capability). BB-29 North Dakota pioneered Curtis direct-drive steam turbines.

**Ships:**
- **Delaware (BB-28)** - Commissioned April 4, 1910, decommissioned Nov 10, 1923, scrapped Feb 1924
- **North Dakota (BB-29)** - Commissioned April 11, 1910, decommissioned Nov 22, 1923, converted to radio-controlled target 1924-1930, scrapped 1931

**Service:** WWI convoy escort duties. Atlantic Fleet operations. Both decommissioned 1923 under Washington Naval Treaty.

**Design:** Improved South Carolina with superfiring turrets and increased firepower. Delaware used reciprocating engines while North Dakota tested turbines. Both used coal-fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers.

**Legacy:** Bridge between 8-gun South Carolina and 12-gun Wyoming classes. Demonstrated viability of 10-gun arrangement.
