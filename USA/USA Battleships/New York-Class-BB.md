**First 14-Inch Guns** - New York-class were first US battleships armed with 14-inch main guns. 2 ships. Marked significant increase in firepower over 12-inch armed predecessors.

**Key Specs:** 27,000/28,367 tons | 573ft | 21 kn | 10× 14"/45 (5 twin turrets) | 12" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First US battleships to mount 14-inch guns, providing superior range and hitting power. Returned to reciprocating engines rather than turbines for fuel economy and reliability. Five twin 14-inch turrets (3 forward superfiring, 2 aft) became standard arrangement for next generation of US battleships.

**Ships:**
- **New York (BB-34)** - Commissioned Apr 15, 1914, decommissioned Aug 29, 1946, sunk as target Jul 8, 1948
- **Texas (BB-35)** - Commissioned Mar 12, 1914, decommissioned Apr 21, 1948, preserved as museum ship at San Jacinto, Texas

**Service:** WWI convoy escort. Both extensively modernized 1925-1927. WWII service included Operation Torch (North Africa), Normandy invasion (June 1944), Iwo Jima (Feb 1945), and Okinawa (Apr-June 1945). New York survived atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll before sinking as target 1948.

**Design:** Conservatively returned to reciprocating engines after turbine experiments. Oil-fired boilers supplemented coal firing. Cage masts characteristic of US dreadnoughts of era. Extensive armor protection with 12-inch belt and heavy turret armor.

**Legacy:** Texas preserved as oldest surviving dreadnought battleship and museum ship. Both ships demonstrated effectiveness of 14-inch guns, influencing all subsequent US battleship designs. Extensive WWII service proved value of older battleships for shore bombardment.
