**Superimposed Turrets** - Virginia-class featured unusual 8-inch turrets mounted atop 12-inch turret structures. 5 ships. All participated in Great White Fleet.

**Key Specs:** 14,948/16,094 tons | 441ft | 19 kn | 4× 12" + 8× 8" (superimposed) | 11" belt | 5 ships

**Design:** Attempted to revive Kearsarge superimposed turret concept with 8-inch guns mounted above 12-inch turrets. Design proved problematic. Largest pre-dreadnoughts when commissioned.

**Ships:**
- **Virginia (BB-13)** - Commissioned May 7, 1906, decommissioned Aug 6, 1920, sunk as target 1923
- **Nebraska (BB-14)** - Commissioned July 1, 1907, decommissioned July 2, 1920, scrapped 1923
- **Georgia (BB-15)** - Commissioned Sept 24, 1906, decommissioned June 15, 1920, scrapped 1923
- **New Jersey (BB-16)** - Commissioned May 12, 1906, decommissioned Aug 6, 1920, sunk by bombing tests Sept 5, 1923
- **Rhode Island (BB-17)** - Commissioned Feb 19, 1906, decommissioned June 30, 1920, scrapped 1923

**Service:** All five ships participated in Great White Fleet world cruise (1907-1909). Training duties WWI. All decommissioned 1920 and disposed of by 1923 per Washington Naval Treaty.

**Innovation:** Last US pre-dreadnought class before all-big-gun dreadnought designs. Superimposed turret arrangement not repeated.

**Legacy:** Represented peak of US pre-dreadnought development. Obsolete by WWI due to dreadnought revolution.
