**Pearl Harbor Survivors** - Tennessee-class both damaged at Pearl Harbor, extensively rebuilt and served entire Pacific War. 2 ships. Final evolution of 14-inch gun super-dreadnoughts.

**Key Specs:** 32,300/33,190 tons | 624ft | 21 kn | 12× 14"/50 (4 triple turrets) | 13.5" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Improved New Mexico design with turbo-electric drive standardized for both ships. Represented peak of 14-inch gun battleship development before switch to 16-inch guns in Colorado-class. Both ships received most extensive reconstructions of any Pearl Harbor survivors, emerging as virtually new ships.

**Ships:**
- **Tennessee (BB-43)** - Commissioned June 3, 1920, damaged at Pearl Harbor (moored inboard of West Virginia), rebuilt 1942-1943, served entire Pacific War, decommissioned Feb 14, 1947
- **California (BB-44)** - Commissioned Aug 10, 1921, sunk at Pearl Harbor (refloated), rebuilt 1942-1944, served entire Pacific War, decommissioned Feb 14, 1947

**Service:** Tennessee moored inboard of West Virginia during Pearl Harbor attack, sustained moderate damage from two bombs and burning oil. California torpedoed and sunk at her berth, settled to harbor bottom but refloated March 1942. Both underwent extensive reconstruction lasting over a year, receiving entirely new superstructures, modern fire control, greatly enhanced anti-aircraft armament, and improved underwater protection. Emerged as most modernized "old" battleships in US fleet. Both served entire Pacific War 1943-1945, participating in virtually every major amphibious operation including Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Marianas, Palau, Philippines (Leyte Gulf), Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.

**Design:** Four triple 14-inch/50 turrets. Turbo-electric drive with eight Bureau Express boilers. Original cage masts replaced by tower masts during 1942-1944 reconstructions. Received most extensive modernizations of any US battleships, with displacement increasing to over 40,000 tons after reconstruction.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated value of extensive reconstruction over scrapping. Both ships among most heavily engaged battleships of Pacific War. California's reconstruction so extensive she didn't return to fleet until January 1944. Represented final development of 14-inch gun battleship before 16-inch Colorado-class.
