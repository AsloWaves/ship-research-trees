**Turbo-Electric Drive** - New Mexico-class introduced turbo-electric drive to US battleships. 3 ships. Improved Pennsylvania design with longer guns and better machinery.

**Key Specs:** 32,000/33,000 tons | 624ft | 21 kn | 12× 14"/50 (4 triple turrets) | 13.5" belt | 3 ships

**Innovation:** New Mexico and Idaho pioneered turbo-electric drive in US battleships, providing better maneuverability and damage resistance. Mississippi built with conventional Curtis turbines for comparison. Longer 50-caliber 14-inch guns improved range and accuracy over 45-caliber weapons. Clipper bow replaced ram bow, improving seakeeping in heavy seas.

**Ships:**
- **New Mexico (BB-40)** - Commissioned May 20, 1918, modernized 1931-1933, served entire Pacific War, decommissioned July 19, 1946, scrapped 1947
- **Mississippi (BB-41)** - Commissioned Dec 18, 1917, modernized 1931-1933, served entire Pacific War, decommissioned Sept 17, 1956, scrapped 1956
- **Idaho (BB-42)** - Commissioned Mar 24, 1919, modernized 1931-1934, served entire Pacific War, decommissioned July 3, 1946, scrapped 1947

**Service:** Commissioned too late for WWI. All three extensively modernized 1931-1934 with improved fire control, anti-aircraft armament, and tripod masts replacing cage masts. Served entire Pacific War from 1941-1945. Participated in virtually every major Pacific campaign including Aleutians, Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Marianas, Palau, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. All three provided extensive shore bombardment support.

**Design:** Turbo-electric drive used steam turbines to drive generators, which powered electric motors connected to propeller shafts. Provided excellent low-speed control and maneuverability. Allowed more flexible machinery arrangement and better subdivision for damage control. Mississippi's conventional turbines used for comparison testing.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated superiority of turbo-electric drive, which became standard for subsequent Tennessee, Colorado, and initial North Carolina designs. All three ships had distinguished WWII service. Mississippi served longest, remaining in commission until 1956 for weapons testing.
