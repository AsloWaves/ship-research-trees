**Cancelled Mini-Carrier** - Sea Control Ship was 1970s proposal for small, affordable helicopter/VSTOL carriers. 17,000 tons, 14 helicopters + 3 Harriers. Part of Admiral Zumwalt's "High-Low" fleet concept. $100-130 million each. Cancelled 1975 by Congress in favor of Nimitz supercarriers. Design sold to Spain and Thailand.

**Key Specs (Proposed):** 13,500/17,000 tons | 610ft | 26 kn | 14 helicopters + 3 Harriers | 705 crew | Conventional propulsion | CANCELLED

**Innovation:** "High-Low" mix concept - supplement expensive supercarriers with cheap mini-carriers. Anti-submarine warfare for convoy protection. VSTOL fighters (AV-8 Harrier) for air defense. Helicopter-focused for ASW. Eight times cheaper than full-size carriers ($100M vs $800M+). Modeled after WWII escort carriers (CVE).

**Admiral Zumwalt's "High-Low" Concept (1970):**
- **High:** Nimitz-class supercarriers (few, expensive, very capable)
- **Low:** Sea Control Ships (many, cheap, adequate capability)
- **Philosophy:** More hulls = more presence worldwide
- **Problem:** Budget constrained, can't afford all supercarriers
- **Solution:** Mix of supercarriers and mini-carriers
- **Congress:** Rejected, chose all-supercarrier fleet

**Design Requirements:**
- **Mission:** Convoy escort and protection
- **Air group:** 14 anti-submarine helicopters (SH-2, SH-3)
- **Fighters:** 3 AV-8 Harrier VSTOL for air defense
- **Capability:** Continuous airborne ASW and AEW coverage
- **Speed:** 26 knots (adequate for convoy escort)
- **Range:** 13,000 nm (transatlantic capability)
- **Cost:** $100 million each (1970s dollars)

**Proposed Air Wing:**
- **SH-2 Seasprite:** 8-10 helicopters (ASW, light attack)
- **SH-3 Sea King:** 4-6 heavy helicopters (ASW)
- **AV-8A Harrier:** 3 VSTOL fighters (air defense, attack)
- **Total:** 17 aircraft (vs 80-90 on supercarriers)
- **Operations:** Two ASW + one AEW helicopter airborne continuously

**Mission Profile:**
Primary mission: Protect Atlantic convoys from Soviet submarines
- **Soviet threat:** Large submarine fleet threatened NATO resupply
- **ASW:** Helicopters with sonar and torpedoes hunt submarines
- **AEW:** Airborne early warning helicopters detect Soviet aircraft
- **CAP:** Harriers intercept Soviet Tu-95 Bears shadowing convoys
- **Defensive:** Protect convoys, not power projection

**Comparison to Escort Carriers (CVE):**
SCS concept modeled after WWII escort carriers:
| Feature | CVE (WWII) | SCS (1970s Proposal) |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Displacement | 10,000-11,000 tons | 17,000 tons |
| Aircraft | 20-28 aircraft | 17 aircraft |
| Speed | 17-19 knots | 26 knots |
| Mission | ASW, convoy escort | ASW, convoy escort |
| Cost | Low (merchant hulls) | $100-130M |
| Result | Successful (151 built) | Cancelled |

**USS Guam (LPH-9) Test Platform:**
- **Ship:** Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault ship
- **Role:** Interim Sea Control Ship for testing
- **Tests:** 1970s experiments with SCS concept
- **Aircraft:** AV-8A Harriers and ASW helicopters
- **Results:** Proved concept viable
- **Lesson:** Small carriers could operate VSTOL and helicopters effectively

**Arguments FOR Sea Control Ship:**
1. **Cost:** $100M each vs $800M+ for Nimitz
2. **Numbers:** Build 8 SCS for cost of 1 Nimitz
3. **Presence:** More hulls = more places covered
4. **Convoy protection:** Adequate for escort mission
5. **WWII proven:** CVE concept worked before
6. **Allies:** Foreign navies interested in buying design

**Arguments AGAINST Sea Control Ship:**
1. **Capability gap:** 17 aircraft vs 90 aircraft significant
2. **Power projection:** Can't replace supercarrier for strike missions
3. **Speed:** 26 knots vs 30+ knots for supercarriers
4. **Survivability:** Small carrier vulnerable to damage
5. **False economy:** Still expensive, much less capable
6. **Supercarrier doctrine:** US Navy committed to big carriers

**Cost Growth:**
- **Initial estimate:** $100 million (1970 dollars)
- **Revised estimate:** $130+ million (1973 dollars)
- **Problem:** 30% cost growth before first ship laid
- **Comparison:** Nimitz cost growth also occurring
- **Result:** Cost advantage diminishing

**Congressional Debate (1970-1975):**
- **1970:** Zumwalt proposes SCS as CNO
- **1971-1973:** Studies and hearings
- **Navy divided:** Surface warfare officers supported, aviators opposed
- **Congress skeptical:** Questioned value vs supercarriers
- **1975:** Congress killed SCS program
- **Funding:** Approved additional Nimitz-class instead

**Why SCS Failed:**
1. **Supercarrier doctrine:** US Navy doctrinally committed to large carriers
2. **Cost growth:** $130M+ no longer "cheap"
3. **Capability:** Too limited for power projection
4. **Allies:** NATO allies could provide convoy escorts
5. **Political:** Congress preferred supercarriers
6. **Industrial:** Newport News Shipbuilding lobby for supercarriers

**Foreign Sales:**
Despite US cancellation, design sold successfully:

**Spain - Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias (R-11):**
- **Ordered:** 1977 (based on SCS design)
- **Commissioned:** 1988
- **Displacement:** 17,200 tons
- **Aircraft:** 6-12 AV-8B Harriers + 10-12 helicopters
- **Modifications:** Ski-jump ramp added
- **Service:** 1988-2013 (25 years)
- **Success:** Effective carrier for Spanish Navy

**Thailand - HTMS Chakri Naruebet:**
- **Ordered:** 1992 (based on SCS final blueprints)
- **Commissioned:** 1997
- **Displacement:** 11,486 tons
- **Aircraft:** Originally 6 AV-8S Harriers + helicopters
- **Modifications:** Ski-jump ramp
- **Status:** Still in service (limited operations)

**Comparison to Built Ships:**
| Feature | SCS (Cancelled) | LHA Tarawa (Built) | Nimitz CVN (Built) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Displacement | 17,000 tons | 39,000 tons | 100,000 tons |
| Aircraft | 17 | 20-25 | 80-90 |
| Propulsion | Conventional | Conventional | Nuclear |
| Speed | 26 knots | 24 knots | 30+ knots |
| Cost | $100-130M | $250M+ | $1B+ |
| Mission | Convoy escort | Amphibious assault | Power projection |

**Alternative: LHA Amphibious Ships:**
US Navy built LHA amphibious assault ships instead:
- **Tarawa-class (LHA-1):** 39,000 tons, 1976-1980 (5 ships)
- **Capable:** Could operate Harriers if needed
- **Dual mission:** Amphibious assault + sea control
- **More flexible:** Marines + aviation
- **Doctrine:** Amphibious assault primary, sea control secondary

**Modern Echo - "Lightning Carrier":**
2010s concept revived SCS idea:
- **America-class LHA:** No well deck, aviation-focused
- **F-35B Lightning II:** Replaces Harrier
- **Load out:** 20+ F-35Bs + helicopters
- **Mission:** Forward presence, sea control
- **Reality:** US Marines operate, not pure carriers
- **Result:** Effectively "SCS" concept realized 40 years later

**What-If SCS Built:**
Had Congress approved SCS production:
- Probably 6-10 ships built 1978-1985
- Operated from secondary bases (not supercarrier ports)
- ASW and convoy escort Atlantic/Mediterranean
- Some sold to allies (NATO, Japan, Australia)
- Cold War use: Soviet submarine tracking
- Post-Cold War: Probably retired 1990s-2000s (missions obsolete)
- Cheaper than supercarriers but less flexible
- US Navy likely regrets not having all-supercarrier fleet

**Impact on Allies:**
SCS cancellation affected foreign navies:
- **Spain:** Bought design, built successfully
- **Thailand:** Also bought design
- **UK:** Developed Invincible-class independently
- **Italy:** Giuseppe Garibaldi similar concept
- **Concept validated:** Small carriers work for smaller navies

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Doctrine matters:** US Navy doctrinally committed to supercarriers
- **Cost growth:** "Cheap" ships get expensive quickly
- **Mission clarity:** Need clear role for new ship type
- **Political:** Congress prefers clear choices (all supercarriers)
- **Foreign success:** Concept worked for other navies

**Legacy:**
- Demonstrated US Navy supercarrier commitment
- Design successfully exported (Spain, Thailand)
- Influenced amphibious assault ship design (LHA)
- "Lightning Carrier" concept (2010s) revives idea
- Proves small carriers viable for specific missions
