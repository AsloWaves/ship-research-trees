**Innovation:** First US carrier built as carrier from start (not converted). Smaller than Lexington to maximize numbers under treaty limits. Flush deck, no island initially. Six internal catapults.

**Design:** Small displacement to maximize carrier numbers. No island superstructure initially (added 1942). Thin armor. Flush flight deck. Limited speed. Maximized air group size.
