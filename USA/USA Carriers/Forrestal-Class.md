**First Supercarriers** - Forrestal-class were first purpose-built supercarriers. 4 ships. Angled decks, steam catapults, 60,000+ tons. Set template for all future US carriers.

**Key Specs:** 60,000/78,000 tons | 1,039ft | 33/34 kn | 80-90 aircraft | 260,000 shp | Angled deck | Steam cats | 4 ships

**Innovation:** First carriers with angled flight deck designed-in (vs retrofit). Steam catapults. Deck-edge elevators. Much larger than earlier carriers - "supercarrier." Set template for all future US carriers.

**Design:** Angled deck allows simultaneous launch/recovery. Four steam catapults. Four deck-edge elevators. Enclosed hurricane bow. No armored flight deck (weight savings). Massive fuel and ordnance storage.

**Ships:**
- **Forrestal (CV-59)** - Fire July 1967 killed 134, major damage
- **Saratoga (CV-60)** - Last conventional carrier, decommissioned 1994
- **Ranger (CV-61)** - Pacific fleet
- **Independence (CV-62)** - Atlantic/Mediterranean

**Service:** Vietnam War 1960s-1970s. Forrestal fire 1967 major tragedy. Cold War deployments worldwide. All decommissioned 1993-1998. Supercarrier concept proved highly successful.
