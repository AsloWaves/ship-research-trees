**Cancelled Medium Carrier** - CVV was 1970s proposal for "affordable" medium-sized conventional carriers. 50-60 aircraft, ~60,000 tons. Cheaper than Nimitz nuclear carriers. Build more carriers for same budget. Cancelled - Congress funded Nimitz-class instead.

**Key Specs (Proposed):** 50,000-65,000 tons | 900-950ft | 28-30 kn | 50-60 aircraft | Conventional propulsion | CANCELLED

**Innovation:** "High-Low mix" concept - expensive Nimitz-class supplemented by cheaper medium carriers. More hulls for same budget. Smaller air group but still capable. Conventional propulsion to save costs.

**Concept Origins (1970s):**
- **Cost concerns:** Nimitz-class expensive (~$2B in 1970s dollars)
- **Hull numbers:** Need more carriers but budget constrained
- **Admiral Zumwalt:** CNO pushed for affordable alternatives
- **High-Low mix:** Some Nimitz, some CVV - maximize fleet size

**Design Proposals:**
Multiple designs studied 1970s:
- **58,000-ton design:** 50-60 aircraft, 28 knots, conventional
- **Smaller variant:** 50,000 tons, 40-50 aircraft
- **Hybrid variant:** Some nuclear features
- **Austere version:** Minimal systems to save cost

**Comparison to Nimitz:**
| Feature | CVV (Proposed) | Nimitz (CVN-68) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Displacement | 50,000-65,000 tons | 100,000 tons |
| Aircraft | 50-60 | 80-90 |
| Propulsion | Conventional | Nuclear |
| Speed | 28-30 knots | 30+ knots |
| Cost | ~$1.2B (1970s) | ~$2B (1970s) |
| Crew | 2,500-3,000 | 5,500+ |

**Arguments FOR CVV:**
- **Cost:** Half the price of Nimitz
- **Numbers:** Build 2 CVV for price of 1 Nimitz
- **Flexibility:** More hulls = more presence worldwide
- **Risk:** If one lost, less capability lost
- **Modernization:** Easier to update conventional systems

**Arguments AGAINST CVV:**
- **Capability gap:** 50 aircraft vs 90 aircraft significant
- **Life-cycle costs:** Fuel costs over 50 years expensive
- **Speed/endurance:** Nuclear unlimited range, higher sustained speed
- **Air group:** Smaller air wing less capable
- **False economy:** "Affordable" carrier still expensive, less capable

**Congressional Debate:**
- **1974-1978:** Multiple studies and hearings
- **Navy leadership divided:** Some supported CVV, others opposed
- **Congress:** Ultimately funded Nimitz-class
- **Reasoning:** Better value long-term, don't compromise capability

**Why CVV Failed:**
1. **Life-cycle costs:** Fuel costs over 50 years negated initial savings
2. **Capability:** Navy didn't want smaller, less capable carriers
3. **Industrial base:** Nuclear carrier construction well-established
4. **Strategic:** Large deck carriers proven doctrine
5. **Political:** Congress convinced by Nimitz arguments

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Sea Control Ship (SCS):** Even smaller carrier (~18,000 tons)
- **V/STOL carrier:** Harrier-only carrier
- **LHA modifications:** Amphibious ships as auxiliary carriers
- **All rejected:** Nimitz-class won out

**Impact:**
- **Nimitz production:** 10 ships built 1975-2009
- **No medium carriers:** US committed to large-deck carriers only
- **Concept revival:** Periodically revived in budget debates
- **Modern echo:** America-class LHA (no well deck) as "Lightning Carrier"

**Foreign Adoption:**
Medium carrier concept adopted by other navies:
- **French Charles de Gaulle:** 40,000 tons, nuclear
- **UK Queen Elizabeth:** 65,000 tons, conventional
- **Chinese Type 002:** 60,000+ tons, conventional
- Shows medium carrier concept viable for other nations

**What-If CVV Built:**
Had CVV been built:
- Probably 4-6 ships commissioned 1980s-1990s
- Mix of CVV + Nimitz in fleet
- Smaller air wings limit capability
- Higher fuel costs over time
- Probably retired early 2000s-2010s
- US likely regretting not building all-Nimitz fleet

**Legacy:**
- Demonstrated US commitment to large carriers
- Nimitz-class proved correct choice
- CVV arguments resurface periodically
- Ford-class continues large carrier philosophy
- US doctrine: Quality over quantity in carrier force
