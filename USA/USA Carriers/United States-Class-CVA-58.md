**Cancelled Supercarrier** - United States (CVA-58) was first US supercarrier designed from keel up. Cancelled 1949 after 5 days of construction. Sparked "Revolt of the Admirals" controversy. Would have been nuclear strike carrier.

**Key Specs (Planned):** 65,000/83,200 tons | 1,090ft | 33 kn | 54-70 aircraft | Flush deck | Nuclear strike mission | CANCELLED

**Innovation:** First carrier designed specifically for strategic nuclear bombing mission. Would carry large bombers capable of delivering atomic bombs. Flush deck design (no island superstructure) to maximize deck space. 1,090 feet - longer than Iowa battleships.

**Design:** Revolutionary flush deck with no island (all operations controlled from deck edge). Four steam catapults. Massive elevators for large bombers. Designed to operate P2V Neptune and AJ Savage nuclear bombers. Hangars and elevators sized for 100,000+ lb aircraft.

**Construction:** Keel laid April 18, 1949 at Newport News Shipbuilding. Construction cancelled April 23, 1949 - only 5 days after start. Ship scrapped on slipway. ~$8 million spent before cancellation.

**Cancellation Reasons:**
- **Budget cuts:** Post-WWII defense spending reductions
- **Air Force opposition:** USAF wanted monopoly on nuclear strike
- **B-36 bomber debate:** Air Force pushed long-range bombers vs Navy carriers
- **Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson:** Cancelled project, sided with Air Force
- **Interservice rivalry:** Carriers vs strategic bombers for nuclear mission

**"Revolt of the Admirals" (1949):**
- Navy leadership opposed cancellation
- Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Louis Denfeld testified to Congress
- Navy argued for carrier-based nuclear strike capability
- Air Force argued carriers obsolete, B-36 bombers sufficient
- Congressional hearings exposed interservice conflicts
- Admiral Denfeld relieved as CNO
- Controversy shaped US defense policy for decades

**Impact on Navy:**
- Short-term setback for carrier aviation
- Navy temporarily lost strategic nuclear mission
- **Korean War (1950):** Proved carriers essential - vindicated Navy position
- **Forrestal-class (1955):** Navy eventually built supercarriers anyway
- **A3D Skywarrior:** Navy got nuclear strike aircraft on smaller carriers

**Legacy:**
- Proved need for supercarriers (Forrestal class followed)
- Established carrier role in nuclear deterrence
- Led to Navy nuclear strike capability (A-3 Skywarrior, A-5 Vigilante)
- Design influenced Forrestal-class
- "Revolt of the Admirals" landmark in civil-military relations

**What-If:** Had United States been completed:
- Nuclear strike carrier 1951-1952
- Larger than Forrestal (built 1955)
- Flush deck design might have been modified (island added)
- Korean War would have had supercarrier available

**Comparison to Forrestal (Built 1955):**
- United States: 83,200 tons, 1,090 ft, flush deck
- Forrestal: 78,000 tons, 1,039 ft, island superstructure
- Forrestal incorporated lessons from United States design
