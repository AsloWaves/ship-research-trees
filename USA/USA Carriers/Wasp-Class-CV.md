**Treaty Tonnage Carrier** - Wasp (CV-7) was smaller carrier built to use up remaining tonnage under Washington Naval Treaty. Commissioned 1940. Torpedoed and sunk September 1942.

**Key Specs:** 14,700/21,000 tons | 741ft | 29.5/30 kn | 84 aircraft | 75,000 shp | 8× 5"/38 DP guns

**Innovation:** Smaller carrier design to fit within remaining treaty tonnage limits. Basically a reduced Yorktown. Good air group despite smaller size. Thin armor.

**Design:** Smaller version of Yorktown. Reduced protection and machinery to save weight. Two shafts vs four. Still carried large air group. Weak torpedo defense.

**Service:** Commissioned 1940. Atlantic patrols. Malta ferry missions 1942. Pacific transfer June 1942. Guadalcanal operations. Torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-19 September 15, 1942. Sank after magazine explosion.
