**Next-Generation Carrier** - Gerald R. Ford-class are newest US carriers. EMALS electromagnetic catapults replace steam cats. Advanced automation reduces crew 20%. CVN-78 commissioned 2017.

**Key Specs:** 100,000/112,000 tons | 1,106ft | 30+ kn | 75-90 aircraft | 2× A1B reactors | EMALS | AAG | DBR radar

**Innovation:** Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) replaces steam catapults - more efficient, gentler on aircraft. Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). A1B reactors generate 700% more electrical power than A4W. Dual-Band Radar. 700 fewer crew than Nimitz.

**Design:** EMALS allows launch of heavier and lighter aircraft than steam cats. AAG reduces stress on aircraft. Improved island design. More sortie generation capacity (160 vs 140 per day). 25% less maintenance than Nimitz. 50-year service life.

**Technology:**
- **EMALS:** Electromagnetic catapults vs steam
- **AAG:** Advanced arresting gear
- **A1B reactors:** 300,000 shp, huge electrical generation
- **DBR:** Dual-band radar (X and S-band)
- **Automation:** Reduced crew requirements

**Ships:**
- **Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78)** - Commissioned 2017, operational 2023
- **John F. Kennedy (CVN-79)** - Under construction, delivery 2025
- **Enterprise (CVN-80)** - Under construction, delivery 2028
- **Doris Miller (CVN-81)** - Planned, delivery 2032

**Program:** CVN-78 cost ~$13B. Follow-on ships ~$11-12B each. 10+ ships planned to replace Nimitz-class through 2060s.
