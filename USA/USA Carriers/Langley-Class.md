**First US Carrier** - Langley (CV-1) was the US Navy's first aircraft carrier, converted from the collier Jupiter. Commissioned 1922. Experimental platform that proved carrier aviation concept.

**Key Specs:** 11,500/14,700 tons | 542ft | 15 kn | 36 aircraft | Turbo-electric | Converted collier

**Innovation:** First US carrier. Converted from USS Jupiter (AC-3) collier. Flush flight deck. Coal-fired propulsion. Turbo-electric drive. Proved carrier aviation viable for US Navy.

**Service:** Commissioned 1922. Experimental carrier operations 1922-1936. Converted to seaplane tender (AV-3) 1937. Sunk by Japanese aircraft February 1942 south of Java.

**Legacy:** "Covered Wagon" - Pioneered US carrier operations. Trained first generation of naval aviators. Proved concept led to Lexington and all future carriers.
