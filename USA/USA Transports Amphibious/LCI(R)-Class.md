**Devastating Rocket Bombardment** - LCI(R)-class were rocket ship conversions from LCI(L) hulls providing shore bombardment and suppressive fire support. Substantial numbers converted late 1943 onwards. 504 rockets in single saturation run. First combat: late 1943, New Britain Island.

**Key Specs:** 387 tons | 158.5ft | 14-15 kn | 10× Mk 7 launchers + 504 rockets | 60-70 crew

**Combat Genesis:** Tarawa (November 1943) demonstrated devastating need for close-in suppressive fire during amphibious assaults. Heavy casualties highlighted gap between naval bombardment and troops ashore. Marine Corps adopted LCI rocket ships as integral amphibious doctrine element. First combat use: late 1943, seizure of New Britain Island (New Guinea). Became standard element of Pacific amphibious operations post-Tarawa.

**Rocket Armament:**

**Primary System**:
- **10× Mk 7 rocket launchers**: Mounted in place of side ramps and inside well deck
- **4.5-inch barrage rockets**: 12 rockets per launcher (automatic feed)
- **Total capacity**: 504 rockets (some sources indicate up to 1,000+ rounds)
- **Rate of fire**: Full salvo in approximately 4 seconds
- **Maximum range**: 1,120 yards
- **Effect**: Massive area saturation bombardment, furious psychological barrage

**Alternative Configuration**: Some vessels mounted 6× 5-inch rocket launchers (less common variant)

**Defensive Armament**: 20mm guns retained from base LCI(L) configuration (likely reduced from standard five guns due to rocket installation)

**Conversion Modifications:**
- **Removed**: Side landing ramps (both port and starboard), troop berthing facilities, some internal troop compartments
- **Added**: 10× Mk 7 rocket launcher racks, rocket ammunition magazines (No. 2 Troop Compartment converted), fire control systems for rocket salvoes, extensive ammunition stowage throughout well deck
- **Structural**: Well deck filled with rocket launcher racks and ammunition, former troop compartment converted to rocket magazine

Crew increased from 24 to 60-70 for rocket operations and fire control.

**Tactical Doctrine:**
- **Primary Mission**: Saturation bombardment of beach defenses immediately before assault
- **Timing**: Started when heavy naval/aerial bombardment ceased, continued until first assault wave troops landed
- **Positioning**: Close to beach (typically 1,000-3,000 yards) for maximum accuracy and psychological effect
- **Firepower**: 504× 4.5-inch rockets in single run, massive suppressive fire, area saturation bombardment
- **Psychological**: Furious barrage to suppress enemy positions during critical assault phase

**Fire Control Coordination:**
- **Radar Ships**: LCI(R)s circled around destroyer or other radar-equipped vessels
- **Fire Control**: Received target direction and distance from radar ships
- **Targeting**: Radar ships relayed coordinates of suspected enemy positions
- **Execution**: LCI(R) would loose barrages on command
- **Coordination**: Worked with LCI(G) gunboats for combined fire missions

**Combat Service:**

**First Combat**: Late 1943, seizure of New Britain Island (New Guinea)

**Major Operations**:
- New Britain (December 1943): First combat employment
- Saipan (June 1944): Fire support for assault waves
- Philippines (1944-1945): Multiple amphibious operations
- Iwo Jima (February 1945): Pre-assault bombardment
- Okinawa (April 1945): Sustained fire support operations

**Notable Vessels**:
- **LCI(R)-707**: Pacific theater operations, documented in multiple amphibious assaults
- **LCI(R)-771**: Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns, redesignated LCI(R) March 1945

**Combat Effectiveness:**

**Advantages**:
- Massive firepower from compact platform (504 rockets)
- Ability to deliver entire load in single pass
- Close-in support unavailable from larger ships
- Precision timing to support assault waves
- Filled gap between naval bombardment and troops ashore

**Tactical Innovation**: LCI(R) became standard element of Pacific amphibious operations post-Tarawa. Doctrine integration proved critical for reducing casualties. Combined with LCI(G) gunboats for sustained suppressive fire.

**Operational Assessment:** Provided critical suppressive fire during vulnerable assault phases. 504-rocket saturation barrage delivered in ~4 seconds created massive area effect. Close-in positioning (within small arms range) made vessels vulnerable but maximized effectiveness. Psychological impact on enemy defenders significant. Demonstrated value of specialized fire support craft integrated with assault doctrine.

**Post-War:** Decommissioned 1946. Transferred to Maritime Commission 1947-1948 for disposal. Rocket systems removed before transfer. Some hulls scrapped, others converted back to cargo configuration.

**Legacy:** Established rocket saturation bombardment as integral amphibious warfare element. Demonstrated massive firepower achievable from small, inexpensive platforms. Filled critical gap between naval bombardment and troops ashore. Post-Tarawa doctrine integration proved essential for subsequent Pacific operations. Influenced Korean War and Vietnam War fire support craft development. Template for modern rocket-armed amphibious support vessels. Lessons applied to riverine warfare and coastal operations.
