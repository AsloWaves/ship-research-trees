**LCAC-Optimized Design** - Whidbey Island-class designed specifically for LCAC hovercraft operations. 8 ships. First LSDs with diesel propulsion and significantly expanded well deck.

**Key Specs:** 11,471/15,939 tons | 609ft | 20+ kn | 4× LCAC capacity | 11,831 sqft vehicle storage | 8 ships

**Innovation:** First LSD class purpose-designed for Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) operations. Diesel propulsion (4× Colt-Pielstick engines, 34,000 SHP) replaced steam turbines for improved efficiency. Expanded well deck to 440×50 feet to accommodate 4 LCACs simultaneously (5 with vehicle ramp raised). Flight deck supports 2× CH-53E helicopters.

**Ships:** USS Whidbey Island (LSD-41), USS Germantown (LSD-42), USS Fort McHenry (LSD-43), USS Gunston Hall (LSD-44), USS Comstock (LSD-45), USS Tortuga (LSD-46), USS Rushmore (LSD-47), USS Ashland (LSD-48). Built by Lockheed Shipbuilding (first 3) and Avondale Industries (last 5).

**Service:** Primary amphibious ships for post-Cold War expeditionary operations. Served in Gulf War, Iraq War, Afghanistan, and humanitarian missions worldwide. Lead ship USS Whidbey Island decommissioned July 2022 after 37 years service. Remaining ships continue active duty with US Navy amphibious forces.

**Design:** Modern sensors including SPS-67 surface search radar and SPS-40 air search radar. Defensive armament of 2× Phalanx CIWS plus 25mm chain guns. Vehicle storage of 11,831 square feet. Troops: 470 Marines (34 officers, 470 enlisted). Can carry tanks, AAVs, LARCs, and full range of USMC vehicles.

**Legacy:** Established template for modern amphibious warfare with LCAC integration. Demonstrated value of diesel propulsion for sustained operations. Cargo variant (Harpers Ferry-class) traded LCAC capacity for increased vehicle storage.
