**Enhanced C3 Transports** - Arthur Middleton-class were larger C3-based transports with enhanced passenger/cargo capacity. 3 ships. All named after American colonial leaders, served major Pacific and European amphibious operations.

**Key Specs:** 10,812/18,000 tons | 489ft | 18.4 kn | 1,500 troops | 2,500 tons cargo | 3 ships

**Design:** Based on C3-P&C (Passenger and Cargo) hull type, larger than earlier Crescent City-class. Originally built as African Comet/American Banker-class merchant ships. Single-screw G.E. geared turbine (8,500 SHP). Enhanced passenger accommodations and cargo capacity. Originally classified AP-55, reclassified APA-25 on February 1, 1943.

**Ships:**
- **USS Arthur Middleton (APA-25)** - Commissioned September 7, 1942
- **USS Samuel Chase (APA-26)** - Commissioned June 13, 1942 (first of class)
- **USS George Clymer (APA-27)** - Commissioned June 15, 1942

**Service:** All three ships served in major WWII amphibious operations. USS Samuel Chase and USS George Clymer participated in Operation Torch (North Africa invasion, November 1942), Operation Husky (Sicily invasion, July 1943), and D-Day Normandy landings (June 6, 1944). Ships carried 1,500 troops with 2,500 tons cargo. Landing craft included LCVPs and LCMs for beach assault.

**Combat Record:** Class participated in Atlantic and Pacific theaters. Named after American Revolution-era statesmen: Arthur Middleton (signer of Declaration of Independence), Samuel Chase (signer of Declaration of Independence, Supreme Court Justice), and George Clymer (signer of Declaration of Independence). Enhanced C3-P&C hull provided better accommodations than standard C3 conversions.

**Legacy:** Bridge between initial Crescent City-class and mass-produced Bayfield-class. Demonstrated value of larger C3-P&C hull for attack transport role. Three-ship class established template for enhanced passenger/cargo capacity. Led directly to Bayfield-class production program (34 ships).
