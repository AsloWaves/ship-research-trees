**First Landing Ship Docks** - Ashland-class were first LSDs with ballast well decks. 8 ships built 1943-1944. Revolutionary concept: carry landing craft in flooded well deck, release at sea. Mother ship for smaller landing craft.

**Key Specs:** 4,790/9,375 tons | 458ft | 15.4/16 kn | 3 LCT or 14 LCM or 41 LCVP | Well deck | First LSD | 8 ships

**Innovation:** Revolutionary well deck design. Ship floods internal well deck via ballast tanks. Landing craft float in/out through stern gate. Can carry and launch landing craft offshore instead of beaching. Mother ship concept - supports smaller craft that couldn't cross oceans.

**Well Deck Concept:**
1. Ship approaches operating area
2. Flood ballast tanks - ship settles in water
3. Open stern gate - well deck now flooded
4. Landing craft (LCT, LCM, LCVP) float out
5. Landing craft conduct assault
6. Reverse process to recover craft

**Capacity (Typical Loads):**
- 3× LCT (Landing Craft, Tank) - 150-ton craft
- OR 14× LCM (Landing Craft, Mechanized)
- OR 41× LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel - Higgins boats)
- OR various mixes

**Design:** Well deck runs 396 feet (most of ship length). Stern gate opens. Ballast system floods/drains well. Above well: superstructure, crew quarters, armament. Can carry troops for small assault or support landing craft operations.

**Ships:**
- **Ashland (LSD-1)** - Commissioned June 1943
- **Belle Grove (LSD-2)**
- **Carter Hall (LSD-3)**
- **Epping Forest (LSD-4)**
- **Gunston Hall (LSD-5)**
- **Lindenwald (LSD-6)**
- **Oak Hill (LSD-7)**
- **White Marsh (LSD-12)** - Numbers 8-11 became different class

**Service:**
- **Tarawa (November 1943):** First combat use of LSD
- **Marshall Islands (1944):** Supported operations
- **Normandy (June 1944):** Transported LCTs across English Channel
- **Pacific Island Campaign:** Saipan, Guam, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa
- **Postwar:** Most decommissioned late 1940s, some served Korea

**Operations:** LSD proved invaluable for transporting landing craft. LCTs too slow to cross oceans - LSD carried them. Could support operations offshore without beaching. Recovered damaged craft. Provided maintenance and supplies.

**Legacy:** Proved well deck concept. Template for all future LSDs, LPDs, LHAs, LHDs. Well deck became standard feature on amphibious ships. Led to Casa Grande-class (28 ships) and all modern amphibious ships.
