**Close-In Fire Support** - LCI(G)-class were gunboat conversions from LCI(L) hulls providing close-in fire support for amphibious operations. Multiple flotillas converted 1943-1945. Combined 40mm guns, 20mm AA, .50 cal MGs, and rockets. Post-Tarawa fire support doctrine.

**Key Specs:** 387 tons | 160ft | 15.5 kn | 2-3× 40mm + 4× 20mm + 10× rockets | 70 crew

**Conversion Purpose:** Painful lessons at Tarawa (November 1943) highlighted need for dedicated close-in fire support during amphibious assaults. Marine Corps adopted LCI gunboat and rocket ship fire support as integral to amphibious doctrine. LCI(G) conversions provided heavy weapons platforms that could operate within small arms range of beaches, delivering suppressive fire unavailable from larger ships positioned offshore.

**Armament Configuration:**

**Early Conversions** (LCI(G)-21, 22, 23, 70):
- 3-inch/50 cal dual purpose guns (number unspecified)
- 40mm Bofors AA guns
- 20mm Oerlikon AA guns
- .50 caliber machine guns

**Standard LCI(G) Configuration**:
- **2-3× 40mm Bofors AA**: Single barrel mounts, replaced three forward 20mm from LCI(L)
- **4× 20mm Oerlikon AA**: Defensive anti-aircraft capability
- **6× .50 cal heavy machine guns**: Close-in defense and suppression
- **10× Mk 7 rocket launchers**: 12× 4.5-inch barrage rockets per launcher, 120 rockets total, full salvo in ~4 seconds, automatic feed, 1,120 yards maximum range

**Example Configuration** (LCI(G)-449): 2× 40mm, 4× 20mm, 6× .50 cal MG, 10× Mk 7 rocket launchers

**Conversion Modifications:**
- **Removed**: Troop landing ramps (side or bow depending on base class), three forward 20mm guns, troop berthing spaces
- **Added**: 40mm gun mounts (typically 2-3 guns), additional 20mm gun positions, rocket launcher mounts, ammunition storage, fire control equipment
- **Structural**: Well deck and troop compartments modified for ammunition stowage

Crew increased from 24 to 70 (5 officers + 65 enlisted) for weapons operations and fire control.

**Tactical Employment:**
- **Mission**: Close-in fire support during amphibious assaults
- **Capabilities**: Direct fire on beach defenses, anti-aircraft protection for landing forces, suppressive fire during troop landing phases, rocket barrage for area saturation
- **Doctrine**: Provided fire support from cessation of naval bombardment until troops ashore. Operated close to beach, within small arms range. Worked with LCI(R) rocket ships for combined fire missions.
- **Timing**: Supported assault waves from H-15 minutes through H+30 minutes and beyond

**Combat Service:**

**First Conversions**: 1943

**Flotilla Organization**: Group Thirteen of Flotilla Five (mid-1944) consisted solely of gunboats: LCI(G)s 21-24, 61, and 64-70

**Major Operations**:
- Saipan (June 15, 1944): LCI(G)-725, LCI(G)-726 provided fire support for landing craft assault waves. LCI(G)-726 suffered 2 KIA and several WIA from enemy fire.
- Philippines campaign
- Iwo Jima (February 1945)
- Okinawa (April 1945)

**Notable Vessels:**
- **LCI(G)-21**: First gunboat conversion with 3-inch/50 cal guns
- **LCI(G)-22**: Early conversion with 3-inch guns
- **LCI(G)-351**: Originally LCI(L)-351, redesignated December 31, 1944, further converted to LCI(M)-351 April 30, 1945
- **LCI(G)-449**: Originally LCI(L)-449, Pacific theater fire support, decommissioned January 1946 at Pacific Reserve Fleet San Diego, transferred to Maritime Commission May 3, 1948
- **LCI(G)-725**: Saipan assault June 15, 1944
- **LCI(G)-726**: Saipan assault, sustained enemy fire casualties

**Operational Assessment:** LCI(G) provided critical fire support capability during vulnerable assault phases. Combined gun and rocket armament delivered sustained suppressive fire. Operated where larger ships couldn't go - within 1,000 yards of hostile beaches. Vulnerability to enemy fire inherent in close-in mission, but tactical value justified casualties. Demonstrated effectiveness of combined arms approach to amphibious operations.

**Post-War:** Most decommissioned 1946. Example: LCI(G)-449 decommissioned January 1946. Transferred to Maritime Commission 1947-1948 for disposal. Some retained slightly longer than base LCI(L) due to specialized equipment removal requirements.

**Legacy:** Established template for specialized fire support craft in amphibious operations. Demonstrated value of converting existing hulls to meet evolving tactical requirements. Post-Tarawa doctrine integration proved critical for reducing casualties in subsequent operations. Combined gun and rocket armament became standard for close-in fire support vessels. Influenced post-war amphibious warfare vessel development. Lessons applied to Korean War and Vietnam War riverine operations.
