**Indirect Fire Support** - LCI(M)-class were mortar support conversions from LCI(L) hulls providing naval surface fire support using chemical mortars. Limited conversions, primarily 1945. Least common LCI variant. 3× M2 4.2-inch chemical mortars for high-angle fire on inland targets.

**Key Specs:** 387 tons | 158.5ft | 14-15 kn | 3× 4.2-inch mortars + 5× 20mm | 50-60 crew

**Specialized Role:** LCI(M) conversions addressed specific tactical need: indirect naval fire support on Japanese positions inland or on reverse slopes. Traditional naval gunfire struggled with high-angle targets behind cover. 4.2-inch chemical mortars provided high-angle fire capability from mobile platform. Enabled extended fire support as fighting moved beyond beaches into island interiors.

**Mortar Armament:**

**Primary Armament**:
- **3× M2 4.2-inch chemical mortars**: Heavy infantry mortars adapted for naval use
- **Mounting**: Three 4ft × 4ft wooden-walled sandboxes on well deck forward
- **Sandbox Construction**: 2 inches × 6 inches walls filled with sand for stability
- **Orientation**: Tripod mortar tubes positioned to fire forward over bow
- **Ammunition Storage**: No. 2 Troop Compartment (under well deck) converted to mortar magazine with extensive stowage

**Defensive Armament**:
- **5× single 20mm Oerlikon AA guns**: One bow mounted, two forward of wheelhouse (port/starboard), two aft of wheelhouse (port/starboard)
- **2× .50 caliber machine guns**: Added to some vessels for additional defense

**Conversion Modifications:**
- **Removed**: Troop landing capability, troop berthing spaces, original use of well deck
- **Added**: Three 4ft × 4ft sandboxes for mortar mounts, M2 4.2-inch chemical mortars with tripod mounts, mortar ammunition magazine (converted troop compartment), fire control equipment
- **Structural**: Well deck fitted with three wooden-walled sandboxes for mortar stability, No. 2 compartment converted from troop space to mortar ammunition magazine, mortars oriented to fire forward over bow

Crew increased from 24 to 50-60 personnel including mortar crews and fire control.

**Tactical Employment:**

**Fire Support Doctrine**:
- **Primary Role**: Indirect naval surface fire support
- **Target Types**: Japanese positions inland or on reverse slopes inaccessible to direct fire
- **Range**: Extended inland fire support as fighting moved beyond beaches
- **High-Angle Fire**: Capability to engage targets behind cover or on reverse slopes

**Fire Control Coordination**:
- **Radar Ships**: LCI(M)s circled around radar-equipped destroyers or other vessels
- **Fire Control Method**: Radar ships relayed direction and distance to targets
- **Communication**: LCI(M) received target coordinates via radio
- **Execution**: Loosed barrages of mortar shells at suspected enemy positions

**Tactical Advantages**:
- High-angle fire for targets behind cover
- Ability to engage reverse slope positions
- Extended fire support as troops advanced inland
- Chemical mortar capability for specialized missions (smoke, illumination, high explosive)

**Service History:**

**Introduction**: 1945 (late war implementation)

**Conversion Example**:
- **LCI(M)-351**: Originally LCI(L)-351 (commissioned May 14, 1943), first redesignation LCI(G)-351 (December 31, 1944), final redesignation LCI(M)-351 (April 30, 1945). Example of vessel converted through multiple configurations, demonstrating hull versatility.

**Operations**:
- **Theater**: Pacific
- **Period**: 1945 (late war)
- **Role**: Fire support for advancing troops during island campaigns
- **Effectiveness**: Provided valuable indirect fire capability from mobile platform

**Combat Assessment:** LCI(M) filled niche role for indirect fire support. Chemical mortars effective against reverse slope targets and inland positions. High-angle fire complemented direct fire from LCI(G) gunboats and rocket barrage from LCI(R). Mobile platform capability maintained fire support as troops advanced. Limited numbers suggest specialized rather than widespread employment.

**Post-War:** Decommissioned 1946. Transferred to Maritime Commission for disposal 1947-1948. Mortar systems removed before transfer. Most scrapped late 1940s due to limited post-war utility and specialized equipment.

**Operational Comparison:**

**LCI(M) vs Other Variants**:
- **vs LCI(G)**: Indirect vs direct fire, high-angle vs flat trajectory, inland vs beach targets
- **vs LCI(R)**: Sustained fire vs saturation barrage, precision vs area effect, extended vs initial bombardment
- **Tactical Timeline**: LCI(R) pre-assault saturation → LCI(G) assault phase support → LCI(M) post-landing inland support

**Coordination**: LCI(M) operated as part of integrated fire support doctrine. Initial beach assault: LCI(R) saturation + LCI(G) close support. Post-landing phase: LCI(M) indirect fire + LCI(G) direct fire + naval gunfire. Progressive fire support as troops advanced inland.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated value of indirect fire support from mobile naval platform. Chemical mortar capability unique among LCI variants. High-angle fire filled gap in amphibious fire support doctrine. Influenced post-war development of fire support craft. Limited production numbers reflect specialized niche role rather than widespread tactical requirement. Lessons applied to Korean War and Vietnam War riverine operations where mortar boats provided similar inland fire support.

**Historical Significance:** Represents final evolution of LCI concept - from troop transport (LCI(L)) to gunboat (LCI(G)) to rocket ship (LCI(R)) to mortar support (LCI(M)). Demonstrates adaptability of single hull design to diverse mission requirements. Complete conversion progression validates LCI as versatile amphibious warfare platform.
