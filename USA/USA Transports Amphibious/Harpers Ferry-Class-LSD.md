**Cargo Variant** - Harpers Ferry-class are cargo-optimized variants of Whidbey Island design. 4 ships. Shortened well deck (2 LCAC vs 4) with increased vehicle/cargo stowage.

**Key Specs:** 16,601 tons full | 609ft | 20+ kn | 2× LCAC capacity | Enhanced cargo storage | 4 ships

**Design Philosophy:** Cargo variant of Whidbey Island-class demonstrating flexibility of LSD platform. Shortened well deck accommodates 2 LCACs instead of 4, but space gained used for enhanced vehicle and cargo stowage. Same diesel propulsion (4× Colt-Pielstick engines, 34,000 SHP) and dimensions as Whidbey Island (609×84×20 ft).

**Ships:**
- **USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49)** - Commissioned January 7, 1995
- **USS Carter Hall (LSD-50)** - Commissioned 1995
- **USS Oak Hill (LSD-51)** - Commissioned 1996
- **USS Pearl Harbor (LSD-52)** - Laid down January 1995, launched February 1996, commissioned May 1998

**Service:** Active duty with US Navy amphibious forces. Provides enhanced logistics capability compared to pure LCAC carriers. Troop capacity of 405 + 101. Flight deck supports CH-53E helicopters for vertical assault. Same defensive armament as Whidbey Island (2× Phalanx CIWS, 2× 25mm Mk 38).

**Operational Concept:** Balances LCAC capability with cargo logistics. Two LCACs provide substantial over-the-horizon assault capability while enhanced cargo spaces support sustained operations. Diesel propulsion provides extended range and reduced maintenance compared to steam turbines.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated value of mission-tailored LSD variants. Cargo-optimized design fills niche between pure LCAC carriers (Whidbey Island) and traditional cargo ships. Four-ship class provides flexibility for amphibious ready groups requiring different logistics profiles.
