**Cold War Modernization** - Thomaston-class represented major step forward in LSD design with 40% greater displacement and speed than WWII predecessors. 8 ships. Served through Vietnam War era.

**Key Specs:** 8,899/11,525 tons | 510ft | 21-24 kn | Well deck 391×48 ft | 3× LCU capacity | 8 ships

**Innovation:** Significantly larger and faster than WWII Casa Grande-class. Well deck measuring 391×48 feet (119.2×14.6 m) could accommodate 3 LCUs, 9 LCM-8s, or 50 LVTs. Two 50-ton cranes with reach into well deck for cargo handling. Geared steam turbines provided 21-knot sustained speed with 24-knot maximum.

**Ships:** USS Thomaston (LSD-28), USS Plymouth Rock (LSD-29), USS Fort Snelling (LSD-30), USS Point Defiance (LSD-31), USS Spiegel Grove (LSD-32), USS Alamo (LSD-33), USS Hermitage (LSD-34), USS Monticello (LSD-35). All commissioned 1954-1957 at Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Mississippi.

**Service:** Cold War amphibious operations including Vietnam War. Provided well deck launch capability for landing craft and amphibious vehicles. Troop capacity of 300 Marines. Vehicle storage area of 975 square meters. Eight 3-inch/50 cal dual purpose guns for air and surface defense.

**Design:** Two-shaft steam turbine propulsion. Enhanced cargo handling with dual 50-ton cranes. Well deck depth allowed full range of landing craft operations. Crew of 304 plus 300 embarked troops. Served 30-43 years before decommissioning 1984-1997.

**Legacy:** Established modern LSD capabilities for Cold War era. Set standards for well deck dimensions and cargo handling that influenced subsequent Anchorage and Whidbey Island classes. Demonstrated value of larger, faster amphibious ships for global operations.
