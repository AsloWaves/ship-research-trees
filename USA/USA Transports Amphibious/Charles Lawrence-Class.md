**High Speed Transports** - Charles Lawrence-class APDs were destroyer escorts converted to high speed transports. 83 ships converted 1943-1945. Fast (24 knots) for commando raids, reconnaissance, and special operations.

**Key Specs:** 1,400/1,653 tons | 306ft | 23/24 kn | 162 troops | 4 LCVP | Fast for raids | 83 ships

**Innovation:** Converted Buckley and Cannon-class destroyer escorts (DE) to APDs. Retained speed and armament. Modified to carry 162 troops and 4 LCVP landing craft. Fast transports for raiding parties, Marines, UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams), reconnaissance teams.

**Conversion:** Destroyer escort hulls modified:
- Reduce some armament to save weight
- Add troop berthing for 162 men
- Install 4 LCVP davits
- Retain ASW weapons (depth charges)
- Keep speed (24 knots)

**Design:** Destroyer escort hull and machinery. Forward superstructure. Four LCVP on davits. Troop accommodations. Armament: 5-inch gun, 40mm and 20mm AA, depth charges. Fast enough to avoid enemy forces, deliver troops, and escape.

**Mission Profile:**
- **Commando Raids:** Fast insertion/extraction
- **Reconnaissance:** Small teams to scout landing beaches
- **UDT Operations:** Underwater Demolition Teams (precursor to Navy SEALs)
- **Guerrilla Support:** Support resistance forces
- **Small Unit Transport:** Company-sized units (160 troops)

**Sub-Classes (DE Conversions):**
- **Charles Lawrence** (APD-37) - Buckley-class DE conversions
- Various other sub-types based on different DE classes
- Total: 83 APDs converted from DEs

**Service:**
- **Pacific Theater:** Primary employment
- **Island Raids:** Hit-and-run operations
- **UDT Operations:** Beach reconnaissance before landings
- **Philippines Liberation:** Special operations
- **Okinawa:** UDT beach clearing operations
- **Korea (1950-1953):** Reactivated for Korean War operations

**Comparison with Earlier APDs:**
- **Wickes/Clemson APDs:** Converted WWI destroyers, older, less capable
- **Charles Lawrence (DE-based):** Newer, more reliable, better armament, diesel engines

**Troops Carried:** 162 embarked troops - typically:
- Marine raiders
- UDT teams
- Army rangers
- Reconnaissance units
- Guerrilla support teams

**Postwar:** Many decommissioned 1946. Some reactivated Korean War. Several transferred to allied navies. Most scrapped 1960s.

**Legacy:** Proved high-speed transport concept for special operations. Precursor to modern amphibious warfare ships. UDT operations pioneered tactics used by Navy SEALs.
