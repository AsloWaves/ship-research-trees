**First Post-War LST** - Terrebonne Parish-class were first purpose-designed post-WWII LSTs with 4 diesel engines and improved hull. 15 ships. Bridge between WWII and modern LST concepts.

**Key Specs:** 2,590/5,800 tons | 384ft | 14 kn | 380 troops | 4 diesel engines | 15 ships

**Design:** First post-WWII LST design based on experimental units LST-1153/1154. SCB 9A project. Four diesel engines provided increased power and redundancy compared to WWII two-engine designs. Reversible pitch propellers improved maneuverability for beaching/unbeaching operations. Finer hull lines improved seakeeping over blunt WWII LST bow. Larger dimensions (384×55×17 ft) increased capacity.

**Ships:** USS Terrebonne Parish (LST-1156), USS Terrell County (LST-1157), USS Tioga County (LST-1158), USS Tom Green County (LST-1159), USS Traverse County (LST-1160), USS Vernon County (LST-1161), USS Wahkiakum County (LST-1162), USS Waldo County (LST-1163), USS Walworth County (LST-1164), USS Washoe County (LST-1165), USS Washtenaw County (LST-1166), USS Westchester County (LST-1167), USS Wexford County (LST-1168), USS Whitfield County (LST-1169), USS Windham County (LST-1170).

**Construction:** Built in three batches of 5 ships each. Bath Iron Works: LST-1156 through LST-1160. Ingalls Shipbuilding: LST-1161 through LST-1165. Christy Shipbuilding: LST-1166 through LST-1170. Laid down 1952, commissioned 1952-1954.

**Service:** Cold War amphibious operations 1952-1970s (US Navy). Vietnam War support. Training exercises. Foreign military assistance. Proved diesel propulsion superiority over steam for LST operations. Capacity increased to 380 troops vs. 140 on WWII LSTs. Full load displacement 5,800 tons vs. 4,080 tons on LST-542 class.

**Foreign Transfers:** Venezuela (USS Vernon County as ARBV Amazonas T-21, 1973-1977). Peru (3 ships including USS Waldo County as BAP Pisco, USS Walworth County as BAP Paita, USS Washoe County as BAP Callao, leased 1984, sold 1999). Turkey (USS Westchester County as TCG Serdar L-402, 1974). Spain (USS Wexford County as Martín Álvarez L-12, loaned 1971, discharged 1995). Greece (USS Whitfield County, sold 1977).

**Legacy:** First post-WWII LST design established diesel propulsion standard. Influenced De Soto County and Newport classes. Modified experimental design from late WWII (LST-1153/1154). Bridge between WWII beaching LSTs and modern amphibious ships. Demonstrated improved hull design and propulsion systems.
