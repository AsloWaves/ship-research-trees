**Largest AKA Class** - Andromeda/Achernar-class were largest attack cargo ship class built during WWII. 35 ships. Type C2 merchantman conversions, redesignated LKA in 1969.

**Key Specs:** 6,556-7,132/13,905-14,200 tons | 459ft | 16.5 kn | 4,450 DWT cargo | 35 ships

**Design:** Type C2-S-B1 and C2-S-AJ3 Maritime Commission conversions. Single-screw geared turbine (6,000 HP). Two sub-classes: Andromeda (AKA-15 to AKA-20, commissioned 1943-1944) and Achernar (AKA-53 to AKA-111, commissioned 1944-1945). Cargo capacity: 393,160 cuft non-refrigerated plus 16,131 cuft refrigerated. 30-ton boom for heavy equipment.

**Ships (select):** USS Andromeda (AKA-15), USS Aquarius (AKA-16), USS Centaurus (AKA-17), USS Cepheus (AKA-18), USS Achernar (AKA-53), USS Algol (AKA-54), USS Alshain (AKA-55), USS Arneb (AKA-56), USS Capricornus (AKA-57), USS Chara (AKA-58), USS Diphda (AKA-59), and 24 others. Most named after stars and constellations.

**Service:** Pacific theater WWII and Korean War operations. USS Andromeda (AKA-15) earned 5 battle stars WWII and 5 battle stars Korean War, serving 1943-1956. Redesignated from AKA to LKA on January 1, 1969. Many served into 1970s. Carried 8 LCM-3s, 10-16 LCVPs, and 1 LCP(L) for ship-to-shore cargo transfer.

**Construction:** Built by Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. (Kearny, NJ) and Moore Dry Dock Co. (Oakland, CA). Converted from commercial C2 hulls during or immediately after construction. Armament varied by year: early ships had 4× 3-inch/50, later modified to 2× 40mm twin mounts.

**Legacy:** Largest class of attack cargo ships built during WWII. Type C2 conversions proved cost-effective solution for amphibious cargo transport. Template established for attack cargo ship operations. Long service lives demonstrated value of design through Korean War and beyond.
