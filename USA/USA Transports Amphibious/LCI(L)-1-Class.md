**Ocean-Going Infantry Transport** - LCI(L)-1-class were first large landing craft infantry vessels with 200-troop capacity and 4,000 nm range. 350 ships. Square conning tower, side ramps. Served both Pacific and European theaters 1943-1945.

**Key Specs:** 216/389 tons | 158.5ft | 16 kn | 200 troops | 4,000 nm range | 350 ships

**Design:** British request for seagoing vessel larger than LCVP (36 troops) but smaller than LST (163 troops) led to LCI development. 158.5×23.25×5.4 ft dimensions optimized for 200 infantry troops. Quarter-inch steel plate hull construction. Shallow draft (3.08 ft light, 5.4 ft loaded forward) enabled beach landing. Square, low-profile conning tower provided limited visibility but reduced silhouette. Narrow bow design (narrower than main deck) to accommodate side ramp system.

**Propulsion:** Eight Detroit Diesel 6-71 'Quad' engines (two banks of four, one per shaft). Total power: 1,600 BHP. Twin variable pitch propellers. Speed: 16 knots maximum, 14 knots continuous, 12 knots cruising. Range: 4,000 nm at 12 knots loaded, 500 nm at 15 knots. Fuel capacity: 120 tons diesel, 200 gallons lube oil. Diesel engines provided reliability for extended ocean transits from rear bases to invasion beaches.

**Landing System:** Side gangway/ramp system with port and starboard deployment. Two gangways on either side of bow led to pair of lowered ramps. **Critical Design Flaw**: Deck wider than prow meant ramps exposed disembarking troops to enemy fire from both sides. Side ramp vulnerability became apparent in combat, particularly Tarawa (November 1943) and early Pacific operations. Limitation addressed in successor LCI(L)-351 class with enclosed bow ramp design.

**Troop Accommodation:** 200 infantry troops (6 officers + 194 enlisted). Designed for 48-hour passage from rear bases to invasion beaches. Crew: 24 (2 officers + 21 enlisted, some sources indicate up to 60 for specialized variants). Minimal troop comfort - focus on transport capacity over habitability. Quarter-inch hull plating provided no armor protection.

**Combat Service:** Extensive WWII service in both theaters starting 1943. European operations: Anzio (January 1944), Normandy D-Day (June 6, 1944), Southern France (August 1944), Elba, Mediterranean landings. Pacific operations: Tarawa (November 1943), Saipan (June 1944), Guam (July 1944), Philippines (1944-1945), Iwo Jima (February 1945), Okinawa (April 1945). Side ramp design made vessels vulnerable during initial assault waves. Post-Tarawa lessons learned led to increased fire support requirements and development of LCI(G) and LCI(R) variants.

**Notable Vessels:** USS LCI(L)-10 (early production, transferred to State Department June 1947). USS LCI(L)-94 (Coast Guard manned, D-Day Normandy operations). USS LCI(L)-24 (later converted to LCI(G)-24, sold for scrap December 13, 1946).

**Post-War:** Most decommissioned 1946, struck from Naval Register same year. Transferred to Maritime Commission 1947-1948 for scrapping. Examples: LCI(L)-47 decommissioned April 24, 1946, transferred January 22, 1948. LCI(L)-759 decommissioned May 13, 1946, transferred February 17, 1948. Some converted to LCI(G), LCI(R), or LCI(M) variants before decommissioning.

**Limitations:** Side ramp design exposed troops to enemy fire from both flanks. Square conning tower provided limited bridge visibility. Shallow draft limited rough sea capability. Top-heavy when fully loaded. Quarter-inch hull plating offered no armor protection against direct fire. Vulnerable to beach obstacles and mines during approach.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated need for ocean-going infantry landing craft between tactical LCVP and strategic LST. Filled critical 200-troop capacity gap. Proved diesel propulsion superiority for amphibious operations. Side ramp vulnerability led directly to improved LCI(L)-351 enclosed bow ramp design. Established template for specialized fire support conversions (LCI(G), LCI(R), LCI(M)). Participated in every major Allied amphibious operation 1943-1945.
