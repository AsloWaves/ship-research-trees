**Improved Infantry Transport** - LCI(L)-351-class were improved large landing craft with round conning tower and enclosed bow ramp. 748 ships. Major survivability improvements over LCI-1 class. Served both Pacific and European theaters 1943-1945.

**Key Specs:** 216/389 tons | 158.5ft | 15.5 kn | 200 troops | 4,000 nm range | 748 ships

**Design Improvements:** LCI(L)-350 introduced two critical enhancements carried forward on all subsequent hulls. **Round, Taller Conning Tower**: Replaced square low-profile design with round taller structure, affording significantly better visibility from bridge. Improved ship handling and tactical awareness during beach approaches. **Enclosed Bow Ramp System**: Revolutionary change from vulnerable side ramps. Single enclosed bow ramp with two bow doors provided protection and concealment for disembarking troops. Doors swing open, ramp extends forward for beach access. Reduced exposure to enemy observation and fire - significant tactical advantage over LCI-1 side ramps.

**Specifications:** 158.5×23.25 ft dimensions identical to LCI-1 class. Displacement: 216 tons light, 389 tons full load (slightly different from LCI-1 due to bow door configuration). Draft: 2.83 ft forward landing, 5.25 ft aft landing, 5.4 ft loaded. Quarter-inch steel plate construction throughout. Fuel capacity: 110 tons (approximately 10 tons less than predecessors).

**Propulsion:** Eight Detroit Diesel 6-71 'Quad' engines in two banks (4 per shaft). Total power: 1,600 BHP. Twin shafts with variable pitch propellers. Speed: 15.5 knots maximum, 14-15 knots continuous. Range: 4,000 nm at 12 knots, 500 nm at 15 knots. Fuel: 110 tons diesel, 200 gallons lube oil. Reliable ocean transit capability from rear bases to invasion beaches.

**Troop Capacity:** 200 infantry troops standard (6 officers + 194 enlisted). Designed for 48-hour passage. Crew: 24 (2 officers + 21-22 enlisted). Same troop accommodation as LCI-1 class but with improved survivability during beach operations. Enclosed bow ramp protected troops during final approach and disembarkation.

**Combat Service:** Same major amphibious operations as LCI-1 class, with improved survivability. European theater: Anzio, Normandy, Southern France, Mediterranean. Pacific theater: Tarawa through Okinawa. Enclosed bow ramp design proved superior to side ramps - reduced casualties during beach assault. Many vessels served through entire Pacific campaign 1943-1945.

**Notable Vessels:**
- **USS LCI(L)-351**: First of improved class, laid down March 5, 1943, launched April 8, 1943, commissioned May 14, 1943. Redesignated LCI(G)-351 December 31, 1944, then LCI(M)-351 April 30, 1945 - example of multiple conversion capability.
- **USS LCI(L)-449**: Laid down June 17, 1943, launched August 14, 1943, commissioned August 25, 1943. Later converted to LCI(G)-449, decommissioned January 1946 at Pacific Reserve Fleet San Diego.
- **USS LCI(L)-1091**: Late production vessel commissioned September 21, 1944.

**Conversions:** Many LCI(L)-351 class hulls converted to specialized fire support variants:
- **LCI(G)**: Gunboat conversions with 40mm guns, 20mm AA, rockets
- **LCI(R)**: Rocket ship conversions with 504 rockets
- **LCI(M)**: Mortar support conversions with 3× 4.2-inch mortars

Conversion timing varied: LCI(G) conversions from 1943 onwards, LCI(R) late 1943 onwards (some during construction), LCI(M) primarily 1945. Conversions demonstrated hull versatility and addressed post-Tarawa fire support lessons.

**Post-War:** Decommissioned 1946, transferred to Maritime Commission 1947-1948. Some converted variants served slightly longer. Most scrapped late 1940s. Extended service compared to LCI-1 class due to superior design features and later construction dates.

**Tactical Assessment:** Enclosed bow ramp provided significant tactical advantage - protected troops from flanking fire during disembarkation. Round conning tower improved bridge visibility for navigation and fire control. Both improvements addressed LCI-1 class limitations. Demonstrated value of combat experience driving design iteration. Became preferred LCI configuration for remainder of war.

**Legacy:** Represented mature LCI design incorporating combat lessons. 748 ships made this largest LCI class by hull count. Enclosed bow ramp became standard for future landing craft designs. Round conning tower improved all-weather operations. Hull design proved adaptable to multiple mission conversions (gunboat, rocket, mortar). Influenced post-war amphibious craft development. Established template for protected troop landing under fire.
