# Henderson-Class Transport (AP-1) - 1918

## Overview
Henderson-Class was the United States Navy's first purpose-built transport ship, representing a milestone in naval auxiliary vessel design. USS Henderson (AP-1) commissioned 5 April 1918, served through WWI trooping operations, interwar fleet exercises, and WWII Pacific operations. Displacement 7,650 tons, length 423 feet, carried 1,500 troops. Pioneered dedicated troop transport design with specialized berthing, mess facilities, and boat davits for amphibious landings. Served 28 years (1918-1946), participated in WWI trooping, Nicaraguan intervention, WWII Pacific landings. Decommissioned 1946, sold for scrap 1946. Established template for all future US transport ships.
