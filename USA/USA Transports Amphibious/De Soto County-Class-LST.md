**Advanced Post-War LST** - De Soto County-class were advanced Cold War LSTs with air conditioning, 6 diesel engines, and 17.5-knot speed. 7 ships (8 planned, 1 cancelled). Last conventional beaching LST design.

**Key Specs:** 3,560/7,823 tons | 445ft | 17.5 kn | 575 troops | 100,000 gal liquid cargo | 7 ships

**Design:** SCB 119 project. Largest pre-Newport LST class with significant size increase over Terrebonne Parish (445×62×16.7 ft vs. 384×55×17 ft). Six Nordberg diesel engines with controllable pitch propellers provided 17.5-knot speed (vs. 14 knots on Terrebonne Parish). More sophisticated construction with better structural integrity and modern welding techniques. Air conditioning throughout ship as standard feature.

**Ships:** USS De Soto County (LST-1171), USS Suffolk County (LST-1173), USS Grant County (LST-1174), USS York County (LST-1175), USS Graham County (LST-1176), USS Lorain County (LST-1177), USS Wood County (LST-1178). LST-1172 cancelled 1955 (contract not awarded).

**Armament:** Three twin 3-inch/50 cal gun mounts with modern 1950s fire control systems. Improved AA capability over previous classes. 4 LCVP landing craft with modern davit arrangements for improved launch/recovery.

**Capacity:** 575 troops (vs. 380 on Terrebonne Parish). 28 medium tanks or vehicles up to 75 tons. Tank deck length accommodates 288-inch capacity vehicles. 100,000 gallons liquid cargo capacity. Improved crew comfort with air conditioning, improved habitability spaces, and modern amenities.

**Service:** US Navy 1957-1972 (most ships). Vietnam War operations, Cold War amphibious exercises, Mediterranean deployments, Western Pacific operations. USS Suffolk County had longest US service (transferred to MARAD 1992). USS Graham County converted to patrol craft tender 1972 for different mission. USS Lorain County transferred to MARAD 1994 (one of last in US service).

**Foreign Transfers:** Italy (2 ships: USS De Soto County as Grado 1972, USS York County as Caorle 1972). Brazil (USS Grant County as Duque de Caxias 1973). Extended service in foreign navies. USS Wood County stricken 1989.

**Legacy:** Last conventional beaching LST before revolutionary Newport class. Bridge between Terrebonne Parish and Newport designs. Incorporated lessons from Korean War. Demonstrated value of air conditioning for crew habitability. Speed enhancement (17.5 knots) improved strategic mobility while retaining traditional beaching capability.
