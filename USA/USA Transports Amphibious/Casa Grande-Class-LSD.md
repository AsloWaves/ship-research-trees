**First Purpose-Built LSDs** - Casa Grande-class introduced innovative floodable well deck design for amphibious operations. 15 ships. Revolutionized amphibious warfare doctrine.

**Key Specs:** 4,032/7,930 tons | 458ft | 15 kn | Well deck for 2-3 LCT | 15 ships

**Innovation:** First dock landing ships purpose-built with floodable well deck rather than converted from other hulls. Could ballast down stern to flood well deck, allowing LCTs and other landing craft to float out for beach assault. Protected internal deck eliminated need for davits and allowed vehicles to be pre-loaded onto landing craft.

**Ships:** USS Casa Grande (LSD-13), USS Rushmore (LSD-14), USS Shadwell (LSD-15), USS Cabildo (LSD-16), USS Catamount (LSD-17), USS Colonial (LSD-18), USS Comstock (LSD-19), USS Donner (LSD-20), and 7 others.

**Service:** Commissioned 1944-1946, served through WWII Pacific campaigns. Participated in Lingayen Gulf (January 1945), Okinawa (April 1945), and Philippines operations. Well deck could accommodate 2 British LCTs or 3 US LCTs, plus amphibious vehicles like DUKW and LVT. Decommissioned 1969-1974.

**Design:** Reciprocating steam engines provided 15-knot speed. Moderate armament for self-defense (1× 5"/38, 12× 40mm, 16× 20mm). Crew of 254 plus 218 troops and 36 landing craft detachment personnel. Two-shaft design with Babcock & Wilcox oil-fired boilers.

**Legacy:** Established floodable well deck as standard for amphibious warfare. Template influenced all subsequent LSD designs through modern Whidbey Island-class. Proved invaluable for Pacific island-hopping campaign.
