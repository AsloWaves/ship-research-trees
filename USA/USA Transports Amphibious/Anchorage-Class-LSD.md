**First LCAC-Capable LSDs** - Anchorage-class were first dock landing ships designed to accommodate LCAC hovercraft. 5 ships. Enhanced cargo capacity and modern defensive systems.

**Key Specs:** 8,325/14,095 tons | 553ft | 20 kn | Well deck 430×40 ft | 2× LCAC or 3× LCU | 5 ships

**Innovation:** First LSD class designed for Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) operations with appropriate well deck dimensions. Enhanced cargo capacity: 12,000 sqft vehicle parking, 8,400 sqft storage, 1,400 cuft ammunition. Modernized armament included Phalanx CIWS for point defense against anti-ship missiles. Steam turbine propulsion (24,000 SHP) provided 20-knot speed.

**Ships:**
- **USS Anchorage (LSD-36)** - Commissioned March 15, 1969, decommissioned 2003. Earned 6 battle stars during Vietnam War.
- **USS Portland (LSD-37)** - Commissioned October 3, 1970
- **USS Pensacola (LSD-38)** - Commissioned March 27, 1971
- **USS Mount Vernon (LSD-39)** - Commissioned May 13, 1972. Participated in Operation Frequent Wind (Saigon evacuation, April 1975).
- **USS Fort Fisher (LSD-40)** - Commissioned December 9, 1972

**Service:** Vietnam War through Gulf War. USS Anchorage and USS Mount Vernon participated in Operation Frequent Wind, evacuating personnel from Saigon in April 1975. Helicopter deck supported vertical assault operations. Crew of 375 plus troop capacity. Well deck could handle 3 LCUs, 9 LCM-8s, or 2 LCACs.

**Design:** Originally armed with 8× 3-inch/50 cal guns (4 twin mounts), later upgraded with Mk-38 machine guns and 2× Phalanx CIWS. Two-shaft steam turbine design. Well deck 430×40 feet optimized for transitioning to LCAC operations. Laid groundwork for fully LCAC-optimized Whidbey Island-class.

**Legacy:** Bridged gap between traditional LCU/LCM operations and modern LCAC capability. Vietnam War service demonstrated value of helicopter-capable amphibious ships. Set stage for Whidbey Island-class with expanded 440-foot well deck.
