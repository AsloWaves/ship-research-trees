**C3 Conversions for Army** - Admiral W.S. Benson-class were C3 cargo ship conversions for Army transport service. 8 ships. Large troop capacity (4,500), transferred to Army 1946 and renamed for generals.

**Key Specs:** 9,676/20,120 tons | 609ft | 19 kn | 4,500 troops | 8,000 tons cargo | 8 ships

**Design:** Converted from Maritime Commission C3 cargo ships (MC P2-SE2-R1 design). G.E. turbo-electric drive (18,000 SHP twin-screw) provided 19-knot speed. Divided machinery spaces enhanced survivability. Bethlehem Steel, Alameda, California construction. Larger and faster than most WWII-era transports.

**Ships:**
- **USS Admiral W.S. Benson (AP-120)** - Commissioned 1944, lead ship
- **USS Admiral W.L. Capps (AP-121)** - Commissioned 1944
- **USS Admiral R.E. Coontz (AP-122)** - Commissioned 1944
- **USS Admiral E.W. Eberle (AP-123)** - Commissioned 1944
- **USS Admiral C.F. Hughes (AP-124)** - Commissioned 1944
- **USS Admiral H.T. Mayo (AP-125)** - Commissioned 1944
- **USS Admiral Hugh Rodman (AP-126)** - Commissioned 1944
- **USS Admiral W.S. Sims (AP-127)** - Commissioned 1945

**Service:** WWII transport operations 1944-1946. Carried 4,500 troops with 8,000 tons cargo capacity. All named for US Navy admirals during Navy service. Transferred to Army 1946 and renamed for Army generals. Assigned to Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) 1950 with civilian crews for Korean War operations.

**Post-War Career:** Unique class transitioning from Navy to Army control. Originally commissioned as Navy transports (AP) but transferred to Army Transportation Corps 1946. Ships renamed: Admiral W.S. Benson became USAT General M.C. Meigs, Admiral W.L. Capps became USAT General Simon B. Buckner, and so forth. Operated by civilian merchant crews under MSTS charter during Korean War.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated value of large-capacity C3 conversions for troop transport. Turbo-electric drive provided reliability and fuel efficiency. Divided machinery spaces improved survivability. Bridge between Navy attack transports and post-war Military Sea Transportation Service operations.
