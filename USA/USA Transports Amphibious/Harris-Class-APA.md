**WWI Conversions** - Harris-class were WWI-era transports converted to early attack transports. 8 ships. Oldest ships used as APAs in WWII, saw action in all major theaters.

**Key Specs:** 13,529/21,900 tons | 535ft | 17.2 kn | 1,650 troops | 8 ships

**Design:** Originally built 1919-1922 as Shipping Board "535 class" (535 feet length). Largest APAs of WWII at 535 feet. Converted to attack transports 1941-1943. Two Curtis geared turbines (12,000 SHP total) with 8 Yarrow boilers. Carried 33 LCVPs and 2-4 LCM(3)s for beach assault operations. No main guns, defensive armament only.

**Ships:**
- **USS Harris (APA-2)**
- **USS Zeilin (APA-3)**
- **USS Leonard Wood (APA-12)**
- **USS Joseph T. Dickman (APA-13)**
- **USS Hunter Liggett (APA-14)**
- **USS Henry T. Allen (APA-15)**
- **USS J. Franklin Bell (APA-16)**
- **USS American Legion (APA-17)**

**Service:** Saw action in Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Pacific theaters during WWII. Despite age (20+ years at war's start), performed reliably in amphibious operations. Larger size (21,900 tons full load) provided spacious troop accommodations. Troop capacity of 1,650 comparable to purpose-built APAs. All decommissioned 1946.

**Construction History:** Built WWI era as troop transports under US Shipping Board emergency program. Served limited duty 1919-1941. Reactivated and converted to attack transports (APA) 1941-1943. Added landing craft davits, defensive armament, and improved communications.

**Legacy:** Proved WWI-era hulls could be successfully adapted for WWII amphibious warfare. Filled critical gap before purpose-built Bayfield and Haskell classes entered service in large numbers. Demonstrated value of large troop capacity for major amphibious operations.
