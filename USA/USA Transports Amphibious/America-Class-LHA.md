**Aviation-Focused Assault Ships** - America-class are newest amphibious assault ships. Aviation-focused with enhanced F-35B operations. LHA-6/7 have no well deck (aviation only). LHA-8+ restore well deck.

**Key Specs:** 45,000/45,693 tons | 844ft | 22+ kn | 12-20 F-35B + helos | 1,871 Marines | 11 planned

**Innovation:** LHA-6/7 eliminate well deck for increased aviation fuel and ordnance. Can operate 12-20 F-35B Lightning II - "Lightning Carrier" concept. LHA-8+ restore well deck based on Marine Corps requirements. Hybrid electric propulsion LHA-8+.

**Design Variants:**
- **LHA-6/7 (America, Tripoli):** No well deck, maximum aviation focus, 25,000 sq ft additional aviation support space
- **LHA-8+ (Bougainville onwards):** Well deck restored (smaller than Wasp), balanced aviation/amphibious

**Ships:**
- **America (LHA-6)** - Commissioned 2014, no well deck
- **Tripoli (LHA-7)** - Commissioned 2020, no well deck
- **Bougainville (LHA-8)** - Building, delivery 2024, with well deck
- **Fallujah (LHA-9)** - Building, with well deck
- **LHA-10, LHA-11** - Planned

**F-35B "Lightning Carrier" Concept:**
- LHA-6/7 can embark 12-20 F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters
- Additional aviation fuel and ordnance storage
- Enhanced flight deck and maintenance facilities
- Provides sea-based fifth-generation strike capability
- Comparable to small aircraft carrier

**Capabilities (LHA-6/7 - No Well Deck):**
- **Aviation:** 25-30 helicopters OR 12-20 F-35B + helicopters
- **Landing Craft:** None (no well deck)
- **Marines:** 1,871 embarked troops
- **Focus:** Maximum aviation operations

**Capabilities (LHA-8+ - With Well Deck):**
- **Aviation:** 20-25 helicopters or F-35B mix
- **Landing Craft:** 2 LCAC or landing craft
- **Marines:** 1,871 embarked troops
- **Focus:** Balanced aviation/amphibious

**Service:** America and Tripoli operational. Focused on F-35B operations and expeditionary strike. Pacific fleet operations. LHA-8+ will provide balanced capabilities.

**Controversy:** Elimination of well deck on LHA-6/7 controversial - Marine Corps wanted amphibious capability restored, leading to well deck return on LHA-8+.
