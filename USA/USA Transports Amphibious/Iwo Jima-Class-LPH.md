**First Helicopter Assault Ships** - Iwo Jima-class were first purpose-built amphibious assault ships designed for helicopter operations. 7 ships. Pioneered vertical envelopment - landing Marines by helicopter instead of beach assault.

**Key Specs:** 17,000/18,300 tons | 602ft | 23 kn | 20-25 helicopters | 2,000 Marines | First purpose-built LPH | 7 ships

**Innovation:** First ships built from keel-up as helicopter assault carriers. Full-length flight deck with multiple helicopter spots. Large hangar deck. No well deck - pure aviation ship. Revolutionized amphibious warfare with vertical envelopment concept.

**Design:** Resembles small aircraft carrier. Full-length flight deck 602 feet. Large island superstructure on starboard. Hangar deck below flight deck. No well deck or landing craft. Can embark 2,000 Marines. Medical facilities. Single shaft propulsion.

**Ships:**
- **Iwo Jima (LPH-2)** - Commissioned 1961, decommissioned 1993
- **Okinawa (LPH-3)** - Commissioned 1962, decommissioned 1992
- **Guadalcanal (LPH-7)** - Commissioned 1963, decommissioned 1994
- **Guam (LPH-9)** - Commissioned 1965, decommissioned 1998
- **Tripoli (LPH-10)** - Commissioned 1966, decommissioned 1995
- **New Orleans (LPH-11)** - Commissioned 1968, decommissioned 1997
- **Inchon (LPH-12)** - Commissioned 1970, decommissioned 2002 (last)

**Air Group (Typical):**
- 12× CH-46 Sea Knight medium helicopters
- 4× CH-53 Sea Stallion heavy-lift helicopters
- 4× UH-1 Huey utility helicopters
- 4× AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters

**Vertical Envelopment Concept:**
Marines assault from helicopters instead of landing craft. Bypass beach defenses. Land directly at objectives inland. Faster deployment. Revolutionized amphibious doctrine.

**Service:**
- **Vietnam War (1965-1975):** Extensive operations, Marine Corps operations
- **Mayaguez Incident (1975):** Okinawa supported rescue
- **Beirut (1982-1984):** Iwo Jima, Guam
- **Persian Gulf (1991):** Multiple ships, Desert Storm
- **Somalia (1992-1993):** Tripoli flagship
- **Haiti (1994):** Operations

**Legacy:** Proved helicopter assault concept. Template for all future amphibious assault ships. Led to larger Tarawa and Wasp classes with added landing craft capability. Last (Inchon) decommissioned 2002 after 32 years service.

**Note:** LPH-1 was USS Boxer (CV-21), converted Essex-class carrier (1959). Iwo Jima-class were first purpose-built LPH ships.
