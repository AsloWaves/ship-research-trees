**First C3 APAs** - Crescent City-class were first attack transports based on C3 merchant hull. 4 ships. Earned 33 battle stars collectively, served from Guadalcanal through Okinawa.

**Key Specs:** 8,889/14,247 tons | 491ft | 18-19 kn | 1,200-1,500 troops | 2,300-2,700 tons cargo | 4 ships

**Design:** Based on C3-P/C3-Delta Maritime Commission hull. Single-screw geared turbine (8,500 SHP). Originally classified AP-40, reclassified APA-21 on February 1, 1943. No two ships had identical armament configurations - varied from 3-4× 3-inch/50 to 1× 5-inch/38, plus various 40mm and 20mm AA guns. Built by Bethlehem Steel, Sparrows Point, Maryland.

**Ships:**
- **USS Crescent City (APA-21)** - Commissioned October 10, 1941, earned 10 battle stars, shot down 8 Japanese aircraft, decommissioned 1946
- **USS Charles Carroll (APA-28)** - Commissioned August 1942
- **USS Monrovia (APA-31)** - Commissioned September 1942
- **USS Calvert (APA-32)** - Commissioned December 1942

**Service:** Served from Guadalcanal through Okinawa. USS Crescent City traveled 160,000 miles and transported 90,000 men during war. Class earned 33 battle stars and 2 Navy Unit Commendations collectively. Participated in all major Pacific and some European amphibious operations. Troop capacity 1,200-1,500, cargo capacity 2,300-2,700 tons. Carried LCVPs and LCMs for beach assault.

**Combat Record:** USS Crescent City shot down 8 Japanese aircraft during Pacific operations. Ships provided fire support, troop transport, and command facilities for amphibious assaults. Reliable C3 hull proved suitable for conversion to attack transport role.

**Legacy:** First C3-based APAs established template for Arthur Middleton and Bayfield classes. Demonstrated effectiveness of C3 hull for attack transport conversions. Long wartime service validated design approach. Led directly to much larger Bayfield and Haskell production programs.
