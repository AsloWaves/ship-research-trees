**Final LKA Design** - Charleston-class were last purpose-built amphibious cargo ships for US Navy. 5 ships. Purpose-built rather than converted, served Amphibious Readiness Groups 1968-1994.

**Key Specs:** 10,216/18,648 tons | 576ft | 22 kn | Purpose-built LKA design | 5 ships

**Design:** Purpose-built amphibious cargo ships (not conversions like earlier AKA/LKAs). Steam turbine propulsion (22,000 SHP single shaft) provided 22-knot speed, faster than WWII-era cargo ships. Built by Newport News Shipbuilding 1968-1970. Four 3-inch/50 cal DP guns, later upgraded with Phalanx CIWS for missile defense.

**Ships:**
- **USS Charleston (AKA-113/LKA-113)** - Commissioned 1968, redesignated LKA-113 January 1, 1969
- **USS Durham (LKA-114)** - Commissioned 1969
- **USS Mobile (AKA-115/LKA-115)** - Laid down January 15, 1968, commissioned 1969
- **USS St. Louis (LKA-116)** - Commissioned 1969
- **USS El Paso (AKA-117/LKA-117)** - Commissioned 1970

**Service:** Served in Amphibious Readiness Groups 1968-1994. Vietnam War and post-Vietnam expeditionary operations. Larger and faster than WWII-era C2 conversions. Final dedicated amphibious cargo ship design before mission shifted to multi-purpose amphibious ships (LPDs, LSDs). All decommissioned 1992-1994.

**Cargo Operations:** Carried combat-loaded cargo including vehicles, ammunition, and supplies. Landing craft for ship-to-shore transfer. Supported Marine Expeditionary Units during Cold War. Purpose-built design optimized for amphibious cargo operations rather than adapted from merchant hulls.

**Legacy:** Last dedicated LKA class. End of specialized amphibious cargo ship lineage. Functions later absorbed by multi-purpose amphibious ships (San Antonio-class LPD, Whidbey Island-class LSD). Demonstrated peak of dedicated cargo ship design before naval amphibious forces shifted to more versatile platforms.
