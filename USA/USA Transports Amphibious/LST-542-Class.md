**Improved WWII LST** - LST-542-class were improved Type II LSTs with hydraulic bow doors, internal ramps, and enhanced systems. 609 ships. Major production class serving through Vietnam War.

**Key Specs:** 1,650/4,080 tons | 328ft | 11-12 kn | 140 troops | 1,900 tons cargo | 609 ships

**Design:** Type II LST improved design with major enhancements over LST-1 class. Hydraulic bow door machinery replaced mechanical screw gear for faster, more reliable operation. Internal ramp system (12×32 ft) between tank and main decks eliminated slow elevators from LST-513 onward. 6 landing craft davits (increased from 2). Reinforced main deck could carry LCT landing craft.

**Improvements:** Navigation bridge and conning station added for better ship handling. Water distillation plant (4,000 imperial gallons/day) improved crew habitability. Tank deck ventilator tubes removed from main deck center, improving deck space utilization. 3-inch/50 cal gun standard fit enhanced defensive capability. Overall displacement increased to 4,080 tons full load vs. 3,960 tons on LST-1.

**Landing Capability:** Bow doors (14 ft width, clamshell design) with hydraulic operation. 68-foot double-section bow ramp for direct beach access. Flat bottom hull with shallow 3.8-foot forward draft for beaching. Ballast tank system and bow anchor/winch for self-extraction. Could carry 20 M4 Sherman tanks on tank deck.

**Combat Record:** Extensive WWII service in European (Normandy, Southern France 1944-1945) and Pacific theaters (Philippines, Iwo Jima, Okinawa 1944-1945). Korean War amphibious operations (1950-1953). Vietnam War coastal support operations. Individual ships earned 2-5 battle stars. Lead ship USS LST-542 renamed USS Chelan County (July 1, 1955) had extensive post-war service.

**Legacy:** Major WWII production class with 609 ships built. Hydraulic bow doors and internal ramps became standard for future LST designs. Many transferred to allied navies post-war. Several served into 1970s. Multiple ships sold to Japan, South Korea, and other nations. Established improved LST template bridging WWII to post-war designs.
