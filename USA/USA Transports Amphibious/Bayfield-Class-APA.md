**Primary APA Class** - Bayfield-class were the first attack transports built in substantial numbers. 34 ships based on C3-S-A2 merchant hull. Second most numerous APA class after Haskell.

**Key Specs:** 8,100/16,100 tons | 492ft | 18.4 kn | 1,500 troops | 2,000 tons cargo | 34 ships

**Design:** Based on C3-S-A2 Maritime Commission hull design. Single screw geared turbine propulsion. Equipped with 15-33 LCVPs and 2-4 LCMs for beach assault operations. Dual 5-inch/38 guns provided fire support during amphibious landings.

**Ships (select):** USS Bayfield (APA-33), USS Bolivar (APA-34), USS Callaway (APA-35), USS Cambria (APA-36), USS Cavalier (APA-37), USS Chilton (APA-38), and 28 others. Many named for US counties.

**Service:** Participated in all major Pacific and European amphibious operations 1943-1945. Many ships served through Korean War and Vietnam War. Distinguished service at Normandy, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Philippines campaigns. Class earned numerous battle stars collectively.

**Design Evolution:** Standardized attack transport layout with troop berthing, cargo holds, landing craft davits, and fire support weapons. Originally designated AP-78 through AP-101, redesignated APA in 1943. Proved reliable and effective design for amphibious warfare.

**Legacy:** Established template for attack transport operations. Many ships had 20+ year service lives. Some served as late as Vietnam War providing troop transport and command facilities for amphibious operations.
