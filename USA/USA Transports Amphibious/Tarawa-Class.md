**First Multi-Purpose Assault Ships** - Tarawa-class were first true multi-purpose amphibious assault ships. 5 ships. Combined aviation (helicopters + Harriers), landing craft, and vehicle capacity. Served 1976-2014.

**Key Specs:** 39,400/40,722 tons | 820ft | 24 kn | 19 CH-46 + 4 CH-53 + 6 AV-8B Harrier | 4 LCU or 2 LCAC | 1,900 Marines | 5 ships

**Innovation:** First "general purpose" amphibious assault ship combining capabilities: helicopter assault (like LPH), well deck for landing craft (like LPD), vehicle storage, and V/STOL fighter operations (AV-8B Harrier). Larger and more capable than earlier Iwo Jima-class LPH.

**Design:** Full-length flight deck with island superstructure. Hangar deck below. Well deck aft for landing craft. Vehicle storage decks. Can embark 1,900 Marines. Hospital facilities. Command facilities for amphibious task force.

**Ships:**
- **Tarawa (LHA-1)** - Commissioned 1976, decommissioned 2009
- **Saipan (LHA-2)** - Commissioned 1977, decommissioned 2007
- **Belleau Wood (LHA-3)** - Commissioned 1978, decommissioned 2005
- **Nassau (LHA-4)** - Commissioned 1979, decommissioned 2011
- **Peleliu (LHA-5)** - Commissioned 1980, decommissioned 2015 (last)

**Air Group:**
- 19× CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters
- 4× CH-53 Sea Stallion heavy-lift helicopters
- 6× AV-8B Harrier II V/STOL fighters
- Or various mixes of CH-53, UH-1, AH-1, MV-22

**Amphibious Capability:**
- Well deck: 4 LCU or 2 LCAC hovercraft
- 60+ AAV7 amphibious assault vehicles
- Landing craft and vehicles for beach assault

**Service:** Cold War operations. Persian Gulf War 1991. Somalia operations 1990s. Afghanistan/Iraq 2001-2011. Humanitarian missions worldwide. All decommissioned 2005-2015, replaced by Wasp-class.

**Legacy:** Template for all future US amphibious assault ships. Multi-purpose concept (aviation + landing craft + vehicles) proven successful. Led directly to improved Wasp-class.
