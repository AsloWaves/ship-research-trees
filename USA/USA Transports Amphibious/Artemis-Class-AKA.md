**Shallow-Draft Cargo Ships** - Artemis-class were purpose-built attack cargo ships with shallow 15-foot draft for Pacific operations. 32 ships. First dedicated AKA class with specialized design.

**Key Specs:** 4,087/6,740 tons | 426ft | 18 kn | 4,450 tons cargo | 850 passengers | 32 ships

**Design:** Based on S4-SE2-BE1 Maritime Commission design. Much shallower 15-foot draft than other AKA classes allowed operations in restricted harbors and close to beaches. Lower main deck aft distinguished design from other cargo ships. Twin-screw geared turbine provided 18-knot speed. Carried 13 LCVPs and 1 LCP(L) for cargo transfer to shore.

**Ships:** USS Artemis (AKA-21), USS Athene (AKA-22), USS Aurelia (AKA-23), USS Birgit (AKA-24), USS Circe (AKA-25), and 27 others. Most named after mythological figures or stars. Two ships (USS Pamina/Tanner AKA-34 and USS Maury) converted to survey ships (AGS-15, AGS-16).

**Service:** Commissioned 1944-1945 for Pacific amphibious operations. Carried combat-loaded cargo including vehicles, ammunition, and supplies. Operated in conjunction with attack transports (APAs) during island-hopping campaign. Most decommissioned shortly after war (1946-1947), though some saw Korean War service.

**Cargo Capacity:** 4,450 deadweight tons of combat cargo. Could carry 850 passengers/troops. Combination of cargo capacity and landing craft allowed direct ship-to-shore logistics without pier facilities.

**Legacy:** Demonstrated value of specialized shallow-draft cargo ships for amphibious operations. Design influenced by Pacific Theater requirements for operations in coral atolls and restricted harbors. Larger Tolland-class AKAs followed with C2 hull design and greater capacity.
