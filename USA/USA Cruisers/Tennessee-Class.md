**Heaviest-Armed Armored Cruisers** - Tennessee-class mounted 10-inch guns, the largest carried by any US armored cruiser. Represented the pinnacle of pre-dreadnought armored cruiser design.

**Game Changers:**
- üéØ **10-inch Main Guns** - Heaviest on any US armored cruiser
- üìà **14,500 Tons** - Even larger than Pennsylvania-class
- üõ°Ô∏è **9-inch Turret Armor** - Enhanced protection
- üéñÔ∏è **4 Ships** - Substantial class

**vs [[USA/USA Cruisers/Pennsylvania-Class]]:** +820t | 8"‚Üí**10" main guns** | +2√ó 6" guns | Heavier turret armor

**Ships of the Class:**
- **Tennessee (ACR-10)** - Later CA-10, renamed Memphis (1916)
- **Washington (ACR-11)** - Later CA-11, renamed Seattle (1916)
- **North Carolina (ACR-12)** - Later CA-12, renamed Charlotte (1920)
- **Montana (ACR-13)** - Later CA-13, renamed Missoula (1920)

**Armament - Heaviest Battery:**
- **Main Battery:** 4√ó 10-inch/40 cal guns (2√ó twin turrets)
  - **Unique:** Largest guns on US armored cruiser
  - **Range:** Greater than 8-inch
  - **Purpose:** Fight enemy armored cruisers at longer range
- **Secondary:** 16√ó 6-inch/50 cal guns (casemates)
- **Tertiary:** 22√ó 3-inch/50 cal rapid-fire
- **Light Guns:** 12√ó 3-pdr, 2√ó 1-pdr
- **Torpedoes:** 4√ó 21-inch tubes (2 submerged, 2 above water)

**Armor:**
- **Belt:** 5 inches (Harvey armor)
- **Deck:** 1.5-3 inches
- **Turrets:** 9 inches (main battery) - heavier than Pennsylvania
- **Casemates:** 5 inches
- **Conning Tower:** 9 inches

**Propulsion:**
- **Engines:** 2√ó vertical triple-expansion engines
- **Boilers:** 32√ó Babcock & Wilcox water-tube
- **Power:** 23,500 ihp
- **Speed:** 22.16 knots (trials)
- **Coal:** 2,290 tons normal
- **Range:** 10,000 nm @ 10 knots

**Design Philosophy - "Super Armored Cruiser":**
The Tennessee-class represented an attempt to create armored cruisers powerful enough to engage battleships if necessary:
- 10-inch guns approached light battleship armament
- Heavy turret armor for direct combat
- Large size for seakeeping and endurance

**Service Highlights:**
- **Pre-WWI:** Fleet service, world cruise demonstrations
- **WWI:** Various patrol and training duties
- **1916:** Tennessee/Washington renamed to free names for battleships
- **1920:** Redesignated ACR ‚Üí CA
- **Fate:** Most decommissioned 1920s after Washington Naval Treaty

**Notable Incident - Memphis (ex-Tennessee):**
- **August 29, 1916:** Destroyed by freak waves in Dominican Republic
- **Anchored off Santo Domingo:** Hit by series of massive waves
- **Result:** Wrecked, declared total loss
- **Casualties:** 40 dead
- **Cause:** Still debated - possible tsunami or seismic waves

**Obsolescence:**
- **Battlecruisers:** Made armored cruisers obsolete for fleet actions
- **Dreadnoughts:** Outgunned armored cruisers
- **Treaty Cruisers:** New generation made them irrelevant
- **Washington Treaty (1922):** Led to scrapping of survivors

**Legacy:** Tennessee-class represented the apex and end of armored cruiser development. The 10-inch guns were never surpassed on a US cruiser. By WWI, the type was obsolete, replaced by fast battleships and battlecruisers.
