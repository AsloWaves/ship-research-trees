**US Battlecruisers** - Alaska-class were large cruisers (CB) with 12-inch guns. Only 2 of 6 completed. Too expensive, arrived late in war.

**Key Specs:** 27,000t | 808ft | 33kn | 9× 12"/50 Mark 8 guns | 2 ships (Alaska, Guam)

**Ships:** Alaska (CB-1), Guam (CB-2). Hawaii (CB-3) partially completed, scrapped. Philippines (CB-4), CB-5, CB-6 cancelled.

**Design:** Designed to counter Japanese large cruisers. Bigger than heavy cruiser, smaller than battleship. 9-inch belt armor.

**Service:** Short service life (1944-1947). Expensive to operate, unclear role after WWII ended. No combat engagements.
