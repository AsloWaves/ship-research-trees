**Cancelled Nuclear Frigate** - Typhon DLGN was revolutionary nuclear-powered guided missile frigate designed around advanced Typhon weapons system. First phased-array radar on frigate. Multiple simultaneous target capability. Cancelled January 1964 due to radar system failures and escalating costs.

**Key Specs (Proposed):** 10,000-12,000 tons | 600ft | 30+ kn | 140 Typhon missiles | AN/SPG-59 phased array | 2 nuclear reactors | CANCELLED

**Innovation:** First frigate with phased-array radar system (AN/SPG-59). Multiple simultaneous target engagement. Revolutionary Typhon missile system for long-range and medium-range air defense. Electronic scanning radar with 3,400 antenna elements. Nuclear propulsion for unlimited range.

**Program Origins (1957-1963):**
- **Late 1950s:** Navy sought advanced air defense against Soviet missiles
- **Typhon concept:** Revolutionary missile/radar system for simultaneous targets
- **Secretary McNamara (1962):** Proposed first nuclear frigate for 1963 budget
- **Mission:** "Defend carrier force against weapons coming into operation after 1965"
- **Escalating threat:** Soviet cruise missiles and bombers

**AN/SPG-59 Radar System:**
- **Technology:** Electronically scanned phased-array radar
- **Luneburg Lens:** 3,400 antenna elements (DLGN version)
- **Limitation:** Operated only intermittently (10% of time)
- **Problem:** "Ship needed separate conventional air search radar for remaining 90%"
- **Size:** Required large ship (600+ feet) for power and volume
- **Power hungry:** Nuclear reactors needed to supply radar energy

**Typhon Missile System:**
- **Long-range launcher:** 1× launcher with 60 missiles (including ASROC)
- **Medium-range launchers:** 2× launchers with 40 missiles each (80 total)
- **Total missiles:** 140 missiles (unprecedented capacity)
- **Capability:** "First system capable of simultaneously taking multiple targets under fire"
- **Range:** Long-range and medium-range air defense
- **Tracking:** Could track many more targets than could engage

**Ship Design (Proposed):**
- **Hull length:** 600 feet
- **Displacement:** 10,000-12,000 tons (large frigate/small cruiser)
- **Propulsion:** 2× D2G nuclear reactors (similar to Bainbridge CGN-25)
- **Speed:** 30+ knots
- **Armament:** Typhon missiles, ASROC anti-submarine missiles
- **Crew:** 400-500 (estimated, with reactor crew)

**Development Timeline:**
- **1957-1960:** Typhon weapons system development begins
- **June 1962:** USS Norton Sound modified to test prototype systems
- **November 1962:** Secretary of Navy cancelled Typhon cruiser from 1963 program
- **FY 1963:** Nuclear frigate (DLGN) requested in budget
- **January 7, 1964:** Secretary McNamara cancelled entire Typhon program

**Why Typhon Failed:**
1. **Radar failures:** AN/SPG-59 unreliable, lost signal strength in processing
2. **Too complex:** "Electronic state of the art not capable of providing necessary components"
3. **Too heavy:** Radar system too large and heavy for destroyers
4. **Cost overruns:** Escalating development costs
5. **Alternative systems:** Terrier, Talos, Tartar missiles being improved
6. **Size requirement:** Only deployable in large, expensive ships

**McNamara's Cancellation Rationale:**
- **Budget priority:** Resources redirected to fixing Terrier/Talos/Tartar deficiencies
- **Technology risk:** Electronic components not mature enough
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Cheaper to improve existing systems
- **Schedule delays:** Program running behind schedule
- **System integration:** Too complex for reliable operation

**What Happened Instead:**
- **Leahy-class (DLG/CG-16):** Conventional frigates with Terrier missiles
- **Belknap-class (DLG/CG-26):** Single-ended missile frigates
- **Advanced systems:** Later ships received improved radar and missiles
- **Aegis (1970s-1980s):** Eventually achieved Typhon's goals with SPY-1 radar

**Comparison to Built Ships:**
| Feature | Typhon DLGN (Cancelled) | Leahy CG-16 (Built) | Aegis Ticonderoga CG-47 (Built) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Displacement | 10,000-12,000 tons | 7,800 tons | 9,600 tons |
| Propulsion | Nuclear | Conventional | Gas turbine |
| Radar | SPG-59 phased array | SPS-48 conventional | SPY-1 phased array |
| Missiles | 140 Typhon | 80 Terrier | 122 Standard |
| IOC | Cancelled 1964 | 1962 | 1983 |

**Technology Legacy:**
Though Typhon failed, lessons learned contributed to:
- **Aegis development:** SPY-1 phased array radar (1970s-1980s)
- **Computer systems:** Improved digital processing for radar signals
- **Missile fire control:** Multiple simultaneous engagement concepts
- **System integration:** Better understanding of complex system challenges

**Norton Sound Test Ship:**
- **USS Norton Sound (AVM-1):** Modified June 1962 to test Typhon prototype
- **Testing period:** 1962-1964
- **Results:** Demonstrated concept but revealed technical problems
- **Fate:** Typhon systems removed after cancellation, ship continued as test vessel

**Impact on Navy:**
- **Procurement strategy:** More conservative approach to revolutionary systems
- **Incremental improvements:** Focus on evolving existing systems (Terrier → Standard)
- **Risk management:** Avoid betting on unproven technologies
- **Budget awareness:** Cost control became higher priority
- **Aegis lesson:** Next-generation system had more mature technology base

**What-If Typhon Succeeded:**
Had technology been mature enough:
- Commissioned 1965-1970 era
- Revolutionary air defense capability 15 years early
- Multiple simultaneous target engagement in 1960s
- Nuclear-powered escort fleet (expensive)
- Probably would have struggled with reliability
- Likely overshadowed by later Aegis system anyway

**Foreign Interest:**
No foreign navies pursued Typhon technology due to:
- US cancellation signaled technical problems
- Too expensive and complex
- Conventional systems adequate for most navies
- Phased-array radar too immature in 1960s

**Modern Echo:**
Typhon's goals eventually achieved by:
- **Aegis SPY-1 (1980s):** Phased-array radar, multiple target engagement
- **AMDR SPY-6 (2020s):** Next-generation phased array for DDG-51 Flight III
- **Cooperative Engagement:** Networked air defense beyond single-ship capability

**Legacy:**
- Demonstrated ambition of 1960s Navy for advanced technology
- Showed importance of mature technology before major procurement
- Lessons influenced Aegis development 15 years later
- Warned against revolutionary vs evolutionary approach
- Typhon concept was correct, technology was too early
