**First Purpose-Built Missile Cruisers** - Leahy-class were first US cruisers designed from keel up as guided missile ships. Double-ended Terrier configuration.

**Key Specs:** 5,670t | 533ft | 32kn | Terrier SAM + ASROC | No armor | 9 ships (Leahy, Halsey, Reeves, et al., CG-16 to CG-24)

**Design:** No gun main battery, twin Terrier launchers fore and aft (80 missiles total). ASROC ASW system. 4× 3-inch for CIWS.

**Innovation:** Purpose-built missile cruisers (not conversions). Double-ended layout became standard. Lighter, faster than conversions.

**Ships:** Leahy, Halsey, Reeves, Worden, Dale, Richmond K. Turner, Gridley, England, Harry E. Yarnell (CG-16 to CG-24)
