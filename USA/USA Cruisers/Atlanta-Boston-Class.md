**"New Navy" - First Steel Warships** - USS Atlanta and Boston were the first steel warships of the US Navy, marking the transition from the "Old Navy" to the "New Navy." Part of the famous "ABCD ships" program.

**Game Changers:**
- üèóÔ∏è **First Steel Construction** - Revolutionary departure from wooden hulls
- ‚öì **"New Navy"** - Symbolized US naval modernization
- üéØ **8-inch Guns** - Heavy armament for protected cruiser
- üõ°Ô∏è **Protected Cruiser Design** - Armored deck instead of side armor
- ‚õµ **Sail Rigging** - Still carried sails for extended range

**"ABCD Ships" Program:**
- **A**tlanta (Protected Cruiser)
- **B**oston (Protected Cruiser)
- **C**hicago (Protected Cruiser)
- **D**olphin (Dispatch Vessel)

**Armament:**
- **Main Battery:** 2√ó 8-inch/30 cal Mark 1 guns (open barbettes)
- **Secondary:** 6√ó 6-inch/30 cal Mark 2 guns
- **Light Guns:** 2√ó 6-pdr, 2√ó 3-pdr Hotchkiss, 2√ó 1-pdr Hotchkiss
- **Machine Guns:** 2√ó .45 cal Gatling guns

**Armor (Protected Cruiser Concept):**
- **Deck:** 1.5 inches (protected vital spaces from plunging fire)
- **Barbettes:** 2 inches
- **Conning Tower:** 2 inches
- **No side armor** - relied on armored deck and coal bunkers

**Propulsion:**
- **Engine:** Horizontal compound steam engine
- **Boilers:** 8√ó coal-fired
- **Power:** 3,500 ihp
- **Speed:** 16.3 knots (trials), 13 knots (design)
- **Range:** 3,390 nm @ 10 knots
- **Unique:** Originally carried sail rigging

**Service Timeline:**
- **USS Atlanta:** 1886-1912 (26 years)
- **USS Boston:** 1887-1946 (59 years, including museum ship)

**Historical Significance:**
- Represented US emergence as modern naval power
- Steel construction proved revolutionary
- Protected cruiser design influenced future classes
- Boston became longest-serving ABCD ship

**"Protected Cruiser" Concept:**
Instead of heavy side armor (like armored cruisers), protected cruisers had:
- Armored deck over machinery/magazines
- Coal bunkers as side protection
- Lighter, faster design
- Better for commerce raiding and scouting

**Legacy:** These ships proved the viability of steel construction and established the template for the protected cruiser type that would dominate through WWI.
