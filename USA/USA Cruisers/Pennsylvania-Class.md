**First Modern Armored Cruisers** - Pennsylvania-class represented the US Navy's first large-scale armored cruiser program with heavy side armor and powerful mixed battery.

**Game Changers:**
- üèóÔ∏è **13,680 Tons** - More than double Olympia's displacement
- üõ°Ô∏è **5-6 Inch Belt Armor** - True armored cruiser protection
- üéØ **Mixed Battery** - 4√ó 8" + 14√ó 6" guns
- ‚õΩ **10,000nm Range** - True ocean-going capability
- üè≠ **5 Ships** - First large armored cruiser class

**vs [[Olympia-Class]]:** +8,094t | +160 ft | **Heavy side armor** | More firepower | Greater range

**Ships of the Class:**
- **Pennsylvania (ACR-4)** - Later CA-4
- **West Virginia (ACR-5)** - Later CA-5
- **California (ACR-6)** - Later CA-6
- **Colorado (ACR-7)** - Later CA-7
- **Maryland (ACR-8)** - Later CA-8

**Armament:**
- **Main Battery:** 4√ó 8-inch/45 cal guns (2√ó twin turrets)
- **Secondary:** 14√ó 6-inch/50 cal guns (casemates)
- **Tertiary:** 18√ó 3-inch/50 cal rapid-fire guns
- **Light Guns:** 12√ó 3-pdr, 2√ó 1-pdr
- **Torpedoes:** 2√ó 21-inch submerged tubes

**Armor - True Armored Cruiser:**
- **Belt:** 5-6 inches (Harvey armor)
- **Deck:** 1.5-3 inches
- **Turrets:** 6.5 inches (main battery)
- **Casemates:** 5 inches (6-inch guns)
- **Conning Tower:** 9 inches

**vs Protected Cruisers:**
Protected cruisers had armored decks only; armored cruisers added heavy side belts for direct fire protection.

**Propulsion:**
- **Engines:** 2√ó vertical triple-expansion engines
- **Boilers:** 32√ó Babcock & Wilcox water-tube
- **Power:** 23,000 ihp
- **Speed:** 22.47 knots (trials), 22 knots (design)
- **Coal:** 2,025 tons normal, 2,800 tons max
- **Range:** 10,000 nm @ 10 knots

**Service:**
- **Spanish-American War Era:** Built just after
- **WWI:** Various patrol and training duties
- **Redesignation (1920):** ACR ‚Üí CA (Heavy Cruiser)
- **Decommissioned:** 1920s-1930s

**Design Philosophy:**
- Fast enough to scout for battle fleet
- Armored to fight enemy armored cruisers
- Mixed battery for multiple engagement ranges
- Long range for independent operations

**"Armored Cruiser" Role:**
- **Before Battlecruisers:** Filled fast capital ship role
- **Fleet Screening:** Scouted ahead of battleships
- **Commerce Raiding:** Could destroy merchant raiders
- **Colony Defense:** Showed flag in distant waters

**Legacy:** Pennsylvania-class established the US armored cruiser template. Later eclipsed by battlecruisers and treaty heavy cruisers, but pioneered large armored warship construction.
