**Natural Circulation Reactor** - Narwhal (SSN-671) tested S5G natural circulation reactor. Eliminated noisy reactor coolant pumps for improved stealth.

**Key Specs:** 4450/5350 tons | 314ft | 20/25+ kn | 4× 21" tubes | S5G natural circulation reactor | 1 boat (Narwhal SSN-671)

**Innovation:** S5G reactor used natural circulation (no pumps at slow speeds). Quieter than conventional reactors. Technology used in Ohio-class SSBNs.

**Service:** Cold War ASW 1969-1999. Proved natural circulation concept. Decommissioned 1999.
