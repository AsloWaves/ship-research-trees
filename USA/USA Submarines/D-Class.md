**First Diesel Submarines** - D-class were first US submarines with diesel engines. Revolutionary improvement over dangerous gasoline engines. 3 boats built.

**Key Specs:** 288/337 tons | 135ft | 12/9.5kn | 4× 18" torpedo tubes | Diesel/electric | 3 boats (Narwhal, Grayling, Salmon)

**Innovation:** First US diesel-electric submarines. Diesel engines eliminated gasoline fume dangers. Four torpedo tubes. Much longer range (2,500nm).

**Service:** Pre-WWI and WWI training. All decommissioned 1920-1922.
