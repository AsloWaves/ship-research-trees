**Last Diesel Attack Subs** - Barbel-class were last diesel-electric attack submarines built by US Navy. 3 boats with Albacore teardrop hull.

**Key Specs:** 2146/2895 tons | 219ft | 18/25kn | 6× 21" tubes | 3 boats (Barbel, Blueback, Bonefish)

**Innovation:** True teardrop hull based on USS Albacore. Fastest diesel submarines (25 knots submerged). Single screw. Last US diesel attack subs - all future submarines were nuclear.

**Service:** Cold War patrols 1959-1990. Blueback last diesel submarine in US service (decommissioned October 1990). Blueback preserved as museum ship in Portland, OR.
