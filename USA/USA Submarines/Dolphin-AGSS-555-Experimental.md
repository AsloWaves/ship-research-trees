**Deep Diving Research Submarine** - USS Dolphin was the deepest diving US submarine, establishing world depth record exceeding 3,000 feet. Purpose-built for deep diving research and development. 38-year career (longest for US sub at that time). Tested advanced submarine structures, sensors, weapons, and systems at extreme depths.

**Key Specs:** 800/930 tons | 152ft | 10-15 kn | 3,000+ ft depth | 25 crew + scientists | 12+ tons payload | EXPERIMENTAL

**Innovation:** Deepest diving operating submarine in the world (3,000+ feet test depth). Unique constant-diameter pressure hull with deep frames instead of bulkheads. Deepest torpedo launch in history (August 1969). 38-year research career. Extensive instrumentation for acoustic, structural, and weapons testing at extreme depths.

**Construction:**
- **Keel laid:** November 9, 1962, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine
- **Launched:** June 8, 1968
- **Commissioned:** August 17, 1968
- **Cost:** ~$15 million (1960s dollars)
- **Purpose:** Deep diving research and development
- **Design:** Constant-diameter cylinder with hemispherical ends

**World Depth Record:**
- **Test depth:** 3,000+ feet (exact depth classified)
- **Achievement:** World record for operating submarines
- **Comparison:** Contemporary attack submarines: 600-1,300 feet
- **Significance:** Doubled or tripled conventional submarine depths
- **Duration:** Record held for decades

**Revolutionary Pressure Hull:**
- **Design:** Constant-diameter cylinder (19 feet diameter)
- **Material:** HY-80 high-strength steel (80,000 psi yield)
- **Construction:** Hemispherical heads at each end
- **Frames:** Deep frames instead of traditional bulkheads
- **Philosophy:** Simplicity for structural experiments
- **Result:** Maximum strength-to-weight ratio for deep diving

**Deep Frames Innovation:**
Instead of traditional bulkheads dividing the hull into compartments, Dolphin used "deep frames" - strong rings that support the pressure hull from inside without creating separate compartments. This design:
- Allowed full-length pressure hull without interruptions
- Maximized usable internal volume
- Simplified structural testing
- Enabled installation of large scientific equipment
- Permitted structural strain measurements

**Scientific Payload Capacity:**
- **Capacity:** 12+ tons of scientific equipment
- **Comparison:** Greater than any other deep diving research vessel

- **Support:** Extensive power and data connections
- **Value:** Enabled wide variety of research missions

**Research Missions:**
Over 38 years, Dolphin conducted:
- **Acoustic research:** Deep-water and littoral sound propagation
- **Near-bottom surveys:** Ocean floor mapping and surveys
- **Weapons launches:** Torpedo testing at extreme depths

- **Strain gauges:** Measured hull deformation under pressure
- **Fatigue testing:** Cyclic pressure loading over decades
- **Material properties:** HY-80 steel performance validation
- **Joint integrity:** Weld and connection testing
- **Design validation:** Proved deep-frame concept
- **Future designs:** Informed later submarine construction
