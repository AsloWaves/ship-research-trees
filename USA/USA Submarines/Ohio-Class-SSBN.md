**Largest US Submarines** - Ohio-class are largest US submarines ever built. 18 boats total: 14 Trident II SSBNs + 4 converted to Tomahawk SSGNs. Backbone of nuclear deterrent.

**Key Specs:** 16764/18750 tons | 560ft | 12/25+ kn | 24× Trident II D5 (SSBN) or 154× Tomahawk (SSGN) | S8G reactor | 18 boats

**SSBN Configuration (14 boats):** 24 Trident II D5 missiles, each with 8 MIRV warheads (192 warheads per boat). Ohio, Michigan, Florida, Georgia converted to SSGN 2002-2008.

**SSGN Configuration (4 boats):** 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles + SEAL delivery vehicle. Ohio SSGN-726, Michigan SSGN-727, Florida SSGN-728, Georgia SSGN-729.

**Innovation:** Largest submarines, quietest SSBNs, natural circulation reactor. Four SSBNs converted to SSGNs under START I treaty (2002-2008). SSGNs provide massive strike capability (154 Tomahawks) + special operations.

**Service:** Strategic deterrent 1981-present. 12 SSBNs active (2 decommissioned). 4 SSGNs active. Combat deployments: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria. Ohio and Michigan scheduled for retirement 2026-2027. All SSBNs being replaced by Columbia-class 2030s.
