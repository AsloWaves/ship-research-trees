**Continued Development** - F-class submarines carried more torpedoes (8 total). 4 boats built. Continued diesel-electric development.

**Key Specs:** 330/400 tons | 142ft | 13.5/11.5kn | 4× 18" torpedo tubes, 8 torpedoes | Diesel/electric | 4 boats (Carp, Barracuda, Pickerel, Skate)

**Design:** Similar to E-class but larger and carrying 8 torpedoes vs 4. Improved endurance for coastal patrol.

**Service:** WWI and post-war training. F-1 sank after collision 1917 with loss of 19 crew. Others decommissioned 1922.
