**Revolutionary Design** - Skipjack-class combined nuclear power with Albacore teardrop hull. 6 boats. First to exceed 30 knots submerged (33+ knots). Template for all future SSNs.

**Key Specs:** 3075/3513 tons | 251ft | 16/33+ kn | 6× 21" tubes | S5W reactor | Single screw | 6 boats

**Innovation:** Teardrop hull + nuclear power = revolutionary speed (33+ knots submerged). Single screw. Became template for all future attack submarines. "World's fastest submarine" when commissioned.

**Service:** Cold War deterrent 1959-1990s. Scorpion (SSN-589) lost with all hands 1968. Others decommissioned 1986-1990.
