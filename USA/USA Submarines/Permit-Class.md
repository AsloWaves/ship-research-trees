**Second Generation SSNs** - Permit-class (originally Thresher-class) were quieter, deeper-diving submarines with advanced sonar. 14 boats. Renamed after Thresher loss.

**Key Specs:** 3750/4311 tons | 278ft | 18/27+ kn | 4× 21" tubes (amidships) | BQQ-2 sonar | 14 boats

**Innovation:** Designed around large bow-mounted BQQ-2 sonar. Amidships torpedo tubes. Improved quieting. Deeper diving (1300ft test depth).

**Service:** Cold War ASW 1961-2000s. Thresher (SSN-593) lost with all hands 1963 during sea trials (129 dead). Class renamed Permit-class. SubSafe program created after disaster.
