**First Post-War Design** - Tang-class were first post-WWII designed attack submarines. 6 boats. Streamlined hull for 18+ knot submerged speed.

**Key Specs:** 2050/2700 tons | 269ft | 15.5/18.3kn | 8× 21" tubes, 24 torpedoes | 6 boats

**Innovation:** Revolutionary streamlined design based on German Type XXI. High submerged speed (18.3 knots). GUPPY concepts applied to new construction. No deck gun.

**Service:** Cold War deterrent. All served 1950s-1970s. Several foreign transfers (Turkey, Iran). Decommissioned 1980.
