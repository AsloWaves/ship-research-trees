**Most Numerous Class** - Balao-class were most numerous US submarine class ever. 120 boats completed. Improved Gato with thicker hull for deeper diving (400ft).

**Key Specs:** 1526/2424 tons | 311ft | 20/8.75kn | 10× 21" tubes, 24 torpedoes + deck guns | 120 boats

**Innovation:** Thicker pressure hull (increased test depth from 300ft to 400ft). Otherwise nearly identical to Gato. Massive wartime production across 5 shipyards.

**Service:** Late WWII and post-war. Many converted to GUPPY (Greater Underwater Propulsion Power) streamlined submarines 1947-1963. Extensive Cold War service. Several foreign sales. Museum ships include Lionfish, Clamagore, Becuna, Pampanito, Bowfin.
