**First Production Nuclear Subs** - Skate-class were first production nuclear attack submarines. 4 boats. Smaller, more economical than Nautilus.

**Key Specs:** 2570/2861 tons | 267ft | 20/20+ kn | 8× 21" tubes | S3W/S4W reactors | 4 boats (Skate, Swordfish, Sargo, Seadragon)

**Innovation:** First production SSNs. Skate surfaced at North Pole (1959). More compact and economical than Nautilus.

**Service:** Cold War patrols 1957-1989. Skate first to surface at North Pole. All decommissioned 1986-1989.
