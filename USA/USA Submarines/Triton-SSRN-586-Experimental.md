**Experimental Radar Picket Submarine** - USS Triton was the only nuclear-powered radar picket submarine and only Western submarine with two nuclear reactors. Largest US submarine until Ohio-class (1981). First vessel to complete submerged circumnavigation of Earth (Operation Sandblast, 1960). Mission made obsolete by carrier-based E-2 Hawkeye aircraft. Reclassified as attack submarine 1961.

**Key Specs:** 5,963/7,773 tons | 447.5ft | 30+ kn | 172 crew | 2 nuclear reactors | Radar picket | EXPERIMENTAL

**Innovation:** Only nuclear-powered radar picket submarine ever built. Two S4G nuclear reactors (only Western sub with twin reactors). Largest US submarine for 22 years. First submerged circumnavigation of Earth (Operation Sandblast, 1960). Most expensive submarine of era ($109 million). Unique mission made obsolete by E-2 Hawkeye aircraft.

**Radar Picket Mission:**
Cold War early warning concept:
- **Role:** Advanced radar warning for carrier task forces
- **Concept:** Submarine surfaces ahead of fleet to provide radar coverage
- **Advantage:** Extends radar horizon beyond carrier's own radar
- **Radar:** AN/SPS-26 3D air search radar on large sail
- **Communications:** Extensive communications gear to relay warnings
- **Problem:** Vulnerable when surfaced with large radar sail

**Why Two Nuclear Reactors:**
Triton needed twin reactors because:
- **Size:** Large submarine (7,773 tons submerged)
- **Speed:** Required 30+ knots to keep up with carriers
- **Electronics:** Massive power requirements for radar and communications
- **Redundancy:** Mission-critical role required backup power
- **Only Western example:** No other Western sub had twin reactors
- **Soviet comparison:** Some Soviet subs also used twin reactors

**Construction:**
- **Authorized:** 1956
- **Keel laid:** May 29, 1956, Electric Boat, Groton, Connecticut
- **Launched:** August 19, 1958
- **Commissioned:** November 10, 1959
- **Cost:** $109 million (equivalent to $1.18 billion in 2024)
- **Reactors:** 2× S4G pressurized water reactors (45,000 SHP total)

**Record Size:**
- **Length:** 447.5 feet (longest US submarine)
- **Held record:** Until USS Ohio (SSBN-726) commissioned 1981
- **Comparison:** Skipjack-class (1959): 252 feet
- **Reason:** Large hull needed for radar equipment and twin reactors
- **Still exceeds:** Many modern attack submarines in size

**Operation Sandblast (1960):**
**First Submerged Circumnavigation of Earth**

**Mission:**
- **Dates:** February 16 - May 10, 1960 (84 days)
- **Route:** Following Magellan's historic route
- **Distance:** 41,519 miles
- **Depth:** Entirely submerged (periscope depth for navigation)
- **Command:** Captain Edward L. Beach
- **Crew:** 172 officers and men

**Route:**
1. Departed New London, Connecticut (February 16)
2. South Atlantic Ocean
3. Around Cape Horn (southern tip of South America)
4. Pacific Ocean
5. Philippines
6. Indian Ocean
7. Around Cape of Good Hope (southern tip of Africa)
8. North Atlantic Ocean
9. Returned to Delaware Capes (May 10, 1960)

**Significance:**
- **First submerged:** Nautilus transited North Pole, but not full circumnavigation
- **Historic parallel:** Follow Magellan's 1519-1522 route
- **Cold War demonstration:** US submarine endurance and capability
- **Presidential Unit Citation:** Awarded by President Eisenhower
- **Publicity:** Initially classified, revealed May 1960

**Surface Once:**
Triton surfaced only once during the 84-day voyage:
- **Location:** Off Montevideo, Uruguay
- **Reason:** Transfer sick crew member to shore
- **Duration:** Brief (less than 1 hour)
- **Controversy:** Some argue this breaks "submerged" record
- **Official:** US Navy counts it as continuous submerged voyage

**Speed Trials:**
- **September 27, 1959:** Initial sea trials
- **Result:** "Well in excess of 30 knots"
- **Comparison:** Fastest submarine of the era
- **Purpose:** Keep pace with carrier task forces (30+ knots)

**Obsolete at Birth:**
Triton's radar picket mission was obsolete almost immediately:
- **E-1B Tracer:** Carrier early warning aircraft introduced 1958
- **E-2 Hawkeye:** Advanced early warning aircraft introduced 1964
- **Advantages:** Aircraft fly higher, see farther, less vulnerable
- **Problem:** Submarine must surface to use radar (vulnerable)
- **Result:** SSR/SSRN mission phased out

**Reclassification:**
- **Original:** SSRN-586 (Nuclear Radar Picket Submarine)
- **March 1, 1961:** Reclassified SSN-586 (Attack Submarine)
- **Reason:** Radar picket mission ended
- **Problem:** Not well-suited as attack submarine
- **Size:** Too large, too expensive to operate as SSN
- **Career:** Brief service as attack submarine

**Operational Challenges:**
As an attack submarine, Triton had problems:
- **Too large:** 447 feet vs 252 feet for Skipjack-class
- **Too expensive:** $109M vs $40M for attack submarines
- **Crew:** 172 vs 90-100 for attack submarines
- **Design:** Optimized for surface radar operations, not combat
- **Speed:** Fast but not exceptionally maneuverable
- **Result:** Not cost-effective as SSN

**Service History (1959-1969):**
- **1959-1960:** Shakedown, Operation Sandblast
- **1960-1961:** Radar picket operations (limited)
- **1961:** Reclassified as attack submarine
- **1961-1969:** Attack submarine service
- **Limited deployment:** Not heavily used due to operating costs
- **Crew:** Special duty assignment (prestigious but unusual boat)

**Decommissioning:**
- **May 3, 1969:** Decommissioned (only 10 years service)
- **Reason:** Too expensive to operate, mission obsolete
- **Comparison:** Most subs serve 25-30+ years
- **Disposition:** Reactor compartment removed, scrapped
- **Legacy:** Unique experiment, lessons learned

**Why Radar Picket Submarines Failed:**
1. **Aircraft better:** Carrier planes fly higher, see farther
2. **Vulnerability:** Submarine must surface to use radar
3. **Expensive:** Nuclear power not cost-effective for mission
4. **Manning:** Huge crew for limited capability
5. **Tactical:** Submarine warfare doctrine moved away from surface operations
6. **Technology:** Satellites and aircraft made picket ships obsolete

**Comparison to Diesel Radar Picket Submarines:**
Before Triton, the US Navy converted diesel submarines:
- **SSR conversions:** Migraine conversions (1950s)
- **Limitations:** Slow, short endurance
- **Triton advantage:** Nuclear endurance, carrier-group speed
- **Result:** Still obsolete compared to aircraft

**Twin Reactor Legacy:**
Triton's twin S4G reactors:
- **Triton only:** No other US submarine used twin reactors
- **Soviet Navy:** Some Soviet submarines used twin reactors (Alfa, others)
- **US philosophy:** Single reactor sufficient for attack submarines
- **Ballistic submarines:** Ohio-class uses single S8G reactor (larger)
- **Result:** Twin reactors not adopted for US submarine force

**Largest Submarine Title:**
Triton held "largest US submarine" record for 22 years:
- **1959-1981:** Triton 447.5 ft, 7,773 tons
- **1981:** Ohio-class SSBN-726: 560 ft, 18,750 tons
- **Current:** Columbia-class (2031+) will be larger still
- **Attack submarines:** Triton still larger than many modern SSNs

**Lessons Learned:**
Triton demonstrated:
- **Mission flexibility:** Submarines need adaptable missions
- **Cost matters:** Very expensive vessels need clear roles
- **Technology timing:** Wait for mature technology (E-2 Hawkeye better)
- **Twin reactors:** Not necessary for US submarine designs
- **Size limits:** Bigger not always better for submarines

**Historic Significance:**
Despite short career, Triton is historically significant:
- **Operation Sandblast:** First submerged circumnavigation
- **Technological:** Twin nuclear reactors (unique in West)
- **Size record:** Largest US sub for over two decades
- **Experimental:** Proved radar picket concept didn't work
- **Cold War:** Demonstration of US submarine capabilities

**Presidential Unit Citation:**
Operation Sandblast earned:
- **Award:** Presidential Unit Citation
- **Presented by:** President Dwight D. Eisenhower
- **Date:** May 1960
- **Significance:** Entire crew recognized
- **Rare honor:** Peacetime citation for submarine

**Comparison to Soviet Radar Picket Submarines:**
Soviet Navy also experimented:
- **Project 940:** Diesel radar picket conversions
- **Limited success:** Similar problems to US SSRs
- **Abandoned:** Soviets also abandoned radar picket submarines
- **Aircraft:** Soviet naval aviation took over early warning
- **Parallel:** Both superpowers reached same conclusion

**Modern Equivalents:**
Today's early warning uses:
- **E-2D Hawkeye:** Carrier-based AEW aircraft
- **E-3 Sentry (AWACS):** Land-based early warning
- **Satellites:** Space-based early warning
- **SPY-6 radar:** Advanced ship-based radar
- **No submarines:** Mission completely abandoned

**What-If Triton Never Built:**
Without Triton:
- No submerged circumnavigation record (at that time)
- $109 million saved (2-3 more Skipjack-class built instead)
- Faster conclusion that aircraft better for early warning
- No twin-reactor experience in US Navy
- Less Cold War propaganda value

**Memorial and Recognition:**
- **No museum ship:** Scrapped after decommissioning
- **Operation Sandblast:** Well documented in naval history
- **Books:** Captain Beach wrote about circumnavigation
- **Legacy:** Remembered as unique experimental vessel
- **Lesson:** Sometimes experiments fail, still valuable
