**Most Advanced SSNs** - Seawolf-class were designed to hunt Soviet SSBNs. Most capable attack submarines ever built. Only 3 built due to high cost ($3B+ each).

**Key Specs:** 9137/12139 tons | 353ft | 20/35+ kn | 8× 30" tubes, 50 torpedoes/missiles | S6W reactor | 3 boats (Seawolf, Connecticut, Jimmy Carter)

**Innovation:** Quietest submarines ever (quieter than ocean background noise). Fastest SSNs (35+ knots). Eight 30-inch torpedo tubes. 50 weapon load. Designed to dominate Soviet submarines.

**Service:** Post-Cold War missions. Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) modified for special operations (2005, 100ft longer). All three active as elite SSNs. Based at Bangor, WA.
