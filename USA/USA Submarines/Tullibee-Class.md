**Quiet Submarine** - Tullibee (SSN-597) was experimental quiet submarine with turbo-electric drive. Quietest submarine when commissioned.

**Key Specs:** 2317/2640 tons | 273ft | 13/15+ kn | 4× 21" tubes (amidships) | Turbo-electric drive | 1 boat (Tullibee SSN-597)

**Innovation:** Turbo-electric drive (vs direct drive) for reduced noise. Bow-mounted sonar with amidships torpedo tubes. Slowest nuclear submarine but quietest.

**Service:** ASW platform 1960-1988. Proved concepts for later SSNs. Decommissioned 1988.
