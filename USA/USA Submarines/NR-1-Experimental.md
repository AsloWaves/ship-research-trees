**Experimental Research Submarine** - NR-1 was smallest nuclear submarine ever built. Deep submergence research and recovery vessel. Rolled on ocean floor with extendable wheels. 39 years of service, never formally commissioned. Unique nuclear-powered research submarine.

**Key Specs:** 400 tons | 145ft | 3.5 kn | 3,000ft depth | 11 crew | Nuclear reactor | No armament | EXPERIMENTAL

**Innovation:** Smallest nuclear submarine ever built. Could roll on ocean floor with extendable wheels. Deep submergence capability (3,000 feet). Manipulator arms for recovery operations. 30-day endurance underwater. Never received USS designation or formal commissioning.

**Unique Design Features:**
- **Size:** Only 145 feet long, 400 tons displacement
- **Propulsion:** Two ducted thrusters, not propellers
- **Mobility:** Four wheels extended from hull to roll on seafloor
- **Depth:** Operated to 3,000 feet (nearly half nautical mile)
- **Endurance:** 30 days submerged (limited by crew provisions)
- **Crew:** 5 officers, 2 scientists, 4 enlisted (11 total)

**Construction:**
- **Laid down:** June 10, 1967, Electric Boat, Groton, CT
- **Launched:** January 25, 1969
- **In service:** January 27, 1969 (never formally commissioned)
- **Cost:** $99 million (1969 dollars)
- **Reactor:** S5W nuclear reactor (same as Skipjack-class)
- **Designer:** Admiral Hyman G. Rickover concept

**Special Equipment:**
- **Manipulator arms:** Two extendable robotic arms for recovery
- **Wheels:** Four extendable wheels for seafloor mobility
- **View ports:** Three viewing ports for direct observation
- **Lighting:** External searchlights and cameras
- **Sonar:** Bottom-mapping sonar systems
- **Sensors:** Oceanographic and scientific instruments

**Notable Missions:**
- **1976:** Found and recovered lost missile from ocean floor
- **1986:** Identified and raised Space Shuttle Challenger debris
- **1995:** Investigated Air France Flight 447 crash site
- **2002:** Photographed and investigated USS Monitor (Civil War ironclad)
- **2005:** Surveyed World War II wrecks in Pacific
- **Classified missions:** Cable surveillance, ocean floor mapping

**Operational History (1969-2008):**
NR-1 operated continuously for 39 years on research, recovery, and classified missions. Rarely publicized, vessel performed deep ocean research and recovery operations worldwide. Transported on surface by modified mother ship (MTS-635) for long-distance transit.

**Capabilities:**
- **Deep dive:** 3,000 feet operational depth
- **Bottom time:** Unlimited (nuclear power)
- **Precision work:** Manipulator arms for delicate recovery
- **Observation:** Direct viewing and HD cameras
- **Mobility:** Could hover or roll on bottom
- **Navigation:** Precise positioning for scientific work

**Why NR-1 Was Unique:**
- Only nuclear-powered deep submergence vehicle
- Only submarine with wheels for seafloor mobility
- Smallest nuclear submarine ever built
- Never formally commissioned (placed in service)
- Operated by Navy but no "USS" designation
- Civilian scientists routinely embarked

**Comparison to DSVs:**
| Feature | NR-1 | Alvin (DSV-2) | Trieste |
|---------|------|---------------|---------|
| Power | Nuclear | Batteries | Batteries |
| Depth | 3,000 ft | 14,800 ft | 35,800 ft |
| Endurance | 30 days | 6-10 hours | Limited |
| Size | 400 tons | 17 tons | 50 tons |
| Crew | 11 | 3 | 2 |

**Decommissioning:**
- **November 21, 2008:** Deactivated at Groton, CT
- **Disposition:** Defueled and scrapped
- **Replacement:** None - unique capabilities not replicated
- **Legacy:** Proved value of nuclear power for deep research

**Impact:**
- **Deep ocean access:** Nuclear endurance enabled long missions
- **Recovery operations:** Demonstrated precision salvage capability
- **Oceanographic research:** Continuous bottom time for surveys
- **Military applications:** Classified cable and wreck surveillance
- **Technology demonstrator:** Small nuclear reactor reliability

**Modern Successors:**
No direct replacement for NR-1's capabilities. Current deep submergence vehicles (DSVs) use battery power with limited endurance. ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) have replaced some functions but lack nuclear endurance.

**Legacy:**
- Longest-serving research submarine (39 years)
- Proved feasibility of small nuclear submarines
- Pioneer of deep ocean recovery operations
- Contributed to space shuttle investigations
- Advanced oceanographic and military knowledge
