**First Fleet Submarines** - Barracuda-class (V-1 to V-3) were first large US fleet submarines. 2,000+ tons displacement, 12,000nm range for Pacific operations.

**Key Specs:** 2000/2620 tons | 341ft | 18/11kn | 6× 21" tubes, 16 torpedoes + 5" deck gun | 3 boats (Barracuda V-1, Bass V-2, Bonita V-3)

**Innovation:** First US "fleet submarines" designed for long-range Pacific operations. Massive increase in size/range over S-class. Influenced all future designs.

**Service:** Fleet exercises 1920s-1930s. All three served WWII in training roles. Decommissioned 1937-1945.
