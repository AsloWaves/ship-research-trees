**Largest Destroyer Class Ever** - 156 ships built, the largest destroyer class in US Navy history. Near-identical to Wickes but slightly improved.

**Game Changers:**
- üèÜ **Largest Class Ever** - 156 ships (record still stands)
- ‚ö° **Fastest Yet** - 35.5kn design speed, 27,600 hp
- üéØ **Gun Experiments** - DD-231-235 had 5-inch/51 cal guns
- üîß **Twin Mounts** - USS Hovey, USS Long had 8√ó 4-inch/50 in twin mounts

**vs [[Wickes-Class]]:** +36t | +0.2kn | +3,000 hp | Otherwise nearly identical

**Known Issue:** Some carried problematic Yarrow boilers that wore out quickly

**WWII Modifications (Extensive conversions):**
- **APD (High-speed transport):** 3√ó 3-inch/50 guns
- **DMS (Destroyer minesweeper):** 3√ó 3-inch/50 guns, torpedo tubes replaced by minesweeping gear
- **DM (Minelayer):** 3√ó 3-inch/50 guns
- **AVD (Seaplane tender):** 2√ó 3-inch/50 guns
- **Depth Charges:** 2 tracks aft, Y-gun projector
- **Boiler Reduction:** Similar to Wickes modifications

**Post-WWI Standardization (1921):** All destroyers fitted with 4-inch/50 cal Mark 9 Mod 5 guns

**Legacy:** Served in multiple navies (US, UK, USSR via Lend-Lease) through WWII and beyond
