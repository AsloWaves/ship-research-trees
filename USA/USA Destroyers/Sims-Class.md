**Advanced Fire Control** - First destroyer class with the revolutionary Mark 37 GFCS and automated fire control computer.

**Game Changers:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Mark 37 GFCS** - Advanced gun fire control system (revolutionary)
- ðŸ’» **Ford Mark 1 Computer** - Automated aiming computer
- ðŸ”§ **Double Reduction Gearing** - More efficient power transmission
- ðŸ”¥ **715Â°F Steam** - Hottest steam temperature yet

**vs [[Benham-Class]]:** Broke treaty limit (+70t) | **Advanced FCS** | +8 ft length | +1,900 shp | Fewer torpedoes (8 vs 16)

**Design Shift:** Emphasized fire control and guns over torpedo armament

**1942-1945 WWII Modifications:**
- 1942: 4Ã— 40mm Bofors (twin), 4Ã— 20mm Oerlikon (single)
