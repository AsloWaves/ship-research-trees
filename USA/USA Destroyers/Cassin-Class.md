**Thousand Tonner - Upgunned** - First 1000+ ton destroyers with 4-inch guns. Trade-off: larger caliber but slower speed.

**Game Changers:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **First 4-inch Guns** - Larger caliber (102mm vs 76mm)
- ðŸ“Š **1000+ Tons** - Displacement milestone
- ðŸ”§ **Twin-screw Return** - 2 shafts vs 3 (simpler, more efficient)
- ðŸš€ **8Ã— Torpedo Tubes** - Enhanced striking power

**vs [[Paulding-Class]]:** +280t | 3"â†’**4"** guns | -1 gun (4 vs 5) | +2 torpedo tubes | +4,000 shp | **-3.7kn speed**

**Design Trade-off:** Firepower vs Speed philosophy
âœ“ Larger gun caliber | Greater range | Heavier broadside
âœ— Slower (29.14 vs 32.8 knots) | Fewer guns (4 vs 5)

**WWI:** Depth charge racks for ASW convoy escort
