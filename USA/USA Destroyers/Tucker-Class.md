**Geared Turbine Pioneer** - USS Wadsworth was the first US destroyer with geared steam turbines, a technology that would become standard.

**Game Changers:**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **First Geared Turbines** - USS Wadsworth experimental (others direct-drive Curtis)
- üìè **Longer Hull** - 315 ft vs 305 ft (+10 ft)
- üéØ **Improved Guns** - 33-lb AP projectiles at 2,900 fps, 15,920 yard range

**vs [[O'Brien-Class]]:** +10t | +10 ft length | +500 shp | Curtis turbines | Yarrow boilers

**Notable:** USS Wadsworth's geared turbines proved superior efficiency, foreshadowing future designs

**WWI:** Depth charges added | AA guns requested but not fitted
