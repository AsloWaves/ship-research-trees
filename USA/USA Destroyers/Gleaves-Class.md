**Contemporary to Benson** - Near-identical to Benson-Class but with Westinghouse turbines and highest steam temperature.

**Game Changers:**
- üî• **850¬∞F Steam** - Highest temperature achieved on US destroyers
- üè≠ **Large Production** - 66 ships built
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Westinghouse Turbines** - vs Bethlehem on Benson

**vs [[Benson-Class]]:** +10t | Same armament | Westinghouse turbines | **850¬∞F steam** (vs 750¬∞F)

**Design Evolution:**
- As designed: 5√ó 5-inch/38, 10 torpedo tubes
- DD-453 onward: 4√ó 5-inch/38, 10 torpedo tubes (1 gun removed for AA)
- Later: 5 torpedo tubes (1√ó quint mount)

**WWII AA Upgrades:**
- DD-453 onward: 4√ó 40mm Bofors (2√ó2), 7√ó 20mm Oerlikon
- Late-war: Up to 12√ó 40mm (quad/twin), 4√ó 20mm

**Significance:** Established 850¬∞F as standard steam temperature for WWII destroyers
