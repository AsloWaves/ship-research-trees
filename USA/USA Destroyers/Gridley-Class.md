**Maximum Torpedoes & Speed** - Ultimate torpedo-focused treaty destroyer with record-breaking speed.

**Game Changers:**
- üöÄ **16 Torpedo Tubes** - 4√ó quad mounts (MAXIMUM ARMAMENT)
- ‚ö° **42.8 Knots** - USS Maury trials speed record
- üéØ **Curved Ahead Fire** - Advanced torpedo launch capability
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Gun Trade-off** - 4 guns vs 5 (weight for torpedoes)

**vs [[Mahan-Class]]:** -1 gun (4 vs 5) | +4 torpedo tubes (16 vs 12) | +1,000 shp | +5.8kn trials

**Design Philosophy:** Prioritized torpedo striking power over gun armament

**1943 WWII Modifications:**
- 7√ó 20mm Oerlikon
- **NO 40mm Bofors** - stability concerns prevented installation
- Depth charges: 4 K-gun throwers + 2 racks
- VT fuses (late 1942)

**Legacy:** Demonstrated the practical limits of torpedo armament on treaty destroyers
