**Stealth Multi-Mission** - Revolutionary stealth destroyer with tumblehome hull and integrated electric drive. Only 3 built due to cost.

**Game Changers:**
- üëª **Stealth Design** - Tumblehome hull, radar cross-section of fishing boat
- ‚ö° **Integrated Electric** - 78 MW electric plant, podded propulsion
- üéØ **155mm AGS** - Advanced Gun System (no ammunition procured)
- ü§ñ **Minimal Crew** - 147 vs 323 (Burke) - extensive automation
- üìè **Massive** - 15,995t full load (largest "destroyer")

**vs [[Arleigh Burke-Class]]:** +6,000t | +101 ft | **Stealth** | Electric drive | **1/2 crew**

**Armament (Current/Planned):**
- **Guns:** 2√ó 155mm AGS (inactive - no LRLAP ammo)
- **VLS:** 80√ó Mk 57 peripheral VLS
  - SM-2/3/6, Tomahawk
  - **Hypersonic:** CPS (Conventional Prompt Strike) being added
- **CIWS:** 2√ó 30mm Mk 46 guns

**Propulsion:** Integrated Power System (IPS)
- **Generators:** 2√ó Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines, 2√ó Rolls-Royce RR4500 turbines
- **Power:** 78 MW total electric generation
- **Drive:** Induction motors, podded propulsion
- **Advantages:** Electric power for future directed energy weapons

**Dual-Band Radar:**
- **AN/SPY-3** (X-band): Multi-function, horizon search
- **AN/SPY-4** (S-band): Volume search (removed post-construction for cost)

**Controversial Program:**
- **Original Plan:** 32 ships
- **Final Build:** 3 ships (DDG-1000, 1001, 1002)
- **Cost:** ~$4.4 billion per ship
- **Issues:** AGS ammo too expensive ($800k/round), program terminated
- **Future:** Being retrofitted for hypersonic missiles

**Legacy:** Technology demonstrator, influenced future designs, but production cancelled in favor of continued Arleigh Burke construction.
