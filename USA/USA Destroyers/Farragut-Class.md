**New Era - Treaty Destroyers** - First modern US destroyers built under Washington/London Treaty 1500-ton limit. Revolutionary 5-inch/38 dual-purpose guns.

**Game Changers:**
- 🎯 **5-inch/38 Guns** - First dual-purpose (anti-surface + anti-aircraft) guns
- 🔥 **Superheated Steam** - 400 psi @ 648°F with superheaters (first US destroyer)
- 🚀 **37 Knots** - High speed with 42,800 shp
- 🎚️ **Quad Torpedo Mounts** - 8× 21-inch in 2 centerline quad mounts

**vs [[Clemson-Class]]:** +310t | +1.5kn | +15,200 shp | 4"→**5"/38** guns | Modern fire control

**1943 WWII Modifications:**
- Midships gun removed for AA installation
- 4× 40mm Bofors (2×2)
- 5× 20mm Oerlikon
- Depth charges: 4 K-gun throwers + 2 stern racks
- SC radar added
- Radio proximity fuses (VT fuses, late 1942)

**Significance:** Established the template for all WWII-era US destroyers with dual-purpose 5-inch/38 guns
