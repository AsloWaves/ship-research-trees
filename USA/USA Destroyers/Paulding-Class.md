**MILESTONE CLASS - Oil Revolution** - First oil-fired US destroyers, largest class built to date (21 ships). Major logistics and operational improvements.

**Game Changers:**
- ‚õΩ **First Oil-fired** - End of coal era, easier refueling/handling
- üè≠ **Mass Production** - 21 ships (largest class yet)
- ‚ö° **Speed Demon** - 32.8kn trial speed (fastest yet)
- üöÄ **2√ó Torpedo Capacity** - 6 tubes vs 3 (twin mounts)

**vs [[Smith-Class]]:** +40t | Coal‚Üí**Oil** | +2,000 shp | +2.4kn | 6√ó torpedo tubes vs 3√ó

**Oil Advantages:** Pumped vs shoveled | No coal dust | Faster refueling | Better crew conditions | Greater range per ton

**WWI:** Depth charge tracks added for convoy escort
