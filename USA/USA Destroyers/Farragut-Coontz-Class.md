**First Missile Destroyers** - First US destroyers designed from the keel up for guided missiles. Originally classified as frigates (DLG).

**Game Changers:**
- ðŸš€ **Terrier SAM** - Mk 10 twin-arm launcher, 40-80 missile capacity
- ðŸŽ¯ **Dedicated Missile Design** - Purpose-built for area air defense
- ðŸ“¡ **Advanced Radars** - Integrated missile fire control
- âš“ **Large Hull** - 5,648t full load (2Ã— Gearing size)

**Original Designation:** DLG-6 to DLG-15 (Guided Missile Frigates)
**Reclassified 1975:** DDG-37 to DDG-46 (Guided Missile Destroyers)

**Armament:**
- **Gun:** 1Ã— 5-inch/54 Mark 42 (forward, 599 rounds)
- **SAM:** Mk 10 launcher with Terrier/Standard (40-80 missiles)
  - RIM-2 Terrier â†’ SM-1ER (RIM-67A) â†’ SM-2ER (RIM-67B)
- **ASW:** Mk 112 ASROC launcher (8 ready rounds)
- **Anti-Ship:** 8Ã— Harpoon (added later in 2Ã— quad launchers)
- **Torpedoes:** 6Ã— Mark 32 tubes (Mark 44/46/50)

**Propulsion:** 85,000 shp, 32 knots, 5,000 nm @ 20kn

**Significance:** Established template for Cold War missile destroyers - area air defense + ASW capability
