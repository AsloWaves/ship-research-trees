**Balanced Torpedo Design** - Maintained 16-tube armament with improved endurance and stability.

**vs [[Gridley-Class]]:** Same guns & torpedoes | +420 nm range | GE turbines w/cruising turbines | Lower boiler pressure (400 vs 565 psi)

**Key Improvement:** Cruising turbines fitted for better fuel economy and extended range

**1943 WWII Modifications:**
- 1× 40mm Bofors (twin)
- 6× 20mm Oerlikon
- 4 K-gun throwers (some vessels)
- SC radar
