**Contemporary to Cassin** - Nearly identical to Cassin-Class, but used Cramp turbines and White-Forster boilers. Same armament configuration.

**vs [[Cassin-Class]]:** +16t | Same guns & torpedoes | Different manufacturer (Cramp vs Parsons/Curtis turbines)

**Notable:** USS Benham temporarily fitted with 4× twin 4-inch mounts in 1917 (experimental)

**WWI:** Depth charge racks added
**By 1929:** 1× 3-inch/23 cal AA gun added (all except Parker)
