**Mass Production Era** - 111 ships built in massive WWI production effort. Standardized flush-deck design with high speed.

**Game Changers:**
- üè≠ **Mass Production** - 111 ships (unprecedented scale)
- ‚ö° **35+ Knots** - 35.3kn max speed, 24,610 shp
- üì¶ **Standardization** - Parsons geared turbines across the class
- üîÑ **Versatile Platform** - Widely converted to APD, DMS roles in WWII

**vs [[Caldwell-Class]]:** +134t | +3-5kn | +4,600 shp | Fully standardized geared turbines

**WWII Modifications:**
- **Boiler Reduction:** Nearly all had half their boilers removed (one or more stacks removed)
- **Torpedo Reduction:** Halved in DD config; removed entirely in conversions
- **Depth Charges:** Single track aft, Y-gun projectors added
- **Anti-Aircraft:** Dual-purpose 3-inch/50 cal guns added
- **APD Conversions:** 16 ships ‚Üí high-speed transports
- **DMS Conversions:** 8 ships ‚Üí destroyer minesweepers

**Famous Ships:** Many survived to serve in WWII after extensive modifications
