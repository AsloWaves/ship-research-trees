**MILESTONE CLASS** - Revolutionary leap introducing steam turbine propulsion and true ocean-going capability. 50% larger than predecessors.

**Game Changers:**
- âœ¨ **First US Turbine Destroyers** - Parsons direct-drive, triple-screw (3 shafts)
- ðŸ”š **Last Coal-fired** - End of coal era (304t capacity)
- ðŸŒŠ **First Ocean-going** - True blue-water capability
- ðŸ“ˆ **+60% Displacement** - 700t vs 420-433t predecessors

**v[[USA/USA Destroyers/Bainbridge-Class]]][[USA/USA Destroyers/Truxtun-Class]]]]:** +280t | 2.5Ã— firepower (5 vs 2 guns) | +20-40% power | Triple-screw turbines

**1916 Modification:** 5 guns â†’ 4 guns | Single torpedo tubes â†’ 2Ã— twin mounts
**WWI:** Depth charge racks added
