**First Flush-Decker** - Introduced the iconic flush-deck design that would define WWI destroyers. Mixed propulsion configurations across the class.

**Game Changers:**
- üö¢ **Flush-Deck Design** - Continuous main deck, no forecastle break
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Geared Turbines** - DD-69-71, 74 had Parsons geared turbines (32kn, 20,000 shp)
- üîß **Mixed Configs** - DD-72-73 had direct-drive turbines (30kn, 18,500 hp, 3 shafts)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Integrated AA** - 1√ó 3-inch/23 cal AA gun

**vs [[Sampson-Class]]:** Similar displacement | Flush-deck design | Geared turbines (some) | +2kn speed

**WWII Modifications:**
- Depth charge rack (single, aft)
- Y-gun projector (forward of aft deckhouse)
- **APD Conversion:** USS Manley ‚Üí APD-1 (1940) - carried 200 Marines & 4 Higgins boats
- **Lend-Lease:** 3 ships transferred to Royal Navy (1940)
