**Experimental Destroyer Leader** - Single experimental ship testing "destroyer leader" concept. Large ASW-focused platform between destroyers and cruisers.

**Game Changers:**
- üìè **5,600 Tons** - Huge for 1950s "destroyer" (cruiser-sized)
- üéØ **8√ó 3-inch Guns** - Many light guns vs fewer heavy guns
- üî• **1200 psi Steam** - High-pressure steam plant
- üöÄ **Weapon Alpha** - 4√ó RUR-4 ASW rocket launchers
- ‚ö° **80,000 shp** - Very powerful for the era

**vs [[Gearing-Class]]:** +2,984t | +150 ft | 3"‚Üí8√ó **3" guns** | ASW-focused

**Original Configuration (1953):**
- 8√ó 3-inch/50 cal guns
- 16√ó 20mm AA guns
- 8√ó 21-inch torpedo tubes
- 4√ó Weapon Alpha (RUR-4) ASW rocket launchers (Mark 108)

**1960 Modernization:**
- **Upgraded:** 8√ó 3-inch/70 cal guns (from 3"/50)
- **Removed:** 16√ó 20mm guns
- **Added:** 1√ó ASROC octuple launcher (Mark 112)
- **Retained:** 4√ó Weapon Alpha

**Propulsion:** 80,000 shp, 32 knots, 6,000 nm @ 20kn

**"Destroyer Leader" Concept:**
- Intended to lead destroyer squadrons
- More capable radar and communications
- Enhanced ASW capability
- Bridge between destroyers and cruisers

**Legacy:** Experimental class - concept not widely adopted. Led to development of later DL/DLG classes.
