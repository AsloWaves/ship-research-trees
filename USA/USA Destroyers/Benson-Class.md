**WWII Workhorse** - First true WWII destroyer class with centerline quintuple torpedo mounts and enhanced AA capability.

**Game Changers:**
- üéØ **Quintuple Torpedo Mounts** - 2√ó 5-tube centerline mounts (10 total)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Heavy AA Focus** - Designed for AA warfare from the start
- ‚öôÔ∏è **4 Boilers Return** - Back to 4-boiler design (vs 3)
- üì° **Early Radar** - SC radar (early installation)

**vs [[Sims-Class]]:** +50t | +2 torpedo tubes (10 vs 8) | **Quintuple mounts** | +4 boilers (4 vs 3)

**Wartime Adaptations:**
- Early ships: 5√ó 5-inch/38 guns
- DD-459 onward: 4√ó 5-inch/38 (1 removed for AA)
- Mid-1942: 40mm Bofors (twin), 7√ó 20mm Oerlikon
