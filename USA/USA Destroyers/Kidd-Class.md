**"Ayatollah-Class"** - Four AAW-enhanced Spruance-class destroyers originally built for Iran. Kept by US Navy after Iranian Revolution. Most heavily armed conventionally-powered US destroyers.

**Game Changers:**
- üöÄ **2√ó Mk 26 Launchers** - 68 total missiles (vs VLS on Spruance)
- üéØ **Dedicated AAW** - Area air defense capability
- üõ°Ô∏è **2√ó Phalanx CIWS** - Point defense
- üì° **Enhanced Radars** - Better air search than base Spruance
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Environmental Systems** - Air conditioning for Persian Gulf ops

**vs [[Spruance-Class]]:** +100t | Same hull | **AAW-focused** | Mk 26 vs VLS | Better air defense

**Background:**
- **Originally:** Ordered by Imperial Iranian Navy (1974)
- **Iranian Revolution (1979):** Construction halted
- **US Navy Purchase:** Acquired and commissioned (1981-1982)
- **Nickname:** "Ayatollah-class" or "dead admiral class"

**Armament:**
- **Guns:** 2√ó 5-inch/54 Mark 45 (1 fwd, 1 aft)
- **Missiles:**
  - 2√ó Mk 26 twin-arm launchers (52 + 16 = 68 missiles)
  - SM-1MR Standard SAM (primary)
  - ASROC anti-submarine missiles
  - 8√ó Harpoon anti-ship (2√ó quad launchers)
- **CIWS:** 2√ó Phalanx 20mm (later ships)
- **Torpedoes:** 6√ó Mark 32 tubes (Mk 46/50)
- **Helicopter:** 2√ó SH-60B Seahawk (LAMPS III)

**Sensors:**
- **Radar:**
  - AN/SPS-48E 3D air search
  - AN/SPS-55 surface search
  - 2√ó SPG-51D fire control (for Standard missiles)
- **Sonar:** AN/SQS-53A bow-mounted
- **EW:** SLQ-32(V)3 electronic warfare suite

**Propulsion:** Same as Spruance
- 4√ó GE LM2500 gas turbines (80,000 shp)
- 30+ knots, 6,000 nm @ 20kn

**Advantages over Base Spruance:**
- ‚úì Area air defense capability (SM-1MR)
- ‚úì Faster reaction time (Mk 26 vs early VLS)
- ‚úì Enhanced radar suite
- ‚úì More robust CIWS
- ‚úì Environmental control for hot climates

**Service:**
- Excellent air defense platforms
- Operated in Persian Gulf extensively
- Decommissioned 1998-1999 (shorter service than Spruance)
- **Transferred to Taiwan (2005-2006):** All 4 ships sold to Republic of China Navy
  - Renamed: Kee Lung, Su Ao, Tso Ying, Ma Kong
  - Still active in Taiwanese service

**Legacy:** Proved gas turbine reliability and effectiveness. Most capable AAW destroyers until Arleigh Burke-class.
