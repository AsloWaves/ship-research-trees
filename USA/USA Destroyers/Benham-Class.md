**High-Pressure Innovation** - First to use 3 high-pressure boilers instead of 4, reducing weight and complexity.

**Game Changers:**
- üî• **600 psi Boilers** - Highest pressure yet (reduced from 4)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **3 Boilers** - Weight/space savings from reduced count
- ‚ö° **49,250 shp** - More power from fewer boilers
- üéØ **Curved Ahead Fire** - Mark 15 torpedoes

**vs [[Bagley-Class]]:** -1 boiler (3 vs 4) | +2,000 shp | +135 psi | -550 nm range

**Design Philosophy:** High-pressure boilers allowed fewer boilers while maintaining/exceeding power

**1942-45 WWII Modifications:**
- Early: 6√ó 20mm Oerlikon
- Late: 4√ó 40mm Bofors (twin), 4√ó 20mm (twin)
- **Some ships:** All torpedo tubes removed by 1945 for additional AA
- SC radar, VT fuses (late 1942)
