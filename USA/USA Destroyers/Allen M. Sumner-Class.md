**Twin Gun Mounts** - Revolutionary design with 3 twin 5-inch mounts, increasing firepower by 20% over Fletcher.

**Game Changers:**
- üéØ **6√ó 5-inch Guns** - 3√ó twin Mark 38 mounts (2 fwd, 1 aft)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Heavy AA** - 12√ó 40mm Bofors (2√ó4 quad + 2√ó2 twin), 11√ó 20mm
- üìà **+20% Firepower** - 6 guns vs 5 (Fletcher)
- üîß **Twin Mounts** - More firepower, fewer crew per gun

**vs [[Fletcher-Class]]:** +150t | Same length | **Twin gun mounts** | +1 gun (6 vs 5) | +1-5√ó 40mm AA

**Main Battery:** 6√ó 5-inch/38 Mark 12 in 3√ó Mark 38 twin mounts
- Configuration: 2 forward, 1 aft (numbered 51, 52, 53)
- Same performance as Fletcher single mounts

**Late 1945 Modification:** Many ships had aft quintuple torpedo mount removed, replaced with additional 40mm quad mount (16√ó 40mm total)

**FRAM II Modifications (1960s):**
- 2√ó triple Mark 32 ASW torpedo tubes (12.75-inch Mark 44 homing torpedoes)
- SPS-10 surface search radar
- Variable Depth Sonar (VDS)
- DASH ASW drone helicopter with landing pad
- **All 6√ó 5-inch guns retained** (unlike Gearing FRAM I)
- **NO ASROC** fitted

**Legacy:** Many served through WWII and Korean War, then modernized with FRAM II for ASW role in 1960s
