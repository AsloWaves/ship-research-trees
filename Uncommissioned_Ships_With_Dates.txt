UNCOMMISSIONED SHIPS WITH ERA DATES
=====================================

Extracted from ship files where commissioned: Never/None/N/A/Cancelled

NOTE: This is an INCOMPLETE extraction. Due to the large volume of German ships (50 total),
only USA (9), Great-Britain (6), Japan (5), and German Carriers (15) have been processed.
Remaining German battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines still need to be extracted.
