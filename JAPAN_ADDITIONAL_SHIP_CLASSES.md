## SUMMARY

**Current count: 115 ship files**

**Potential additions:**
- **Pre-WWI:** ~20 classes
- **Interwar:** ~30 classes
- **WWII additions:** ~15 classes
- **Post-WWII early:** ~25 classes
- **Modern additions:** ~5 classes
- **Cancelled/unique:** ~10 classes

**Total potential: ~105 additional classes**

**Grand total possible: ~220 ship classes covering 1886-2025**

This would create one of the most comprehensive Japanese naval databases available!
