# JAPAN SUBMARINES RESEARCH TREE LOGIC

**Node Range**: 4800-4841 (42 nodes)
**Nation**: Japanese
**Ship Type**: Submarines (SS)

## Overview

Japanese submarine development represents one of the most innovative and ambitious submarine programs in naval history. The Imperial Japanese Navy pioneered **submarine aircraft carriers**, developed the **fastest WWII submarines** (I-201 class, 19 knots submerged), created the **largest submarines until the nuclear age** (I-400 class), and deployed the **most advanced torpedoes** (Type 95 oxygen torpedoes—fastest submarine torpedoes of WWII).

**Key Innovations**:
- **I-400 Class**: 122m long, 5,900 tons, carried **3 Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft**—largest submarines until 1965
- **I-201 Class**: **19 knots submerged** (fastest WWII submarine by 5+ knots)
- **Type 95 Oxygen Torpedo**: 49-51 knots, 9-12 km range—**fastest torpedo in common use**
- **Cruiser Submarines**: Long-range fleet submarines with seaplanes for reconnaissance
- **Midget Submarines**: Ko-Hyoteki class used at Pearl Harbor

## Historical Context

### I-400 Class: The Submarine Aircraft Carrier
The I-400 class represents one of the most ambitious submarine designs in history:
- **Size**: 122m long, 5,900 tons—**largest submarines until nuclear age (1965)**
- **Aircraft**: **3× Aichi M6A Seiran** bomber floatplanes in watertight hangar
- **Range**: Could **circumnavigate the world 1.5 times** without refueling
- **Launch Time**: Could prepare, fuel, arm, and launch all 3 aircraft in **45 minutes**
- **Mission**: Designed by Admiral Yamamoto to strike **Panama Canal and US mainland**
- **Reality**: Only 3 completed (18 planned), mission cancelled at surrender
- **Post-War**: Captured by USS Blue, studied by US Navy, sank as target 1946

### I-201 Class: The Fastest Submarine
The I-201 class was revolutionary in speed:
- **Submerged Speed**: **19 knots**—fastest WWII submarine (5+ knots faster than any Allied submarine)
- **Streamlined Design**: Reduced drag with streamlined hull
- **High-Capacity Batteries**: Advanced electric propulsion
- **Limited Production**: Only 3 completed before war ended
- **Impact**: Influenced post-war Soviet, British, and US submarine designs

### Type 95 Oxygen Torpedo
The **fastest submarine torpedo in common use during WWII**:
- **Speed**: 49-51 knots (3× faster than many Allied torpedoes)
- **Range**: 9-12 km (about **3× the range** of US Navy Mark 14)
- **Warhead**: 405-550 kg—**largest submarine torpedo warhead** of its time
- **Propulsion**: Kerosene-oxygen wet-heater engine
- **Advantage**: Pure oxygen left **no visible wake** for detection
- **Recognition**: Capabilities went **mostly unrecognized by Allies until 1943**

### Submarine Warfare Doctrine
Unlike Germany's U-boats focusing on merchant shipping:
- **Fleet Warfare**: Designed to support fleet actions against US Navy
- **Scout Role**: Aircraft-carrying submarines for reconnaissance
- **Commerce Raiding**: Secondary role, less emphasized than Germany
- **Results**: Sank ≈1 million tons merchant shipping (vs. Germany's 14+ million tons)
- **Achievements**: Notable successes against US warships (carriers Wasp, Yorktown)

## Summary

The Japanese submarine research tree showcases one of the most innovative submarine programs in naval history. From the massive I-400 class submarine aircraft carriers (largest until nuclear age) to the revolutionary I-201 high-speed submarines (fastest WWII submarine at 19 knots submerged) to the deadly Type 95 oxygen torpedoes (fastest submarine torpedoes in common use), Japan pioneered multiple submarine technologies that influenced post-war designs worldwide.

The tree offers 42 nodes covering 1905-1970, providing multiple paths through:
- **Fleet Submarines**: Kaidai types (backbone of the force)
- **Cruiser Submarines**: Junsen types with aircraft
- **Aircraft Carriers**: I-400 class (only operational submarine aircraft carriers in history)
- **High-Speed**: I-201 class (revolutionary speed performance)
- **Medium**: RO-class patrol submarines
- **Midget**: Ko-Hyoteki (Pearl Harbor attack) and Kairyū
- **Post-War**: JMSDF modern submarines

**Total**: 42 nodes with 3 FREE starting ships.
