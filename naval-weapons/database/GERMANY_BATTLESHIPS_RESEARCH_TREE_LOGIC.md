## Overview

German battleship development from pre-dreadnoughts through WWI High Seas Fleet to WWII Kriegsmarine and massive H-class paper designs. Germany built powerful, well-armored battleships emphasizing survivability, with unique features like hexagonal turret layouts (Nassau), diesel propulsion (Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe), and eventually the largest battleship designs ever conceived (H-44: 131,000 tons).

**Key Innovations**:
- **First German Dreadnought** (1909): SMS Nassau - unique hexagonal turret layout with 12×28cm guns
- **Panzerschiffe** (1931-1936): Deutschland class - "pocket battleships," diesel-powered, 11" guns, commerce raiding
- **Fast Battleships** (1939): Scharnhorst class - 32 kts, 9×28cm guns
- **Bismarck Class** (1940-1941): Largest completed German battleships, 8×38cm guns, sank HMS Hood
- **H-Class Designs** (1939-1944): Escalating designs from H-39 (56,000 tons) to H-44 (131,000 tons, 8×50.8cm guns)

**Total Nodes**: 40 battleships spanning 1893-1944 (paper designs)

## Branch Descriptions

### 1. Starting (2 nodes)
FREE starting battleships. SMS Brandenburg (1893) was Germany's first ocean-going battleship. SMS Kaiser Friedrich III (1898-1902) represented the "hail of fire" doctrine with rapid-fire guns. Both provide tutorial introduction to German naval development.

### 2. Pre-Dreadnought Main (9 nodes)
Evolution from Wittelsbach (1902) through Deutschland class (1906-1908). The Deutschland class produced 5 ships including SMS Schleswig-Holstein (fired first shots of WWII at Danzig) and SMS Schlesien (survived until 1945). Thick armor and 28cm guns characterized late German pre-dreadnoughts.

### 3. Early Dreadnoughts (4 nodes)
SMS Nassau (1909) was Germany's first dreadnought with unique hexagonal turret layout for maximum broadside. Helgoland class improved with 30.5cm guns. SMS Ostfriesland (1911) was famously sunk in Billy Mitchell's 1921 bombing tests, demonstrating air power's threat to battleships.

### 4. Super-Dreadnoughts (5 nodes)
Kaiser class (1912-1913) introduced steam turbines and superfiring turrets. König class improved broadside fire. SMS Bayern (1916-1917) was the pinnacle of WWI German battleship design with 8×38cm guns, the most powerful armament of any WWI battleship.

### 5. Panzerschiffe (3 nodes)
Deutschland class "pocket battleships" (1931-1936) exploited Treaty of Versailles loopholes. Diesel-powered with 11" guns and 28-knot speed, designed for commerce raiding. Admiral Scheer was most successful, sinking 17 merchant ships. Admiral Graf Spee scuttled after Battle of River Plate (1939).

### 6. Fast Battleships (2 nodes)
Scharnhorst class (1939-1940) were fast battleships (32 kts) with 9×28cm guns. Designed for commerce raiding, they sank HMS Glorious (aircraft carrier) and executed the famous Channel Dash (1942). Scharnhorst sank in Battle of North Cape (1943).

### 7. Ultimate (2 nodes)
Bismarck class (1940-1941) were Germany's largest completed battleships at 50,000 tons with 8×38cm guns. Bismarck sank HMS Hood (Britain's pride) in 1941 but was hunted down and destroyed. Tirpitz spent most of WWII as "fleet in being" in Norway, tying down Allied resources until sunk by Tallboy bombs (1944).

### 8. Modernization (3 nodes)
Refits including SMS Bayern postwar improvements, Deutschland renamed Lützow (1940), and Scharnhorst's planned 38cm gun upgrade (never completed). Extends service life and capabilities.

### 9. H-Class Small (2 nodes)
H-39 design (56,444 tons, 8×40.6cm guns) was part of Plan Z with 6 ships planned. Two ships ("H" and "J") laid down in 1939 but cancelled when WWII started. H-41 (68,800 tons, 8×42cm guns) design finalized 1941 but never built.

### 10. H-Class Medium (2 nodes)
H-42 (90,000 tons, 8×48cm guns) and H-43 (111,000 tons, 8×50.8cm guns) were study projects exploring battleship limits. Purely theoretical, no construction planned. Increasingly unrealistic as war progressed.

### 11. H-Class Ultimate (2 nodes)
H-44 (131,000 tons, 8×50.8cm guns) represents the largest battleship design ever conceived by any nation. H-45 "Monster" (150,000+ tons) went beyond even H-44 as ultimate theoretical study. Both have severe reliability penalties (-15% to -20%) and are gameplay challenges.

### 12. Alternative (Battlecruiser) (4 nodes)
SMS Derfflinger and SMS Hindenburg were WWI battlecruisers combining speed with heavy guns (8×30.5cm). O-class and P-class were Plan Z battlecruisers designed for commerce raiding with 6×38cm guns and diesel engines (P-class). All cancelled by WWII.
