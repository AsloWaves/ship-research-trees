## Overview

USA torpedo development represents the evolution from early steam-powered weapons to sophisticated wire-guided homing systems. Key developments include:
- **Early Era**: Licensed Whitehead designs, experimental Howell flywheel torpedo
- **WWI-Interwar**: Mark series standardization, air-launched torpedo development
- **WWII**: Mark 14 controversy (detonator problems), electric wakeless torpedoes
- **Cold War**: Acoustic homing, ASW specialization, lightweight air-dropped
- **Modern**: Wire-guided heavyweight (Mark 48), world's most advanced torpedo

**Historical Significance**:
- Mark 14 detonator failures nearly cost Pacific War (1942-1943)
- Mark 13 aerial torpedo (Pearl Harbor countermeasure, Pacific War workhorse)
- Mark 48: Gold standard heavyweight torpedo (1972-present, continuous upgrades)

## Research Tree Structure

### Tier Progression
- **Tier 1-2**: Early torpedoes (1890-1910) - Experimental, low reliability
- **Tier 3-5**: WWI-Interwar (1910-1940) - Standardization, Mark series begins
- **Tier 6-8**: WWII (1940-1945) - Mass production, detonator crisis, electric torpedoes
- **Tier 9-10**: Post-WWII/Modern (1945-1990) - Acoustic homing, wire guidance, ASW

### Cost Scaling
- Tier 1-2: $50,000-$200,000 (early development)
- Tier 3-5: $200,000-$800,000 (WWI-Interwar refinement)
- Tier 6-8: $800,000-$3,000,000 (WWII mass production)
- Tier 9-10: $3,000,000-$15,000,000 (modern guided systems)

### WWII Crisis: Mark 14 Problems (1942-1943)

**Historical Context**: Mark 14 torpedo had THREE major defects that plagued early Pacific War:
1. **Depth control failure**: Ran 10 feet deeper than set (missed targets)
2. **Magnetic exploder failure**: Detonated prematurely or not at all
3. **Contact exploder failure**: Hit perpendicular but failed to detonate

These problems weren't fully resolved until late 1943, costing numerous attack opportunities.

## Legendary & Iconic Torpedoes

### Mark 14 - "The Torpedo That Nearly Lost the War"
**Historical Impact**: Entered service 1931 with THREE major defects that plagued 1942-1943 Pacific submarine operations. Depth control ran 10 feet too deep, magnetic exploder detonated prematurely or not at all, contact exploder failed on perpendicular hits. Problems not fully resolved until late 1943, costing critical attack opportunities against Japanese shipping.

**Game Representation**: Players must research through THREE separate mods (1014, 1015, 1016) to unlock fully functional Mark 14. Each mod costs research time/resources but dramatically improves hit rate.

### Mark 13 - "The Avenger's Weapon"
**Historical Impact**: Primary aerial torpedo of Pacific War. Initially plagued by unreliability (broke apart on water impact), fixed by 1944 with drag ring and pickle barrel stabilization fins. Delivered by TBF/TBM Avengers, SBD Dauntlesses (modified), and PBY Catalinas. Sank hundreds of Japanese ships 1943-1945.

**Game Representation**: Evolution from Mark 13 Early (unreliable, 1938) → Mod 1 (1942, drag ring) → Mod 2 (1944, final version). Critical for carrier aviation gameplay.

### Mark 48 ADCAP - "Gold Standard Heavyweight"
**Historical Impact**: World's most advanced heavyweight torpedo (1972-present). Wire-guided with active/passive sonar, can engage surface ships and submarines. ADCAP (Advanced Capability) upgrade in 1985 added digital guidance, improved countermeasures, under-ice capability. Continuously upgraded through Mod 6, 7, 8+ variants into 2020s.

**Game Representation**: Tier 10 ultimate submarine weapon. Expensive but devastating. Mark 48 ADCAP Mod 6 (1990) represents culmination of Cold War torpedo technology.

### Mark 24 "Fido" - "Silent Hunter"
**Historical Impact**: First operational acoustic homing torpedo (1943). Air-dropped from patrol aircraft, used passive sonar to home on submarine propeller noise. Credited with 37 confirmed U-boat kills 1943-1945 (68 total ASW kills). Code-named "Fido" to conceal acoustic homing capability from Germans.

**Game Representation**: Enables air ASW gameplay. Slow (12 kts) but deadly against submarines. Revolutionary Tier 9 technology.

## Research Cost & Time Balance

**Tier-Based Scaling**:
- **Tier 1-2** (1890-1910): Low cost ($0-$200K), short time (0-45 days) - experimental era
- **Tier 3-5** (1910-1940): Medium cost ($120K-$800K), medium time (60-150 days) - standardization
- **Tier 6-8** (1940-1945): High cost ($800K-$3M), long time (60-240 days) - WWII mass production, rapid iteration
- **Tier 9** (1945-1975): Very high cost ($2M-$6M), extended time (210-420 days) - Cold War development
- **Tier 10** (1975-1990): Extreme cost ($3.5M-$15M), maximum time (300-720 days) - modern guided systems

**Special Considerations**:
- Mark 14 fixes (1014-1016): Faster research time (60-90 days) representing urgent wartime fixes
- Training torpedoes: Lower cost, shorter time (useful for research tree filler)
- Nuclear variants (1029, 1033, 1054): Very high cost (nuclear program overhead)
- Experimental/cancelled (1050-1054): High research cost, no ongoing build cost (R&D programs)
