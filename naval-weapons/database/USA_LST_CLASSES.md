### Revolutionary Landing System
```yaml
Bow Ramp System:
  Ramp Weight: 34 long tons (35 metric tons)
  Ramp Length: 112 feet (34 meters)
  Ramp Material: Aluminum
  Capacity: Sustains loads up to 75 long tons (76 metric tons)

  Support Structure:

  Advantages Over Traditional Design:
    - Eliminates traditional bow doors
    - Allows higher speeds (no drag from bow doors)
    - More flexibility in landing operations
    - Can reach higher beaches
    - Reduced beaching time

Stern Gate:
  Purpose: Unload amphibious vehicles into water
  Alternative Uses:
    - Unload onto LCU (Landing Craft, Utility)
    - Unload onto pier
    - Improved operational flexibility

  Helicopter Deck:
    - Mounted atop stern gate
    - Can operate helicopters
    - Enhanced vertical assault capability

Hull Design:
  Type: Destroyer-type bow
  Features:
    - Sharp bow instead of blunt LST bow
    - Much higher speed capability
    - Better seakeeping
    - Reduced beaching capability (trade-off)

  Bottom:
    - Not traditional flat bottom
    - More conventional hull form
    - Optimized for speed over beaching
```

     - Changed LST operational concept

  3. Stern Gate Innovation:
     - Launch amphibious vehicles from stern
     - Helicopter operations capability
     - Pier/LCU unloading flexibility

  4. Size Increase:
     - 522 feet vs. 445 feet (De Soto County)
     - 8,550 tons vs. 7,823 tons full load
     - Largest LST design ever built

  5. Modern Systems:
     - Advanced navigation electronics
     - Improved communications
     - Better crew habitability

## LST Naming Convention

### World War II Era (1942-1955)
```yaml
Designation: Hull number only (e.g., USS LST-1, USS LST-542)
Practice: Ships identified by hull number
Reason: Rapid wartime production, temporary designation expected
```

### Post-1955 Era
```yaml
Change Date: July 1, 1955
New Practice: County or parish names assigned
Format: USS [County Name] (LST-####)

Examples:
  - USS LST-542 → USS Chelan County (LST-542)
  - USS LST-1156 → USS Terrebonne Parish (LST-1156)
  - USS LST-1171 → USS De Soto County (LST-1171)
  - USS LST-1179 → USS Newport (LST-1179)

Scope: Applied to LSTs remaining in service
Purpose: Formalize naming for peacetime navy
```
