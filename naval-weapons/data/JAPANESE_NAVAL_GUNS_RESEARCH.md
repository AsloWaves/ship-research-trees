## Japanese Gun Naming System

Japanese naval guns use a unique designation system based on the **Imperial Year** (counting from Emperor Meiji's ascension in 1868):

- **Type XX** or **XX Year Type** = Year 1868 + XX
  - Example: **Type 94** = 1868 + 94 = **1932**
  - Example: **3rd Year Type** = 1868 + 3 = **1871**
  - Example: **41st Year Type** = 1868 + 41 = **1909**

**Common Designations**:
- **Type 3** (3rd Year) = 1871
- **Type 10** (10th Year) = 1878
- **Type 11** (11th Year) = 1879
- **Type 41** (41st Year) = 1909
- **Type 88** = 1988 (rare, late-war)
- **Type 89** = 1929
- **Type 94** = 1932

## Additional Historical Guns to Research

To reach 23-25 historical guns, need to add:

1. **8cm/40 Type 88** - Earlier AA gun
2. **7.6cm** - WWI destroyer gun
3. **4.7cm** - Light AA gun
4. **40mm** - Light AA (if used)
5. **12cm/45 3rd Year Type** - Variant
6. **12cm/45 11th Year Type** - Another variant
7. **15cm/45** - Earlier light cruiser gun

## Notable Japanese Gun Characteristics

1. **High Muzzle Velocity**: Japanese guns prioritized velocity over shell weight
   - 20.3cm/50: 850 m/s (vs German 20.3cm: 925 m/s, but Japanese still fast)
   - 15.5cm/60: 925 m/s (very high for 6" gun)

2. **Type Designation System**: Based on imperial year system

3. **Treaty Compliance**: Initially complied with Washington Treaty limits
   - Mogami-class: Built with 15.5cm guns (treaty legal), later replaced with 20.3cm
   - Yamato: Built in secret after treaties expired

4. **Long Lance Torpedoes**: Japan's torpedo technology was world-leading, often more emphasized than guns on destroyers

5. **AA Deficiency**: Japanese AA guns generally inferior to US/British
   - 25mm Type 96: Magazine fed, slower than US 40mm Bofors (belt-fed)
   - 12.7cm Type 89: Good but not as effective as US 5"/38

6. **Quality vs Quantity**: Fewer ships, but individual ships very powerful
