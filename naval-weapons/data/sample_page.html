								<p>More powerful than the <a href="WNUS_16-45_mk6.php">16"/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 6 guns</a> 
								used on the North Carolina (BB-55) and South Dakota (BB-57) classes, this was possibly 
								the best battleship gun ever put into service. Originally intended to fire the relatively
								light 2,240 pound (1,016.0 kg) AP Mark 5 projectile, the shell handling
								system for these guns was redesigned to use the "super-heavy" 2,700 pound
								(1,224.7 kg) AP Mark 8 before any of the USS Iowa class (BB-61) battleships
								were laid down. This heavier projectile made these guns nearly the
								equal in terms of penetration power to the <a href="WNJAP_18-45_t94.php">46
								cm (18.1") guns</a> of the Japanese <i>Yamato</i> class battleships, yet they
								weighed less than three-quarters as much.
								<p>As modernized in the 1980s, each turret
								carried a DR-810 radar that measured the muzzle velocity of each gun, which
								made it easier to predict the velocity of succeeding shots. Together
								with the Mark 160 FCS and better propellant consistency, these improvements
								made these weapons into the most accurate battleship-caliber guns ever
								made. For example, during test shoots off Crete in 1987, fifteen
								shells were fired from 34,000 yards (31,900 m), five from the right gun
								of each turret. The pattern size was 220 yards (200 m), 0.64% of
								the total range. 14 out of the 15 landed within 250 yards (230 m)
								of the center of the pattern and 8 were within 150 yards (140 m).
								Shell-to-shell dispersion was 123 yards (112 m), 0.36% of total range.
								<p>The Armor Piercing (AP) shell fired
								by these guns is capable of penetrating nearly 30 feet (9 m) of concrete,
								depending upon the range and obliquity of impact. The High Capacity
								(HC) shell can create a crater 50 feet wide and 20 feet deep (15 x 6 m).
								During her deployment off Vietnam, USS New Jersey (BB-62) occasionally
								fired a single HC round into the jungle and so created a helicopter landing
								zone 200 yards (180 m) in diameter and defoliated trees for 300 yards (270
								m) beyond that.
								<p>A persistent anecdote is that the Iowa
								class suffered from alignment problems until after the Battle of Leyte
								Gulf. William Jurens, a noted expert on US naval weaponry, together
								with Iowa crewmembers and the staff at NSWC Dahlgren, performed a search
								of the official records for detailed data on this specific problem, but
								could find nothing in the files suggesting that the alignments were in
								any way out of the ordinary. Mr. Jurens' suspicion is that there
								may have been an oblique reference to an alignment problem in some document
								that was taken out of context; perhaps they were waiting for parts.
								<p>The Iowa class battleships were the last survivors of the battleship era to 
								be placed into service, but they now exist mainly as memorials. The big-gun 
								battleship era ended on 16 May 1991, when USS Wisconsin (BB-64) emptied her 
								barrels for the last time.
								<p>The weapon is constructed of liner, A tube, jacket, three hoops, two locking 
								rings, tube and liner locking ring, yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components 
								were autofretted. As typical of USN weapons built in the 1940s, the bore was 
								chromium plated for longer barrel life. Uses a Smith-Asbury Welin breech block 
								which opens downwards. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with 
								stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each. A manually 
								operated lever is used to rotate and unlock the breech plug, which is then pulled 
								opened manually. After loading, the breech plug is swung back up into the breech 
								by a pneumatic system. The manually operated lever is then used to rotate and lock 
								the breech closed. When the plug is locked, the breech lever engages the salvo latch 
								mechanism which prevents the breech from being opened again until after the gun fires.

											projectile was originally designed as the longer, heavier "big brother"
											to the AP Mark 5 projectiles used for the <a href="WNUS_16-45_mk5.php">16"/45
											(40.6 cm) guns</a> carried by the Colorado (BB-45) class battleships.
											Like the Mark 5, the Mark 8 projectiles were designed to be used in long-range
											gun actions against Japanese ships ("Plan Orange") and for that reason
											they were to be fired at relatively low muzzle velocities and high gun
											elevations. These conditions would result in a steeper angle of fall
											in order to enhance their deck armor penetration capabilities. In
											almost all respects the 1939 design of the Mark 8 Mod 0 was very similar
											to the Mark 5 except for length. However, around the end of 1944
											the improved Mark 8 Mod 6 version came out with significantly better hardening
											techniques which gave a noticeable improvement in penetration at impact
											angles of 35 degrees or so against thick face-hardened armor. This
											performance was so much better that BuOrd put out a memo stating that battleships
											were to return all previous Mods of this projectile as quickly as the Mod
											6 became available for loading aboard ship. The Mod 6 had an even
											blunter, rounded AP body nose (with no point) to further enhance penetration
											against deck armor at high obliquity. The Mod 8 had a heavier cap,
											blunter nose and harder body from improved heat treating techniques.
											The AP Mark 8 has a radius of ogive of 144 inches (366 cm) or 9crh and
											leaves the barrel rotating at about 70 RPS. This round creates
											overpressures exceeding 50 psi (3.5 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) close to the muzzle
											and 7 psi (0.5 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) at a distance of 50 feet (15 m) from
											the muzzle. The Mark 21 Base Detonating Fuze (BDF) had a delay of
											0.033 seconds. Fuze activation required a resistance equal to 1.5
											inches (3.8 cm) of armor at 0 degrees obliquity or 0.375 inches (1 cm)
											at 65 degrees obliquity. AP projectile bodies are painted black.
											The nose color indicates burster type, with yellow denoting Explosive D.
											A narrow colored band below the nose indicates the splash color. Used 
											Mark 21 Mods 0-3 Base Fuzes. AP Mark 8 Mods 6-8 were redesignated as Mark 139 
											Mod 0 in the 1980s. Earlier Mods were no longer in service and were not 
											redesignated.</div></div></li><li data-id="2a" class="noteitem" id="ammonote2"><div><span class="notecaret"><a href="#ammonote2.1back">^</a></span><div class="notetext">The AP Mark 8 had a nominal 1.5 lbs.

											HC Mark 13 was originally designed for the Colorado (BB-45) class battleships, 
											whose shell handling system limited the maximum projectile length to about 4 
											calibers. For standardization purposes, the Mark 13 was also issued to all of 
											the newer battleships, even though their shell handling systems could accommodate 
											a longer, heavier projectile. This much-needed projectile was introduced in 
											late-1942 and was originally designated as the EX-1. The explosive cavity in 
											the Mark 13 has a relatively thick-wall with a fairly constant sidewall 
											thickness, getting slightly thicker at the nose. It had somewhat 
											less explosive weight in terms of percent than most foreign projectiles 
											of World War II or even earlier USN HE projectiles, since it had as one 
											of its requirements the ability to penetrate light armor and heavy concrete 
											for shore bombardment purposes. The Mark 13 uses both a base delay 
											and nose contact fuzes for greater reliability under differing conditions, 
											but can be used with only one fuze if desired. During World War II 
											BuOrd developed AA shells for these guns which were standard HC rounds 
											with a mechanical time fuze replacing the usual nose contact fuze. 
											This meant that the function of the ordnance could easily be changed  
											by simply replacing the nose fuze. These AA shells do not appear to have 
											been issued their own Mark number, as they seem to have been known simply 
											as the HC Mark 13 AA round. Like the AP Mark 8, the HC Mark 13 projectile 
											has a radius of ogive of 144 inches (366 cm) or 9crh. The Mark 14 is 
											identical to the Mark 13, being simply a different designation assigned to 
											indicate manufacturers other than the Naval Gun Factory. The Naval Surface 
											Warfare Center - Crane Division located at Crane, Indiana, manufactured 
											some HC projectiles in 1969 and these were designated as Mark 14, but they 
											were otherwise identical to the Mark 13. HC projectile bodies are painted 
											green. The nose color indicates burster type, with yellow denoting Explosive 
											D. Used one of the following Nose Fuzes - Mark 29 (P.D.F.), Mark 42 or Mark 62 
											(M.T.F.) or a Nose Plug - projectile was usually issued with a nose plug which 
											could be changed out for a nose fuze on-board ship. The Nose Fuze mated with 
											one of the following Auxiliary Detonating Fuzes - Mark 17 (green stripe), Mark 
											35 or Mark 55. To ensure detonation, either the Booster Mark 5 or a special 
											0.53 lbs. (0.24 kg) pressed TNT block was used under the Auxiliary Fuze. Base 
											Fuzes - Mark 28 (green stripe); Mark 39, or Mark 48. At the time of the Korean 
											War, an HC projectile cost $1,352. In the 1980s, Mark 13 and Mark 14 projectiles 
											were both redesignated as Mark 140 Mod 0. Other Mark 13 projectiles were given 
											different fuzes and these were then redesignated as the Mark 143 and Mark 145.

											including ones based upon the HC Mark 13 and HE Mark 19 projectile bodies were 
											developed or planned. Some of these were in service during the Gulf War (1990).
											<br><p><b>HE-CVT Mark 143</b>
											<br>HC Mark 13 projectile with the Army M732 Controlled Variable
											Time (CVT) nose fuze. These fuzes provided a 20 foot (6 m) burst height for shore 
											bombardments.
											<p><b>Anti-Personnel Improved Conventional Munition (ICM) Mark 144</b>
											<br>This was the reconditioned HE Mark 19 using the Army M724 Electronic Time Fuze 
											(ETF) instead of the M565 nose fuze. The M725 could be set for times between 0.2 to 
											200 seconds in increments of a tenth of a second. Like the Mark 19, the ICM Mark 144 
											had a payload of 400 M43A1 anti-personnel grenades. The ICM Mark 144 was considered 
											exceptionally effective against personnel, aircraft and other "soft" targets. See 
											sketches for the HE Mark 19 and the ICM Mark 144 <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>.
											<p><b>HE-ET/PT Mark 145</b>
											<br>HC Mark 13 projectile with Mark 423 Point-Detonating (PD) nose fuze and Mark 48 
											Mod 4 base fuze. In 1986 there was a project authorized to convert some of these to 
											have an ASW function - details unknown. Some of these were fired by USS Iowa (BB-61) 
											during tests in 1989.
											<p><b>Anti-Personnel ICM Mark 146</b>
											<br>Similar to the ICM Mark 144 and used the same M724 Electronic Time Fuze, but 
											contained a total of 666 M42, M46 and M77 sub-munitions which are Dual Purpose 
											Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) bomblets. These are all cylindrical 
											bodied designs of the same size and incorporate an impact inertia fuze. The grenades 
											are equipped with a ribbon stabilizer which also arms the fuze in flight. The M46 
											grenade differs from the M42 and M77 in having a heavier, thicker body with a smooth 
											inner wall. ICM Mark 146 Mod 2 was similar to the Mod 1 but had a threaded base plug 
											to simplify renovation. See sketch <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>.
											<p><b>Improved HC Mark 147(?) (Planned)</b>
											<br>During the battleship reactivations of the 1980s, the Navy developed a new 
											HC shell design that was the same length as the AP Mark 8 (4.5 calibers) and weighed 
											2,240 lbs. (1,015 kg). Burster would have been about 181 lbs. (82.1 kg). Several 
											of these were test-fired from USS Iowa and at Dahlgren, achieving ranges of over 
											51,000 yards (46,600 m) with a new gun muzzle velocity of 2,825 fps (861 mps). 
											As part of this evaluation, USS Iowa (BB-61) successfully fired some of these 
											with an extra "baglet" containing 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) of propellant to extend 
											the range even further and this addition was approved for service use. This 
											projectile does not appear to have entered general service use before all of the 
											battleships were decommissioned in the early 1990s. The "Mark 147" designation 
											is my guess, it may not have been formally designated and is noted only as the 
											"2,240-lb. Extended Range projectile" in one of the sources listed below. I 
											would be interested in learning the exact designation and any other relevant 
											details about this projectile. See photograph <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>.
											<p><b>HE-ER Mark 148 (Planned)</b>
											<br>13.65 in (34.7 cm) diameter, extended-range (ER), sub-caliber cargo 
											projectile with sabot. This projectile was to be ET-fuzed with a payload of about 300 
											M46 grenade sub-munitions. Experiments with this projectile were conducted during the 
											1980s, but development was cancelled in FY91 when the battleships were decommissioned. 
											Projected range was to be in excess of 70,000 yards (64,000 m) at a muzzle velocity of 
											3,600 fps (1,097 mps). One of the dummy prototypes is currently on display at the USS 
											Iowa (BB-61) museum. See photograph and sketches <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>.
											<p><b>USNFSA Concept (Proposed)</b>
											<br>Advanced Gun Weapon Systems Technology Program 16/11-Inch Long Range GPS Concept 
											with Sabot. This concept was developed by the United States Naval Fire Support 
											Association (USNFSA). The proposal envisioned an 11 inch (28 cm) sub-caliber 
											cargo projectile utilizing a sabot to fit into the 16"/50 (40.6 cm) gun barrel. A 
											sketch of this projectile may be seen <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>. 
											This projectile did not become an official development program, but the Navy did develop 
											their own sub-caliber cargo round, the HE-ER Mark 148 described above. The following 
											data for the Concept is courtesy of USNFSA:
											<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Range: 100 nm

											charge weight was originally 571 lbs. (259 kg) for a MV of 2,690 fps (820 mps). 
											This was apparently later increased to 593 lbs. (269.0 kg) D846 charge for the 
											same 2,690 fps (820 mps) muzzle velocity. This may have been the result of the age 
											of the propellant. See Muzzle Velocity Note below.  Each Full Charge D846 powder 
											bag had a 0.77 lbs. (0.35 kg) black powder bag igniter (primer patch). Testing

											degrade over time, a few years later during the Korean deployments MV 
											varied about +/- 14 fps (4.3 mps) and during Vietnam about +/- 23 fps 
											(7 mps). By the time of the 1980s deployments, shot to shot variation 
											was about +/- 32 fps (9.8 mps). This large variation was a primary 
											contributor to USS New Jersey's poor shooting off Lebanon in 1984. As a 
											result, the NSWC Dahlgren facility and USS Iowa were tasked with improving 
											performance. Old propellant lots were remixed and proved to bring the variation

											0.43 ESR and at 1,900 fps (579 mps) were 0.03 ESR. The Target rounds at 1,800 fps 
											(549 mps) were 0.08 ESR. In the 1967 and 1980s deployments, the use of 
											"Swedish Additive" (titanium dioxide and wax) greatly reduced barrel wear. It 
											has been estimated that four AP shells fired using this additive approximated the 
											wear of a single AP shell fired without the additive (0.26 ESR) and that HC rounds 
											fired with the additive caused even less wear (0.11 ESR). The "Swedish Additive" 
											was issued in a packet that was inserted between two of the propellant bags. Later 
											developments during the 1980s deployment led to putting a polyurethane jacket over 
											the powder bags, which reduced the wear still further. This jacket was simply a 
											sheet of foam with a fabric border around the ends that was tied to the powder bag. 
											When the jacket burned during firing, a protective layer formed over the surface 
											of the liner, greatly reducing gaseous erosion. This wear reduction program was so 
											successful that liner life could no longer be rated in terms of ESR, as it was no 
											longer the limiting factor. Instead, the liner life began to be rated in terms of 
											Fatigue Equivalent Rounds (FER), which is the mechanical fatigue life expressed in 
											terms of the number of mechanical cycles. The 16"/50 (40.6 cm) Mark 7 was ultimately

											originally to have used the same gun as planned for the never-built South
											Dakota BB-49 class, the <a href="WNUS_16-50_mk2.php">16"/50 (40.6 cm) Mark
											2</a>. In April of 1938, during a General Board review, BuOrd produced sketches for 
											a standard turret using these guns and also showed a new, lightweight turret that would 
											still use the  16"/50 Mark 2 guns. However, this lightweight turret was just a paper 
											study, it was not a real design that BuOrd was actively studying. Not fully 
											understanding this, the General Board selected the lightweight turret, but did not make 
											this clear to the BuOrd representatives. As a result of this mistaken understanding, 
											the ship designers of the Bureau of Construction and Repair (BuC&R) and BuOrd came away 
											with different conclusions as to which turret would be used; the ship designers going with 
											the lighter, smaller turret and BuOrd going with the heavier turret. This discrepancy 
											was not found until November 1938, causing much consternation to all parties. Fortunately, 
											BuOrd was able to quickly propose a smaller, lighter gun which became the 16"/50 Mark 7. 
											These guns could use the lighter turret design and by the end of 1938 all parties were 
											finally working on the same page. This new mounting was about the same size as the 
											three-gun <a href="WNUS_16-45_mk6.php">16"/45 (40.6 cm) turrets</a> used for the North 
											Carolina BB-55 and South Dakota BB-57 classes, which meant that the turret training pinions 
											were crowded together and difficult to access.</div></div></li><li data-id="2f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote2"><div><span class="notecaret"><a href="#mountnote2.1back">^</a></span><div class="notetext">These mountings do not have a working chamber and both shell and propellant 
											hoists are single stage types running directly up to the gunhouse. Effectively, the powder 
											handling room at the bottom of the stalk acts as a working chamber as the powder circle 
											compartment outside of it forms a double-wall isolation between the hoists and the propellant 
											magazines. See powder handling room sketch <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>.</div></div></li><li data-id="3f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote3"><div><span class="notecaret"><a href="#mountnote3.1back">^</a></span><div class="notetext">The turrets for the Montana class would have been similar to

										propellant hoist. Each shell ring was powered by a 40 hp electric motor. 
										Training arcs were restricted during the 1980s activations in order to avoid

											nominal figure. The absolute, metal-to-metal recoil distance was
											48 inches (122 cm). When the gun is fired with full charges at a
											+15 degree elevation, recoil lasts 0.43 seconds and counter recoil (runout)
											lasts 0.90 seconds. During runout, the gun is automatically lowered
											to the loading position, thus speeding up the firing cycle time.</div></div></li><li data-id="6f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote6"><div><div class="notetext">As built, all three turrets on the Iowa 
								class had 25 power, 46 foot (14 m) rangefinders, with Stereoscopic Mark 
								52 used in Turrets II and III and Coincidence Mark 53 in Turret I. 
								The Mark 52 weighs 10,500 lbs. (4,763 kg) and cost about $100,000 US during 
								World War II. Near focus for the Mark 52 is 5,000 yards (4,570 m) 
								and the maximum range is 45,000 yards (41,150 m). Mark 53 was a coincidence 
								type with a special astigmatic lens which allowed it to range in on a single 
								point source, such as a searchlight. In the 1950s, the Mark 53 rangefinder 
								was removed from all four Iowa class battleships as weight compensation 
								for growth in other areas. This rangefinder was selected as the increasing 
								sophistication of fire control radar made its special capability redundant. 
								The lower height of Turret I above the water also meant that this mounting 
								had a shorter distance to the horizon capability. The openings in 
								Turret I were then armor-plated over, as can be seen in the photographs 
								<a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a>.</div></div></li><li data-id="7f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote7"><div><div class="notetext">OP 769 says that the minimum crew for each turret was 1 officer 
								and 76 men, not including those in the powder magazines. The normal crew size was 
								closer to 94, including the crewmen in the magazine and powder handling spaces. 
								This count agrees with the description in the post-war NavPers 16116-B. See 
								notes for the powder room sketch <a href="#Additional_Pictures">below</a> for 
								additional details.</div></div></li><li data-id="8f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote8"><div><div class="notetext">These mountings used delay coils, which 
								delayed the firing of the guns by about 0.060 seconds (60 milliseconds). 
								This delay, plus a wider spacing between the gun barrels than on the older 
								ships, improved the dispersion patterns. The firing order was left, 
								right, center. During the 1980s activations, agastats (time delay relays) 
								were fitted to the right and left gun and these created a turret-whipping 
								problem. This was corrected by increasing the delay in the right gun to 1 
								second. Wisconsin differed from her sisters in having a 1 second delay for 
								the left gun and 2 seconds for the right gun.</div></div></li><li data-id="9f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote9"><div><div class="notetext">The gun axes are 122 in (310 cm) apart 
								according to BuOrd OP 769. "Naval Weapons of World War Two" mistakenly 
								says 117 in (297 cm), the same as this reference lists for the 
								<a href="WNUS_16-45_mk6.php">16"/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 6</a> guns used on the 
								North Carolina (BB-55) and South Dakota (BB-57) classes.</div></div></li><li data-id="10f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote10"><div><div class="notetext">These turrets cost about $1,400,000 US each, not including 
								the cost of the guns themselves.</div></div></li><li data-id="11f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote11"><div><div class="notetext">As was typical of US designs of this period, guns could 
								be removed and replaced without dismantling the gunhouse.</div></div></li><li data-id="12f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote12"><div><div class="notetext">When inspected during the initial reactivation
								process in the 1980s, all twelve turrets on the four battleships of the
								Iowa class were found to be in excellent shape thanks to the care taken
								during their deactivations. The largest problem found was in the
								elevation power drives for two of the guns on USS Iowa (BB-61). These
								guns were unable to hold elevation and would oscillate around at the desired
								setting. Investigation of the historical records showed that the
								problem had existed at the time of her deactivation and that major repair
								efforts had been underway at that time. Repairs during the 1980s
								reactivation were hampered by the thirty-year hiatus since she was placed
								in reserve, as this meant that very few personnel were familiar with the
								complexities of the equipment. This necessarily meant that a long
								learning process was required to acquaint maintenance personnel with the
								equipment involved.
								<p><blockquote>"Secondly, a preservative (cosmoline),
								which was used to preserve the equipment during deactivation, was a major
								problem that hindered the investigative work. The preservative, because
								of the long term deactivation period, had become hardened, making it difficult
								to remove. As the systems were reactivated and operated, this preservative
								would continually work loose. This material would then clog orifices,
								etc., in the Servo Control System causing erratic equipment operation which
								complicated the investigative process. Eventually, the source of
								the problem was pinpointed on both guns. For one of these guns, it
								meant the replacement of a major assembly - the A-end pump. The other
								gun was corrected by replacing a major sub-assembly and the fine adjustment
								of the regulator assembly" - from "Reactivation of 16-inch Three Gun Turrets
								in the Battleship."</blockquote>
								<p>Other than these two items on USS Iowa, it
								was found that the only other gunnery-related items requiring replacement
								were the breech closing control valves. Because of deterioration
								from age and use, all of the original valves were not able to hold pressure
								and so were replaced by a commercially available valve that was a direct
								replacement for the original one. Repair kits containing the new
								valves were added to the Naval supply system to ensure logistical support.
								To solve the problem with the preservative fouling the hydraulic systems,
								a large capacity 0.5 micron filter system with an integral motor/pump assembly
								was installed on each train and elevation unit during reactivation.
								These units worked continuously to filter the hydraulic fluid. This
								system was outside of the normal hydraulic system and operated even when
								the mountings were not in use, thus ensuring cleanliness of the hydraulic
								fluid.</div></div></li><li data-id="13f" class="noteitem" id="mountnote13"><div><div class="notetext">Turret armor thickness for the Iowa Class

This was at the lowest level of the stalk, located below the projectile flats. Note that the powder scuttles are arranged in pairs. The magazine scuttle was used to move the propellant bags from the powder magazines and into the Powder Circle Compartment. The powder room scuttle moved the bags into the powder room where 
								they were then taken to the propellant hoists. Thus there was a double isolation between the powder rooms and the hoists. The propellant hoists were inside the stalk and rotated with the gunhouse. Note the three "Third Powderman" crewmen in the space between the two outer circles (which is known as the "Powder Circle" compartment). This arrangement is in accordance with OP 769, the handbook for the 16"/50 (40.6 cm) Three-gun turrets. However, 
								in OP 769, it was assumed that the First and Second Powdermen for each gun would work the powder room scuttles and move the bags to the hoist. Which means that each man would have to squat down, pull the scuttle handle, stand up, move over, crouch down, pick up the bag - each weighing about 115 lbs. (52.2 kg) - and then walk the bag over to the hoist. Each of the two men would thus need to do this three times every 30 seconds in order to support 
								a ROF of 2 rpmpg. During this same 30 seconds, each Third Powderman would need to operate the magazine scuttle and push a propellant bag over to the powder room scuttle six times. This sort of heavy lifting/pushing would quickly tire out all nine powdermen. To reduce the workload, the gunnery officers moved the three Third Powdermen to inside the powder room to move the bags from the scuttles to the hoists and added a Fourth Powderman who operated 
								the powder room scuttle, thus reducing the workload for each Powderman. They then added six powder pushers inside the powder circle, apparently one for each set of scuttles.</figcaption></figure><figure  class="galleryitem"><a class="galleryimg" href="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load1_pic.jpg" data-sub-html="#gallery-caption21"><img loading="lazy" src="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load1_pic.jpg" title="Click for larger image."></img></a><figcaption id="gallery-caption21">These next four photographs show the loading and firing of a HC round on USS Iowa BB-61 on 14 December 1986 - the arrangements for the <a href="WNUS_16-45_mk6.php">16"/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 6</a> guns used on the North Carolina (BB-55) class and South Dakota (BB-57) class battleships were nearly identical. This is either the right or the center gun position. The "1,000 USS 
								IOWA" stencil is a reference to this particular projectile being the 1,000th round fired by the 16 inch (40.6 cm) guns on Iowa since the ship's recommissioning. In this first photograph, the projectile has been delivered vertically to the gunhouse and is now being tilted over for ramming. The ramming tray is being extended by the cradle operator to span the gap between the projectile bucket and the breech while the gun captain watches. The open 
								breech plug can be seen below the ramming tray. The primer man, not shown in this photograph, is underneath the catwalk that the gun captain is standing on and has already replaced the primer cartridge in the breech plug with a fresh one. Note the the gauntlet on the gun captain's left arm which is used to wipe down the gas check pad when the breech opens. The red stripe on the left bulkhead indicates the limit of the gun recoil. Note that many items 
								such as the ramming tray and the catwalks are made from brass so as to reduce the chances of a spark being generated.</figcaption></figure><figure  class="galleryitem"><a class="galleryimg" href="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load2_pic.jpg" data-sub-html="#gallery-caption22"><img loading="lazy" src="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load2_pic.jpg" title="Click for larger image."></img></a><figcaption id="gallery-caption22">This photograph shows the propellant bags being delivered by the powder hoist. The rammer operator is at lower left and the cradle operator is assisting the gun captain in moving the propellant bags. The door to the hoist opens to provide a ramp down which the bags are rolled. The propellant hoist cage has two levels, each holding three propellant bags. After the 
								first three bags are unloaded, the cage indexes downwards to unload the remaining three bags. At upper right can be seen the camera flash box.</figcaption></figure><figure  class="galleryitem"><a class="galleryimg" href="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load3_pic.jpg" data-sub-html="#gallery-caption23"><img loading="lazy" src="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load3_pic.jpg" title="Click for larger image."></img></a><figcaption id="gallery-caption23">In this photograph, the gun captain is signaling to the rammer operator to ram the powder bags into the breech. Normally, all six bags were rammed together into the breech with a single rammer stroke, but during testing during the 1980 deployments, bags were occasionally rammed three at a time as in this photograph. The red quilted primer patch on the 
								end of each bag holds the black powder igniter. The bags in this photograph appear to be reduced charge bags, which are smaller than full charge bags. Full charge bags may be seen in the photographs further above.</figcaption></figure><figure  class="galleryitem"><a class="galleryimg" href="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load4_pic.jpg" data-sub-html="#gallery-caption24"><img loading="lazy" src="WNUS_16-50_mk7_load4_pic.jpg" title="Click for larger image."></img></a><figcaption id="gallery-caption24">In this last photograph, the gun is shown as it fires and is about two-thirds of the way through its recoil. Note the folded-up ramming tray in the lower left hand corner of the photograph.
								The red stripes on the grooves for the counter-recoil cylinders indicate the correct position of the cylinders when the gun is in battery. Note that in these photographs that the counter-recoil cylinders appear to be oval shaped and of different sizes. This
								is simply the result of the photographer using a fish-eye lens to capture more of the loading activities, as both cylinders were actually round and of equal size.

									it actually stands for "Washington Navy Yard" which is located in Washington, D.C. and is where the Naval Gun Factory was located. "Watervliet Arsenal" is a US Army establishment which often made large caliber gun forgings for the US Navy and shipped 
									them to the Naval Gun Factory for further processing into the finished guns. For example, Watervliet Arsenal did the initial work on the <a href="WNUS_12-50_mk8.php">12"/50 (30.5 cm) Mark 8 guns</a> for the Alaska class (CB-1) until the guns were about 
									65 percent complete and then shipped them to the Naval Gun Factory for finishing. Smaller caliber guns actually finished by the Arsenal were stamped "Watervliet Arsenal" and not "W.N.Y."
