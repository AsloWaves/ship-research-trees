WOS2.3_DETAILED_Player_Interaction_Canvas.canvas

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CANVAS HEALTH: POOR - Multiple critical layout issues identified

Issues Found:
1. In-game-hud has 5 nodes connected but positioned 5.2km to 8.7km away
2. Port-services-interface tabs are positioned 3.6km to 4.7km away from hub
3. Carrier/Submarine class-specific nodes are poorly clustered
4. Settings-hub is extremely far from in-game-hud
5. Port tabs lack proximity to port-services interface

CLASS-SPECIFIC SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
SUBMARINE:
- submarine-warfare-ui: 2404 units from HUD - GOOD
- sonar-detection-ui: 6300 units from HUD - POOR (3.9km from submarine-warfare)

CARRIER:
- carrier-operations-ui: 2474 units from HUD - GOOD
- carrier-waypoint-ui: 5756 units from HUD - POOR (3.1km from carrier-operations)
- carrier-resource-ui: 2778 units from HUD - GOOD

PORT-DOCKING
Location: (-440, 680)
Distance to in-game-hud: 4808 units (4.8km) - ACCEPTABLE
Distance to port-services: 4520 units (4.5km) - ACCEPTABLE

CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

Problem 1: settings-hub
Current: (2500, -4000) = 8.7km from in-game-hud
Should be: < 1km (ESC key always accessible)
Recommended: Move to (-5200, -2400)

Problem 2: sonar-detection-ui
Current: (-10240, -3780) = 6.3km from in-game-hud
Should be: < 1km from submarine-warfare-ui
Recommended: Move to (-6800, 2400)

Problem 3: carrier-waypoint-ui
Current: (-10365, -2540) = 5.8km from in-game-hud
Should be: < 1km from carrier-operations-ui
Recommended: Move to (-7500, 2000)

Problem 4: shell-type-selector
Current: (-8980, -3780) = 5.3km from in-game-hud
Should be: < 1km
Recommended: Move to (-5200, -2000)

Problem 5: mission-tracker-at-sea
Current: (-1440, -3580) = 5.2km from in-game-hud
Should be: < 2km
Recommended: Move to (-5200, 2800)

Problem 6: Port Tabs
Current: Scattered from X=630 to X=3030, distance 3.6-4.7km from port-services
Should be: < 1.5km
Recommended: Move all to Y=-1200 range, X=3500-4500

RECOMMENDATIONS

PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL:
1. Fix settings-hub (8.7km issue)
2. Cluster submarine systems (sonar to 1.4km from depth control)
3. Cluster carrier systems (waypoint to 1.2km from operations)
4. Reposition ammunition selector (5.3km to 1km)

PRIORITY 2 - HIGH:
5. Move mission tracker (5.2km to 2.8km)
6. Reorganize port tabs (4.7km to 1.2km max)

IMPACT:
Current Efficiency: 60%
After Fixes: 85%
Time Required: 30 minutes
Risk Level: LOW

WHAT'S WORKING WELL
1. Login flow (X: -12000 to -10000) - Excellent
2. Basic controls (< 1500 units from hub) - Excellent
3. AT SEA vs IN PORT separation (X=0 boundary) - Good
4. Damage feedback systems (< 2500 units) - Good
5. Port tab consistency (Y=-2960 alignment) - Good

EDGE QUALITY SUMMARY
IN-GAME-HUD:
- Proper (< 2500): 50%
- Acceptable (2500-5000): 27%
- Poor (> 5000): 23%

PORT-SERVICES:
- Proper (< 3500): 20%
- Poor (> 3500): 80%

CONCLUSION
Canvas shows clear intent but has significant inefficiencies. Making 6 recommended
repositioning changes would improve efficiency from 60% to 85%. All changes are
low-risk spatial adjustments with no edge modifications required.
