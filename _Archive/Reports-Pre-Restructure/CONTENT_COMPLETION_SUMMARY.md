## Efficiency Recommendations

### Batch Creation Approach

Given the scope of remaining work (50-60 files), I recommend:

1. **Template-Based Generation**
   - Create standardized templates for each category
   - Use Wikipedia/Naval-History.net for quick research
   - Focus on essential specs and 1-2 paragraph history

2. **Prioritize by Impact**
   - **HIGH:** Japanese and British amphibious ships (critical gap)
   - **MEDIUM:** Modern missiles (balance gap)
   - **LOW:** Additional variants and minor systems

3. **Parallel Research Agents**
   - Use multiple research agents simultaneously
   - Gather data for 5-10 ships/missiles at once
   - Batch-create files to reduce overhead

4. **Progressive Completion**
   - Phase 1: Create stub files with basic specs (quick)
   - Phase 2: Add historical notes later (research-intensive)
   - Phase 3: Cross-link and integrate into tech trees

## Estimated Effort

| Task | Files | Est. Time | Priority |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| British Amphibious Ships | 10-12 | 3-4 hours | HIGH |
| Japanese Amphibious Ships | 6-8 | 2-3 hours | HIGH |
| Japanese Modern Missiles | 15-18 | 4-5 hours | MEDIUM |
| British Modern Missiles | 10-12 | 3-4 hours | MEDIUM |
| German Modern Missiles | 10-12 | 3-4 hours | MEDIUM |
| **TOTAL** | **51-62** | **15-20 hours** | |

## Scripts to Create

To expedite remaining work, create these helper scripts:

1. **`generate_amphibious_ships.py`**
   - Takes list of ship classes
   - Fetches Wikipedia data
   - Generates markdown files from template

2. **`generate_missiles.py`**
   - Takes list of missile designations
   - Fetches specs from military databases
   - Generates standardized missile files

3. **`batch_research.py`**
   - Runs multiple web searches in parallel
   - Caches results for offline file creation
   - Generates research summary reports

## Current Repository State

**Overall Completion:** 61.8% → ~64% (after bombers)

| Section | Complete | Partial | Total | % Complete |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| **Ships** | TBD | TBD | 780 | TBD |
| **Aircraft** | TBD | TBD | 399 | ~100% |
| **Weapons** | 1,912 | 926 | 2,838 | 67.4% |

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Start with British Amphibious Ships** (highest priority gap)
2. **Create 3-5 example files** to establish pattern
3. **Use batch creation** for remaining files
4. **Focus on functionality** over perfection (can enhance later)
5. **Commit frequently** to save progress
