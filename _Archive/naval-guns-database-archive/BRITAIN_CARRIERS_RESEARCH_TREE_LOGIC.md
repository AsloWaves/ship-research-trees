## Overview

British aircraft carrier development from pioneering WWI conversions through WWII armored carriers to modern supercarriers. Britain pioneered carrier aviation with HMS Furious (1917) and HMS Argus (1918), developed the revolutionary armored flight deck concept (Illustrious class), and built modern supercarriers (Queen Elizabeth class).

**Key Innovations**:
- **First Conversions** (1917-1918): HMS Furious, HMS Argus - pioneering carrier conversions
- **Armored Flight Deck** (1940): Illustrious class - revolutionary armored "box" hangar design, 3" armored deck
- **Light Fleet Carriers** (1944): Colossus class - mass-produced escort carriers
- **Postwar Fleet Carriers** (1951-1955): Audacious class - large conventional carriers
- **Through-Deck Cruisers** (1980): Invincible class - VSTOL carriers with Sea Harrier
- **Modern Supercarriers** (2017): Queen Elizabeth class - 65,000-ton STOVL carriers with F-35B

**Total Nodes**: 40 carriers spanning 1917-2030s

## Branch Descriptions

### 1. Starting (2 nodes)
FREE starting carriers for tutorial and early gameplay. HMS Furious (1917) represents the first battlecruiser conversion with forward flight deck. HMS Argus (1918) was the world's first flush-deck carrier. Both pioneered naval aviation.

### 2. Early Conversions (3 nodes)
Large battlecruiser conversions (Courageous, Glorious) and HMS Furious full reconstruction (1925). These were fast carriers (30+ kts) but vulnerable due to thin armor. Critical for interwar fleet development.

### 3. Early Dedicated (3 nodes)
First purpose-built carriers including HMS Hermes (1924), the first British carrier designed as such from the keel up. HMS Eagle converted from Chilean battleship. HMS Ark Royal (1938) was Britain's first modern fleet carrier with 60 aircraft capacity.

### 4. Armored Fleet Main (4 nodes)
Revolutionary Illustrious class (1940-1941) with 3" armored flight deck. Traded aircraft capacity (36 vs 60-80 on US carriers) for survivability. The "armored box" hangar design was a British innovation. Ships survived multiple bomb/kamikaze hits that would have sunk other carriers.

### 5. Armored Improved (2 nodes)
Implacable class (1944) improved on Illustrious design with better hangar arrangement, increased aircraft capacity (54), and reinforced armor. Last British armored carriers.

### 6. Light Fleet (4 nodes)
Colossus/Majestic class (1944-1955) were mass-produced light carriers (13,190 tons) for escort duties. 16 ships completed, many sold to allied navies (Australia, Canada, India, etc.). Cost-effective design for ASW and convoy protection.

### 7. Postwar Fleet (3 nodes)
Audacious class carriers (HMS Eagle 1951, HMS Ark Royal 1955) were large conventional carriers (36,800 tons) with angled decks and steam catapults. HMS Ark Royal operated until 1978, serving as Britain's primary carrier for decades.

### 8. Postwar Light (4 nodes)
Centaur/Hermes class light carriers (24,000-28,700 tons) for ASW and amphibious operations. HMS Hermes (1959) was Britain's last conventional carrier, serving until 2017 (including Falklands War 1982). Several converted to commando carriers.

### 9. Through-Deck Cruisers (3 nodes)
Invincible class (1980-1985) were officially "through-deck cruisers" to avoid political opposition to "aircraft carriers." 20,600 tons, operated Sea Harrier V/STOL fighters with ski-jump launch. Proven in Falklands War. Bridge to modern carriers.

### 10. Supercarrier (3 nodes)
Queen Elizabeth class (2017-2019) are Britain's largest warships ever built (65,000 tons full load). Operate F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters (40 aircraft) with ski-jump STOVL operations. HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales restore Britain's carrier strike capability. Future enhancements may include electromagnetic catapults (EMALS).

### 11. Modernization (4 nodes)
Major carrier refits including HMS Victorious 1950s reconstruction (angled deck, steam catapults), HMS Ark Royal 1970s Phantom/Buccaneer capability, and Invincible class 1990s upgrades. Extends carrier service life and capabilities.

### 12. Paper Ships (5 nodes)
Cancelled designs including Malta class (1945, large fleet carriers cancelled postwar), CVA-01 (1966, modern supercarrier cancelled by Labour government in controversial decision that eliminated fixed-wing carrier capability until Queen Elizabeth class). All paper ships have reliability penalties (-10% to -15%).
