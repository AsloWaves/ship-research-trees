# German Destroyers Research Tree Logic

## Overview

This document defines the research tree structure for German Destroyers (DD) in the naval warfare system, covering the evolution from early torpedo boats (1898) through WWI large torpedo boats, interwar designs, WWII destroyer types, and paper ships. The German destroyer program is characterized by the transition from small coastal torpedo boats to large ocean-going destroyers, culminating in the revolutionary Type 1936A "Narvik" class with 150mm guns.

**Node ID Range**: 3700-3738 (39 nodes)
**Nation**: Germany
**Ship Type**: DD (Destroyer)
**Time Period**: 1898-1950s
**Tech Tiers**: 1-10

## Historical Context

### Kaiserliche Marine Era (1898-1918)

Germany's destroyer development began with small torpedo boats in the 1890s, progressively evolving into larger "Large Torpedo Boats" (Große Torpedoboote) that were effectively destroyers. The V25-class (1913) was numerically the largest class ever built for the High Seas Fleet with 71 ships, establishing Germany as a major torpedo warfare power.

### Interwar Period (1920s)

Post-WWI Treaty restrictions forced Germany to build small torpedo boats (Types 23 and 24) disguised as "fleet torpedo boats" but limited to under 800 tons. These vessels, named after birds and predators, maintained German expertise during the Versailles Treaty period.

### Kriegsmarine Era (1934-1945)

Nazi Germany's rearmament program produced modern large destroyers starting with Type 1934. The revolutionary Type 1936A "Narvik" class (Z23-Z30) introduced 150mm (5.9") guns—unprecedented firepower for destroyers—and became the most famous German destroyer class of WWII. Later types refined the design with improved AA capabilities.

## Key Innovations

1. **V25-Class Mass Production** (1913): 71 ships of a single class, largest destroyer class ever built for Germany
2. **Type 1934 Modern Destroyer** (1934): First post-Versailles large destroyer, 3165 tons, 5×127mm guns
3. **Type 1936A "Narvik"** (1939): Revolutionary 150mm (5.9") guns on destroyers, unprecedented firepower (+40% over 127mm)
4. **Type 1936B Balanced Design** (1941): Return to 127mm guns with improved AA capabilities
5. **Type 1942 Diesel Innovation** (1942): Experimental diesel-powered destroyer for extended range

## Branch Descriptions

### 1. Starting (2 nodes)
SMS S90 (1898) and SMS G108 (1900) were Germany's first modern torpedo boats. Both FREE starting ships for tutorial purposes. S90-class established the torpedo boat template with 3×450mm torpedoes, while G108-class improved speed to 29 kts with early turbine technology.

### 2. Early Torpedo Boats (3 nodes)
Pre-1906 torpedo boat evolution. S114-class (1902) refined coastal operations. S138-class (1906) and V150-class (1907) represented the 1906 Type program with turbine propulsion and improved seakeeping for North Sea operations.

### 3. WWI Large Torpedo Boats (4 nodes)
The 1911 Program (Torpedoboot 1911) created the first true "Large Torpedo Boats" that were effectively destroyers. V1-class, G7-class, and S13-class all featured 2×8.8cm guns and 4×50cm torpedoes on 573-ton hulls. S31-class (1912) refined this design. These ships fought throughout WWI, with many losses at Jutland and in North Sea operations.

### 4. WWI Main Line (3 nodes)
V25-class (Type 1913) was numerically the largest destroyer class ever built for Germany with 71 ships constructed! This mass production established German torpedo warfare doctrine. Ships measured 78-83m long with 3×10.5cm guns (upgraded from 8.8cm) and 6×50cm torpedoes. G37-class and V43-class were variants of the Type 1913 design. These formed the backbone of the High Seas Fleet destroyer force.

### 5. WWI Advanced (3 nodes)
The 1914 Type represented the ultimate WWI German destroyer design. B97-class, G101-class, and V105-class introduced improved engines, better seakeeping, and enhanced armament. Many of these ships were completed late in the war and saw limited service, but represented the culmination of German WWI destroyer development.

### 6. Interwar Type 23/24 (4 nodes)
Post-Versailles Treaty restrictions limited Germany to small "torpedo boats" under 800 tons. Type 23 (1926-1927) ships were named after birds of prey: Möwe (Seagull), Greif (Griffon), Seeadler, Albatros, Kondor, Falke. Type 24 (1928-1929) were named after predators: Wolf, Iltis, Jaguar, Leopard, Luchs, Tiger. Displacing 923-932 tons with 3×105mm guns, these maintained German destroyer expertise during the treaty period.

### 7. Type 1934/1934A (3 nodes)
Nazi rearmament produced the first modern German destroyers. Z1 "Leberecht Maass" (1937) was revolutionary at 3165 tons full load with 5×127mm guns and 8×533mm torpedoes. Z3 "Max Schultz" and subsequent Type 1934A ships (Z5 "Paul Jacobi" through Z16) refined the design. These were Germany's first true ocean-going destroyers since WWI, capable of 38.4 kts. The class suffered from stability problems due to excessive top-weight.

### 8. Type 1936/1936A "Narvik" (5 nodes)
Type 1936 (Z17 "Diether von Roeder" through Z22) were enlarged to 1811 tons standard with improved seakeeping and 40 kts speed. The revolutionary Type 1936A "Narvik" class (Z23-Z30, 1940-1941) introduced 150mm (5.9") guns—unprecedented firepower for destroyers, giving them cruiser-level punch (+40% firepower over 127mm guns). Z23, Z25, and Z28 represent this famous class that fought throughout WWII in the Arctic, North Sea, and Channel operations. The "Narvik" name comes from their participation in the Battles of Narvik (1940).

### 9. Type 1936B/C (4 nodes)
Late-war designs returned to 127mm guns but with improved dual-purpose capability for better AA defense. Type 1936B (Z35-Z45) balanced gun size with fire control improvements. Type 1936C (Z46-Z50) planned 128mm dual-purpose guns but were never completed due to war conditions. These represented German lessons learned about destroyer requirements after combat experience.

### 10. Modernization (3 nodes)
V25 Modernization (1917) upgraded WWI destroyers with 10.5cm guns. Type 1934 Refit (1942) enhanced AA armament for surviving pre-war destroyers. Type 1936A Refit (1943) improved AA fire control and added radar to Narvik-class ships for late-war operations.

### 11. Paper Ships (5 nodes)
Z51 (Type 1942) was an experimental diesel-powered destroyer for extended range (+30%) but never completed. Type 1944 represented the most advanced WWII design with 6×128mm dual-purpose guns and 8 MAN diesel engines but never reached construction. Type 1945, Post-War Destroyer, and Future DD Concept represent theoretical post-war German destroyer development.

## Gameplay Notes

### Balance Considerations

1. **Starting Ships**: Two FREE torpedo boats (S90, G108) provide tutorial introduction
2. **Historical Mass Production**: V25-class (71 ships) gets production efficiency bonus
3. **Revolutionary Technology**: Type 1936A "Narvik" gets significant firepower bonus for 150mm guns
4. **Progressive Tiers**: Gradual advancement from 388-ton torpedo boats to 3400-ton destroyers
5. **Cost Scaling**: Research costs from FREE (Tier 1) to 120,000 RP (Tier 10)
6. **Build Time**: 24 days (early torpedo boats) to 120 days (advanced paper ships)

### German Destroyer Characteristics

**Strengths**:
- Heavy gun armament (150mm on Type 1936A unprecedented for destroyers)
- Excellent torpedo warfare capability (+20% national bonus)
- German engineering reliability (+15% national bonus)
- High speed (40 kts on Type 1936)

**Weaknesses**:
- Stability problems (especially early Type 1934)
- AA capability weaker than Allied destroyers until late war
- Smaller numbers than Royal Navy or USN
- Many late-war types never completed

### Strategic Role

German destroyers specialized in:
1. **Torpedo Warfare**: Primary weapon against capital ships
2. **Commerce Raiding**: Handelskrieg doctrine (+25% effectiveness)
3. **Fleet Screening**: Protecting capital ships from torpedo attack
4. **Minelaying**: Many carried 24+ mines for offensive mining
5. **Arctic Operations**: Type 1936A "Narvik" class excelled in Norwegian waters
