# USA Landing Ship Medium (LSM) Classes Database

**Export Date**: October 23, 2025
**Database Version**: 1.0
**Total Records**: 2 LSM classes (1944-1945 coverage)

## Overview

This document contains USA Landing Ship Medium (LSM) entries for the Naval Ships Database. LSMs were 203-foot amphibious warfare vessels designed to transport equipment, supplies, and troops directly to invasion beaches. Smaller and more versatile than LSTs (Landing Ship, Tank), they could carry 5 medium tanks or 6 LVTs with shallow draft beaching capability.

**ID Range**: 15100-15199 (USA Landing Ships Medium)
- LSM-1 Class (Standard): 15100-15149
- LSM(R)-188 Class (Rocket): 15150-15199

**Historical Context**: 558 LSMs were built between 1944-1945, making them one of the most numerous amphibious ship classes of WWII. Admiral Daniel Barbey, chief of Pacific invasion forces, called them the "ultimate amphibious ship" and stated each was "worth their weight in gold" at Leyte, Iwo Jima, Luzon, and Okinawa. Nicknamed "Sandscrapers" for their shallow 6-foot bow draft when loaded.

Notes: The LSM-1 class represented the pinnacle of wartime amphibious ship design evolution. With 558 ships built in just 22 months (April 1944 - February 1946), they were one of the most numerous ship classes of WWII. Admiral Daniel Barbey praised them as "ultimate amphibious ships" worth their weight in gold at Leyte, Iwo Jima, Luzon, and Okinawa. Their shallow 6-foot bow draft when loaded earned the nickname "Sandscrapers." Primary builders included Brown Shipbuilding (254 ships), Charleston Navy Yard (140 ships), and Dravo Corporation (65 ships). The class could carry 5 medium tanks or 6 LVTs directly onto invasion beaches. First ship LSM-1 commissioned May 5, 1944; last ship LSM-500 commissioned May 17, 1945. Most decommissioned in 1946, though many served in Korean War and some in Vietnam War. Their versatility, reliability, and beach-assault capability made them invaluable for Pacific island-hopping campaigns. At Iwo Jima, these "sturdy little craft" delivered five Sherman tanks at a time under heavy fire. The class demonstrated that medium-sized amphibious ships could combine the beaching capability of LSTs with the maneuverability needed for complex assault operations.

Notes: The LSM(R)-188 class represented a radical conversion of the LSM-1 hull into a devastating shore bombardment platform. Twelve ships (LSM(R)-188 through LSM(R)-199) were converted in late 1944 to provide close-in rocket fire support for amphibious assaults. Each ship bristled with 75-85 rocket launchers capable of unleashing a massive barrage at short range. Life Magazine featured them in April 1945, noting their firepower exceeded two Iowa-class battleships at close range. First combat action occurred March 26, 1945, with a dawn rocket barrage on Kerama Retto. LSM(R)-188 was hit by a kamikaze on March 28, 1945, suffering 15 killed and 32 wounded, ending her combat career. Six ships participated in the April 1, 1945 Okinawa invasion. Several were lost to kamikaze attacks in May 1945. The class demonstrated the effectiveness of saturation rocket fire for suppressing beach defenses, though vulnerability to air attack remained a critical weakness. Some ships were reactivated for Korean War service under the LSMR designation, with vessels like USS White River (LSMR-536) serving through Vietnam. The conversion eliminated cargo capacity but created floating rocket batteries that could approach hostile shores and deliver devastating preparatory bombardment before the main assault waves landed.

## Operational Legacy

The LSM-1 class proved Admiral Barbey's assessment as "ultimate amphibious ships" accurate through their exceptional versatility and reliability. With 558 ships built, they were instrumental in every major Pacific amphibious operation from late 1944 through war's end. Their shallow draft, beaching capability, and cargo versatility made them indispensable for island-hopping campaigns.

The LSM(R)-188 rocket variant, though only 12 ships strong, demonstrated the devastating effectiveness of concentrated rocket fire for beach suppression. Despite vulnerability to kamikaze attacks, they proved their worth at Kerama Retto and Okinawa. Several ships' reactivation for Korean and Vietnam Wars under the LSMR designation validated the fire support concept for decades.

Both classes exemplified American wartime industrial capacity: rapid design, standardized production across multiple yards, and tactical innovation under combat pressure. The "Sandscrapers" delivered Sherman tanks under fire at Iwo Jima, while their rocket-armed cousins unleashed firepower rivaling battleships at point-blank range. Together, they represent the evolution of amphibious warfare from simple beach landings to coordinated assault operations with integral fire support.
