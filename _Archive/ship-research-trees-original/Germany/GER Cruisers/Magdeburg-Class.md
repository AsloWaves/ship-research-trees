**First German Light Cruisers with Waterline Belt Armor** - 4 ships built (1912-1913): Magdeburg, Breslau, Strassburg, Stralsund. **Revolutionary innovation**: First German light cruisers with waterline belt armor (60mm), significantly improving protection. Fastest to date (28.2 knots), first mixed coal/oil firing. **SMS Breslau**: Famous Mediterranean operations with battlecruiser SMS Goeben (1914-1918), escaped to Constantinople, transferred to Ottoman Turkey (became Midilli), sunk by mines (20 Jan 1918, 330 killed). **SMS Magdeburg**: Ran aground in fog (26 Aug 1914), codebooks captured by Russia, contributed to breaking German naval codes.

**Key Features:** FIRST waterline belt armor (60mm) | Breslau: Mediterranean escape with Goeben | Magdeburg: Codebooks captured (code-breaking) | 28.2 knots

**Ships:** SMS Magdeburg (grounded 26 Aug 1914, codebooks captured, scuttled), SMS Breslau (transferred Ottoman Turkey as Midilli, sunk by mines 20 Jan 1918, 330 killed), SMS Strassburg (survived WWI, scrapped 1920), SMS Stralsund (survived WWI, Italian war prize, scrapped 1943)

**Service:** WWI operations (1914-1918). Magdeburg: Grounded in fog (26 Aug 1914, Gulf of Finland), codebooks captured by Russia (contributed to British code-breaking), scuttled. Breslau: Mediterranean escape with Goeben (Aug 1914), transferred Ottoman Turkey (became Midilli), Black Sea operations, sunk by British mines (20 Jan 1918, 330 killed, 139 survivors). Strassburg and Stralsund: High Seas Fleet service, Battle of Jutland (1916), surrendered 1918. Magdeburg-class introduced waterline belt armor standard for all future German light cruisers.
