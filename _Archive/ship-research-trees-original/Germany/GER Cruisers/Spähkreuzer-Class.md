**Specialized Reconnaissance Cruiser (Paper Ship) - Never Built** - Theoretical scout cruiser design optimized for fleet reconnaissance and ocean scouting. 7,500 tons, 6× 15cm guns (3× twin turrets), **38 knots** (fastest German cruiser design). Maximum endurance (10,000 nm at 20 knots), minimal armor (50mm belt) for speed, advanced radar and reconnaissance equipment. Designed to scout ahead of battlefleet and heavy cruiser squadrons, locate enemy forces, shadow enemy formations. Design study only, never formally proposed. Would have filled reconnaissance role lost when armored/light cruiser distinction ended. Emphasized speed and range over protection.

**Key Features:** Specialized scout cruiser (38 knots, 10,000 nm range) | Minimal armor for speed (50mm belt) | Advanced reconnaissance equipment | Paper design only

**Ships:** None (design study only, never formally proposed for construction)

**Service:** Never built. Theoretical design study examining specialized reconnaissance cruiser for fleet operations. Proposed extreme speed (38 knots, fastest German cruiser design), maximum endurance (10,000 nm for extended ocean patrols), minimal armament/armor for displacement efficiency (6× 15cm guns, 50mm belt). Advanced radar and reconnaissance equipment: long-range surface search radar, air search radar, radio direction finding, catapult for 4× scout aircraft. Designed to scout ahead of battlefleet, locate enemy forces, shadow enemy formations without engagement. Would have complemented heavy cruiser operations by providing advance warning and intelligence. Never formally proposed, remained theoretical exercise exploring specialized cruiser roles. Speed and range priorities reflected emphasis on information gathering over combat capability.
