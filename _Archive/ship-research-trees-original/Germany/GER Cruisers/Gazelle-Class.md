**First Modern Light Cruiser Design (1901)** - 10 ships built (1901-1904), established worldwide light cruiser standard. 2,644 tons, 10× 10.5cm guns, 21.5 knots. Revolutionary watertight cellular construction, Schulz-Thornycroft water-tube boilers. Designed for High Seas Fleet scouting, not colonial service like predecessors. WWI service: SMS Frauenlob became first German cruiser sunk in WWI (Battle of Heligoland Bight, 28 Aug 1914, 320 killed). SMS Niobe transferred to Yugoslavia 1925, survived WWII as Dalmacija. Gazelle-class established design principles used throughout WWI.

**Key Features:** First modern light cruiser design (1901) | Watertight cellular construction | 10× 10.5cm SK L/40 guns | Frauenlob: First German cruiser lost in WWI

**Ships:** SMS Gazelle, SMS Niobe (transferred Yugoslavia 1925, survived WWII), SMS Nymph, SMS Thetis, SMS Ariadne (sunk Heligoland Bight 1914), SMS Amazone, SMS Medusa, SMS Frauenlob (sunk Heligoland Bight 28 Aug 1914, first German cruiser lost WWI), SMS Arcona, SMS Undine (torpedoed 1915)

**Service:** High Seas Fleet scouting (1901-1918). Battle of Heligoland Bight (28 Aug 1914): Frauenlob sunk by HMS Southampton (320 killed, 3 survivors), Ariadne sunk. SMS Undine torpedoed by British submarine E19 (1915). Most survived WWI, scrapped 1920s. Niobe: Transferred Yugoslavia 1925, became Dalmacija, captured Italy 1941, German 1943, Yugoslav 1945, scrapped 1949. Gazelle-class validated modern light cruiser concept.
