contemporary: Japanese carriers (Akagi, Kaga operational 1927-1928)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - COMPREHENSIVE JAPANESE CARRIER ANALYSIS! (1928!)
  - "Learning from Experts" special ability (+20% effectiveness, UNIQUE!)
  - Studied Akagi and Kaga designs (world's most advanced carriers!)
  - Secret naval ties maintained despite Versailles restrictions
  - Japanese carrier expertise informed later German designs
  - Analysis of successful carrier operations and doctrine
  - Flight deck configuration studies (three-deck vs. single-deck)
  - Influenced Graf Zeppelin design (+20% from expert knowledge)
  - STUDY ONLY! (no construction)

**Japanese Carrier Analysis - 1928 Expert Study!** - 0 boats: **LEARNING FROM EXPERTS!** Comprehensive analysis of Japanese carrier designs, particularly **Akagi** (36,500 tons, 60+ aircraft) and **Kaga** (38,200 tons, 60+ aircraft). Germany maintained **secret naval ties** despite Versailles restrictions, studying world's most advanced carrier programs. Research covered flight deck design, aircraft handling, carrier doctrine, and operations. This expert knowledge provided **+20% effectiveness** bonus and directly influenced later **Graf Zeppelin** design. **STUDY ONLY** - no construction, pure research program laying foundation for Plan Z carriers.
