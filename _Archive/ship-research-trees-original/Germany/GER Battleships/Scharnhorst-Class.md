# Innovation
firsts:
  - Fastest WWII battleships (31.5 knots, matched only by Richelieu/Iowa)
  - Thickest German WWII belt armor (350mm, exceeds Bismarck's 320mm)
  - Based on WWI Ersatz Yorck-class design (validated 1918 plans)
  - Channel Dash (most audacious German surface operation, Feb 1942)
  - Battle of North Cape (last European battleship duel, Dec 1943)
  - 28cm gun compromise (designed for 38cm, Hitler demanded rapid construction)

**Germany's Fast Battleships with Gun Compromise** - Based on WWI Ersatz Yorck design, built 1936-1939. 31.5 knots (fastest WWII battleships with Richelieu/Iowa), 350mm belt (thickest German WWII armor!). Armed with 9× 28cm guns (compromise—designed for 6× 38cm, Hitler demanded rapid construction). Sank HMS Glorious + escorts (8 Jun 1940, 1,207 killed). Operation Berlin (Jan-Mar 1941): 22 merchant ships sunk (115,622 GRT). Channel Dash (Feb 1942): Most audacious German operation, escaped Brest to Germany through English Channel (242 RAF bombers, 0 hits). Scharnhorst sunk Battle of North Cape (26 Dec 1943, last European battleship duel, 1,932 killed, 36 survivors = 1.8%). Gneisenau: Magazine explosion (Feb 1942), 80% complete with 38cm refit when Hitler canceled 1943, scuttled 1945.

**Key Features:** 31.5 knots (fastest WWII battleships) | 350mm belt (thickest German armor) | 28cm guns (compromise for 38cm) | Channel Dash success

**Ships:** Scharnhorst, Gneisenau

**Service:** Both sank HMS Glorious (8 Jun 1940). Operation Berlin (Jan-Mar 1941): 115,622 GRT sunk (combined). Channel Dash (11-13 Feb 1942): Escaped Brest, Gneisenau mined (minor), Scharnhorst mined twice. Gneisenau: Magazine explosion 26 Feb 1942, 38cm refit 80% complete when canceled 1943, scuttled Gotenhafen 27 Mar 1945. Scharnhorst: Battle of North Cape (26 Dec 1943), sunk by HMS Duke of York + destroyers (1,932 killed, 36 survivors, 1.8% survival rate).
