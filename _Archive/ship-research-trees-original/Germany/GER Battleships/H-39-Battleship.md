resource_diversion: All resources diverted to U-boats, tanks, aircraft!

# Construction History - ACTUALLY LAID DOWN!

# H-39 "H" (Ship 1)
h_laid_down: **LAID DOWN** July 15, 1939 (Blohm & Voss, Hamburg)
h_construction: Keel laid, construction started (slip 1)
h_progress: ~2% complete when cancelled (mostly steel plates prepared)
h_cancelled: **CANCELLED** September 1939 (WWII outbreak!)
h_scrapped: Slipway cleared, materials reused for U-boats

# H-39 "J" (Ship 2)
j_laid_down: **LAID DOWN** August 15, 1939 (AG Weser, Bremen)
j_construction: Keel laid, construction started (slip 2)
j_progress: ~2% complete when cancelled
j_cancelled: **CANCELLED** September 1939 (WWII outbreak!)
j_scrapped: Slipway cleared, materials reused for U-boats

# H-39 K, L, M, N (Ships 3-6)
remaining_ships: 4 more ships planned (K, L, M, N)
planned_yards: Blohm & Voss, Deutsche Werke, AG Weser
never_started: Construction never started (cancelled before keel laying)
plan_z_fantasy: Would have required 10+ years, massive resources

# Historical Significance

# Plan Z Ambition vs Reality
hitler_dream: Hitler dreamed of challenging Royal Navy by 1944-1948
plan_z_scope: Massive fleet expansion (10-year program)
bismarck_lesson: Bismarck's loss (1941) proved surface fleet futility
dönitz_argument: Admiral Dönitz argued for U-boat priority (proved correct!)
resources_wasted: Materials for 2 H-39s used for ~20-30 U-boats instead

# What If Completed?
hypothetical_power: Would have been most powerful German BBs (larger than Bismarck!)
hypothetical_combat: 40.6cm guns could engage any Allied BB
hypothetical_fate: Likely same as Bismarck/Tirpitz (sunk or bottled up)
fuel_shortage: Germany lacked fuel for capital ship operations (chronic shortage)
air_power: RAF/USAAF would have sunk them (Tirpitz example)

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Bismarck-Battleship]]"
successor: "[[H-41-Battleship]]" (improved H-class design)
contemporary: USS Iowa (1943 - 16" guns), HMS Vanguard (1946 - 15" guns)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - **PLAN Z SUPER BATTLESHIP!** (Hitler's dream fleet!)
  - **ACTUALLY LAID DOWN!** (2 ships, July-August 1939!)
  - 56,444 tons standard, 62,497 tons full load (LARGER than Bismarck!)
  - 6 ships planned (H, J, K, L, M, N)
  - 8× 40.6cm (16") guns in 4× twin turrets (BIGGER than Bismarck's 15"!)
  - 1,030 kg armor-piercing shells (+25% heavier than Bismarck!)
  - 30 knots maximum speed (165,000 shp turbines)
  - 9,300 nm range at 19 knots (estimated)
  - Improved armor: 320mm belt, 380mm turrets (thicker than Bismarck!)
  - Laid down July 15, 1939 ("H" at Blohm & Voss, Hamburg)
  - Laid down August 15, 1939 ("J" at AG Weser, Bremen)
  - ~2% complete when **CANCELLED** September 1939 (WWII outbreak!)
  - Plan Z program: 6× H-class BBs, 3× O-class BCs, 4× carriers, etc.
  - Plan Z timeline: 10-year program (1939-1949 planned completion)
  - Plan Z cost: 33 billion Reichsmarks (astronomical!)
  - **WWII REALITY**: All resources diverted to U-boats, tanks, aircraft!
  - Materials reused for ~20-30 U-boats instead of 2× H-39 BBs
  - Bismarck's loss (1941) proved surface fleet futility
  - Dönitz argued U-boat priority (proved correct!)
  - Would have been most powerful German BBs (if completed)
  - Likely fate: Same as Bismarck/Tirpitz (sunk or bottled up)
  - Germany lacked fuel for capital ship operations (chronic shortage)
  - Air power would have destroyed them (RAF/USAAF)
  - Plan Z: Hitler's fantasy vs WWII reality!
