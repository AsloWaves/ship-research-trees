**"Milchkuh" Tanker - 203 Tons Resupply Fuel!** - 10 boats commissioned 1941-1942: U-459 to U-464, U-487 to U-490. **SUBMARINE TANKER!** Nicknamed **"Milchkuh" (Milk Cow)**! 1688 tons surfaced, **203 TONS EXTRA FUEL** for resupplying other U-boats at sea! **"Milchkuh" special ability (+100% fleet endurance, UNIQUE!)**. **Extended patrol duration +100%+!** **30.8 ft beam** (WIDEST German submarine!). Minimal armament: 2× stern torpedo tubes (self-defense), NO deck gun (cargo space!). Carried 4 spare torpedoes + provisions + spare parts. Mid-Atlantic rendezvous operations. **Strategic force multiplier**. **ALL 10 BOATS LOST 1943-1944!** (100% loss rate!) Allied priority targets.

**Key Features:** MILCHKUH! (Milk Cow!) | 203 tons fuel resupply! | +100% fleet endurance (UNIQUE!) | 10 boats built | 30.8 ft beam (widest!) | Mid-Atlantic rendezvous | 4 spare torpedoes + provisions + parts | Strategic force multiplier | ALL 10 LOST! (100%!) | Allied priority targets

**Ships:** 10 boats (U-459 to U-490, commissioned 1941-1942, resupply operations, ALL lost in combat 1943-1944)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1941-1944). WWII service (1941-1944): **SUBMARINE TANKER!** Type XIV nicknamed **"Milchkuh" (Milk Cow)** - resupplied combat U-boats at sea like cows providing milk! Revolutionary concept extended U-boat operational range dramatically. **Strategic purpose**: Type VIIC (8,500 nm range) and Type IXC (11,000 nm range) combat U-boats could operate mid-Atlantic 2-3 months before needing to return to French bases for refueling. Type XIV "Milchkuh" tankers enabled **doubling or tripling patrol duration**! Combat U-boats rendezvoused with Milchkuh in mid-Atlantic, refueled, then continued hunting without returning to port. **203 tons extra fuel**: Type XIV carried **203 tons of diesel fuel** beyond own operational needs! Could fully refuel 12-15 Type VII U-boats OR 8-10 Type IX U-boats during single patrol. Massive fuel capacity achieved through: specialized internal fuel tanks replacing torpedo storage, enlarged saddle tanks, dedicated refueling compartments. **30.8 ft beam** (WIDEST German submarine!) accommodated huge fuel tanks. **Resupply capabilities**: Fuel: 203 tons diesel (primary mission). Torpedoes: 4× spare G7a/G7e torpedoes. Provisions: 4 weeks' food for resupplied boats. Spare parts: Engine components, batteries, equipment, medical supplies. Fresh water. Lubricating oil. **Mid-Atlantic operations**: Type XIV operated mid-Atlantic "milk cow grid squares" - designated rendezvous areas. Combat U-boats received encrypted radio orders: "Proceed to grid square XY, rendezvous Milchkuh U-459 at coordinates ABC." Dangerous operation - both submarines surfaced simultaneously for 4-8 hours fuel transfer. Vulnerable to aircraft/destroyer attack. Required calm seas. **Refueling procedure**: Type XIV surfaced at rendezvous point. Combat U-boat surfaced alongside (30-50 feet separation). Crews connected rubber fuel hoses between boats. Deck-mounted pumps transferred diesel fuel (4-8 hours for full refuel). Simultaneously transferred torpedoes (deck crane), provisions (hand-passed), spare parts. Both submarines submerged immediately if aircraft/ship detected. **"+100% fleet endurance"**: Type XIV force multiplier effect DOUBLED or TRIPLED effective U-boat fleet strength! Type VIIC normally operated 60-90 days before returning to base. With Milchkuh refueling: 120-180 days continuous operations! Meant Germany could maintain more U-boats on station with same number of boats. Type XIV strategic value enormous despite small numbers (10 boats). **Minimal combat capability**: Type XIV designed for resupply, not combat. Only 2× stern torpedo tubes (self-defense). 4 torpedoes total (minimal). NO deck gun (removed for cargo space!). Heavy AA armament late-war: 2× 3.7cm + 2× 2cm Flak (needed protection - high-value targets!). Avoided combat when possible. **Allied priority targets**: British/American intelligence quickly identified Type XIV strategic importance. Milchkuh became HIGHEST PRIORITY targets for Allied forces! Every Type XIV sunk meant dozens of combat U-boats forced to return to base prematurely (reduced time on station). **CATASTROPHIC LOSSES**: **ALL 10 Type XIV boats lost 1943-1944!** 100% loss rate! Allied forces specifically hunted Milchkuh boats: **U-459** sunk July 1943 (aircraft, Bay of Biscay). **U-460** sunk October 1943 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-461** sunk July 1943 (aircraft, Bay of Biscay). **U-462** sunk July 1943 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-463** sunk May 1943 (aircraft, Bay of Biscay). **U-464** sunk August 1942 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-487** sunk July 1943 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-488** sunk April 1944 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-489** sunk August 1943 (aircraft, Atlantic). **U-490** sunk June 1944 (destroyer, Atlantic - LAST Milchkuh!). Average lifespan: 12-18 months. **Strategic impact of losses**: Type XIV destruction 1943-1944 crippled U-boat operations. Combat U-boats forced to return to French bases more frequently. Reduced time on patrol station. Allied convoy system more effective as fewer U-boats could maintain positions. Germany attempted replacement with Type VIIF torpedo transports (4 boats), but inadequate fuel capacity. **Historical significance**: Type XIV represented **submarine force multiplier concept** - few supply boats enabling many combat boats. Proved resupply submarines strategic but EXTREMELY vulnerable. 100% loss rate showed Allied ASW priority targeting effectiveness. Once Allies identified strategic importance, Type XIV doomed. **Legacy**: Type XIV concept influenced post-war submarine tender operations - but using SURFACE tenders, not submarine resupply boats. Submarine-to-submarine refueling too dangerous. Modern submarine forces use surface support ships or forward bases. Type XIV proved strategic resupply submarines non-viable in contested waters. But "Milchkuh" nickname entered naval history as symbol of innovative submarine logistics!
