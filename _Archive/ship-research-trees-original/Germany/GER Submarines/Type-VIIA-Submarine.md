**First Production Type VII - Established the Standard** - 10 boats commissioned 1936: U-27 to U-36. **FIRST PRODUCTION TYPE VII!** Established Type VII standard that led to 709 boats total (most numerous submarine class ever!). 626 tons surfaced, **5× 53.3cm torpedo tubes** (4 bow, 1 stern), **11-14 torpedoes carried**, 17.0 knots surfaced/8.0 knots submerged. **6,200 nm range** (Atlantic capable), **1× 8.8cm SK C/35** + 1× 2cm Flak. **Saddle tank design** (Type VII signature!). All 10 boats lost in combat 1940-1941. Established template for VIIB (24 boats) and **VIIC (577-593 boats - THE workhorse!)**.

**Key Features:** First production Type VII! | 10 boats (U-27 to U-36) | Established Type VII standard (709 total!) | 626 tons (medium) | 5 torpedo tubes | Saddle tank design (signature!) | 6,200 nm Atlantic range | Led to most numerous class | All lost 1940-1941

**Ships:** 10 boats (U-27 to U-36, commissioned 1936, early WWII operations, all lost in combat 1940-1941)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1936-1941). Interwar/WWII service (1936-1941): **FIRST PRODUCTION TYPE VII!** Type VIIA established design template for most successful submarine class in history. 10 boats built 1936 validated Type VII concept before mass production. Led to 709 Type VII boats total (VIIA: 10, VIIB: 24, VIIC: 577-593, VIID: 6, VIIF: 4). **Type VII design philosophy**: Medium-sized attack submarine optimized for North Atlantic operations. Balanced size, range, armament, and diving depth. 626 tons surfaced (between coastal Type II 250-300 tons and ocean-going Type IX 1,000+ tons). Not too large, not too small - "Goldilocks" optimal size. **Saddle tank innovation**: Type VII signature feature - saddle tanks wrapped around pressure hull. Increased fuel capacity without enlarging pressure hull diameter. Enabled 6,200 nm range from relatively compact design. Faster diving than conventional external tanks. All subsequent Type VII variants used saddle tank design. **Combat armament**: 5× 53.3cm torpedo tubes (4 bow, 1 stern). 11 torpedoes initially, increased to 14 torpedoes after experience. 8.8cm SK C/35 deck gun for surface attacks on unarmed merchants (conserved torpedoes). 2cm Flak for anti-aircraft defense. **Early WWII operations**: Type VIIA participated in opening months WWII (September 1939-1941). Atlantic convoy attacks, Norwegian campaign (April 1940), Mediterranean operations. U-30 (VIIA) fired first shots of WWII Atlantic battle - sank passenger liner Athenia 3 September 1939 (mistake, 128 killed, international outrage). **Combat effectiveness**: Despite small numbers (10 boats), Type VIIA proved highly effective. Validated wolf pack tactics (Rudeltaktik). Demonstrated Type VII could threaten British supply lines. Range adequate for mid-Atlantic operations. **Total loss**: All 10 Type VIIA boats lost in combat 1940-1941! U-27 sunk September 1939 (depth charge). U-31 sunk March 1940 (torpedo). U-33 sunk February 1940 (minesweeper). No survivors at war's end. Average service life <2 years. Heavy losses reflected dangerous early-war operations before tactics optimized. **Historical significance**: **Established Type VII standard** - proved medium-sized attack submarine concept viable. Type VIIA lessons directly influenced VIIB (1939, 24 boats) and **VIIC (1941-1945, 577-593 boats - most produced submarine variant EVER!)**. Without Type VIIA validation, mass Type VII production might not have occurred. **Legacy**: Type VIIA's 10 boats led to 709 Type VII boats total. Type VII formed backbone of Battle of Atlantic (1939-1945). Most famous U-boats were Type VII: U-47 (Prien, Scapa Flow), U-96 (Das Boot), U-99 (Kretschmer), U-48 (most successful). Type VIIA established template for legendary U-boat force.
