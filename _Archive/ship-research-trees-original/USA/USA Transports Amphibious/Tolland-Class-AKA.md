**Larger Cargo Capacity** - Tolland-class attack cargo ships based on C2-S-AJ3 hull with greater capacity than Artemis-class. 32 ships (1 cancelled). Many present at Tokyo Bay surrender.

**Key Specs:** 8,635/13,910 tons | 459ft | 16.5 kn | 4,450 DWT cargo | 32 ships

**Design:** Based on C2-S-AJ3 Maritime Commission design, significantly larger than Artemis-class shallow-draft AKAs. Single-screw configuration with 6,000 SHP geared turbine. Carried 8 LCM(3), 15-16 LCVPs, and 1 LCP(L) for cargo transfer operations. Built in two series with different completion methods.

**Ships (select):** USS Tolland (AKA-64), USS Shoshone (AKA-65), USS Southampton (AKA-66), USS Starr (AKA-67), USS Stokes (AKA-68), and 27 others. Ships AKA-64 through AKA-87 and AKA-101 through AKA-108. USS San Joaquin (AKA-109) cancelled August 27, 1945. All named for US counties.

**Service:** Commissioned 1944-1945 for Pacific operations. Nine Tolland-class AKAs present at Tokyo Bay surrender ceremony (September 2, 1945). Many converted to LKA (Amphibious Cargo Ship) designation for Korean/Vietnam service. 70 of 108 total AKAs in US inventory decommissioned within one year of war's end.

**Construction:** Built by North Carolina Shipbuilding Company, Wilmington, North Carolina. Ships AKA-64-75 and AKA-101-104 completed at Charleston Navy Yard. Ships AKA-76-87 and AKA-105-108 towed to New York/Baltimore for completion. Two different completion methods reflected wartime production pressures.

**Legacy:** Larger cargo capacity than Artemis-class made these valuable logistics ships. Many served 20+ years including Korean and Vietnam wars. Some redesignated LKA for Cold War amphibious operations. Represented peak of WWII attack cargo ship development.
