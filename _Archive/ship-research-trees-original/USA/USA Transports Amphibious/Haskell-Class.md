**Most Numerous Attack Transports** - Haskell-class were most numerous attack transport class ever. 117 ships built 1944-1945. Converted Victory cargo ships. Backbone of Pacific amphibious operations 1945.

**Key Specs:** 12,450/14,000 tons | 455ft | 17.7/18 kn | 1,500+ troops | 3 LCVP + 15 LCM + 10 LCP | 117 ships

**Innovation:** Mass production attack transports converted from Victory ship hulls. Rapid conversion (90-120 days). Standardized design allowed quick production. Carried troops, landing craft, vehicles, supplies for amphibious assaults.

**Design:** Victory ship hull with transport modifications. Troop berthing for 1,500+ Marines. Davits for 3 LCVP (Higgins boats). Cargo booms for 15 LCM landing craft and 10 LCP(L). Vehicle holds. Defensive armament (5-inch gun, 40mm, 20mm AA).

**Conversion:** Based on VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design. Transport conversions done at various US shipyards. Troop accommodations installed. Landing craft davits and booms. Military communications and command facilities. Medical facilities.

**Landing Craft Carried:**
- 3× LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) - Higgins boats
- 15× LCM (Landing Craft, Mechanized) - tank lighters
- 10× LCP(L) (Landing Craft, Personnel, Large)

**Service:**
- **Iwo Jima (February 1945):** Many Haskells participated
- **Okinawa (April 1945):** Largest amphibious assault, numerous Haskells
- **Occupation of Japan (1945-1946):** Troop transport
- **Korean War (1950-1953):** Reactivated for Inchon and operations
- **Vietnam War (1965-1975):** Some served as troop transports
- **Postwar:** Many served in reserve fleets, some until 1970s

**Production Numbers:** 117 ships commissioned 1944-1945, making Haskell-class the largest attack transport class in history. Emergency wartime production to support Pacific island-hopping campaign.

**Example Ships:**
- **Haskell (APA-117)** - Name ship
- **Bayfield (APA-33)** - Different class but similar
- Many named after counties (standard APA naming convention)

**Legacy:** Proved mass production transport concept. Carried hundreds of thousands of troops in Pacific. Critical to island-hopping strategy. Many served decades after WWII in Korea and Vietnam.
