**Nuclear Backbone** - Nimitz-class are backbone of US carrier force. 10 ships commissioned 1975-2009. Two A4W reactors vs Enterprise's eight. 100,000+ tons. All currently active.

**Key Specs:** 97,000/106,300 tons | 1,092ft | 30+ kn | 90 aircraft | 2× A4W reactors | Unlimited range | 10 ships active

**Innovation:** Two nuclear reactors vs eight on Enterprise (simpler, more efficient). Standardized design - 10 ships built over 34 years. 100,000+ ton displacement. 50-year service life. Core refueling at 25 years.

**Design:** Two Westinghouse A4W reactors (260,000 shp). Four steam catapults. Four deck-edge elevators. Angled deck. Island on starboard. CIWS and missile self-defense. Can carry 90+ aircraft (130 surge).

**Ships (CVN-68 to CVN-77):**
- Nimitz, Eisenhower, Vinson, Roosevelt, Lincoln, Washington, Stennis, Truman, Reagan, G.H.W. Bush

**Flights:** Improved through three flights (I, II, III) with upgrades to radars, self-defense, systems.

**Service:** Persian Gulf 1991. Bosnia. Afghanistan 2001-present. Iraq 2003-2011. Libya 2011. ISIS 2014-present. Continuous forward presence worldwide. 30+ years average service per ship.

**Status:** All 10 ships active as of 2024. Being gradually replaced by Ford-class starting 2024-2040s. Most proven nuclear carrier design.
