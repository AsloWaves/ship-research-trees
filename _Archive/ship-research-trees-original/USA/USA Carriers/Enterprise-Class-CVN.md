**First Nuclear Carrier** - Enterprise (CVN-65) was world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Commissioned 1961. Eight A2W reactors. Served 51 years - longest carrier service.

**Key Specs:** 75,700/93,500 tons | 1,123ft | 33+ kn | 90 aircraft | 8× A2W reactors | Unlimited range | First nuclear carrier

**Innovation:** First nuclear-powered surface warship. Eight Westinghouse A2W reactors (280,000 shp). Unlimited range at high speed. No funnel - distinctive square island with phased-array radars. 51 years service - longest-serving carrier.

**Design:** Eight nuclear reactors (later carriers use two). No uptakes for boiler exhaust - more hangar space. Distinctive square island with SCANFAR radars. Four steam catapults. Four deck-edge elevators.

**Service:** Cuba Missile Crisis 1962. Vietnam War (6 deployments, 132,000 sorties). Libya operations 1986. Desert Storm 1991. Afghanistan 2001. Iraq 2003-2011. 25 deployments. Over 400,000 arrested landings. Decommissioned December 2017 after 51 years.

**Legacy:** "Big E" proved nuclear propulsion for carriers. 20+ knots sustained for weeks without refueling. High sustained speed revolutionized carrier operations. Paved way for Nimitz and Ford classes.
