**Next-Generation SSBNs** - Columbia-class will replace Ohio-class SSBNs. 12 boats planned. First boat Columbia (SSBN-826) under construction. Advanced design with life-of-ship reactor.

**Key Specs:** 18700/20810 tons | 560ft | 20+/25+ kn | 16× Trident II D5LE SLBMs | Life-of-ship reactor | Pump-jet | 12 boats planned

**Innovation:** Life-of-ship reactor core (42-year service, no refueling). Electric drive. Advanced quieting. X-stern control surfaces. 16 missile tubes (vs 24 on Ohio) but maintains same deterrent capability with D5LE missiles.

**Design:** Larger diameter than Ohio. Common Missile Compartment with UK Dreadnought-class. Quieter than Ohio. Advanced automation reduces crew size.

**Program:** Lead boat Columbia (SSBN-826) started construction 2021, launch planned 2027-2028, commission 2031. 12 boats will replace 14 Ohio-class SSBNs. Production through 2040s. Cost: ~$130B for 12 boats.
