**Modern Conventional Design** - First post-WWII designed destroyers with advanced 5-inch/54 guns and high-pressure steam. Highly modified during service.

**Game Changers:**
- 🎯 **5-inch/54 Mark 42** - 40 rpm automatic, 25,909 yd range (vs 5"/38)
- 🔥 **1200 psi Boilers** - Highest pressure yet (vs 600 psi)
- ⚡ **70,000 shp** - +10,000 over Gearing
- 🔄 **Extensive Conversions** - Many modified to DDG or ASROC configs

**vs [[Gearing-Class]]:** +375t | +28 ft length | 5"/38→**5"/54** | +10,000 shp | Higher pressure steam

**5-inch/54 Mark 42 Performance:**
- Rate of Fire: 40 rpm (designed), 28 rpm (later downrated)
- Range: 25,909 yds @ 47° / 48,700 ft ceiling @ 85°
- Projectile: 70-lb, Muzzle velocity: 2,650 fps
- Magazine: 599 rounds per mount

**Major Modifications:**
- **ASROC Mod (SCB 251):** 8 ships - ASROC launcher replaced No. 2 5"/54 gun
- **DDG Conversion (SCB 240):** 4 ships (DDG-31 to DDG-34)
  - Mk-13 Tartar/Standard missile launcher (40 rounds)
  - 1× 5"/54 gun (forward only)
  - ASROC launcher
  - Harpoon anti-ship missiles (later)

**Legacy:** Last all-gun destroyers designed, transitioned fleet to missile era
