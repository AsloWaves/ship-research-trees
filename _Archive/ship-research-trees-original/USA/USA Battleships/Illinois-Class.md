**Last Fire-Tube Boilers** - Illinois-class were last US battleships with fire-tube boilers. 2 ships. Improved Kearsarge without superimposed turrets.

**Key Specs:** 11,565/12,250 tons | 374ft | 16 kn | 4× 13" + 14× 6" guns | 16.5" belt | 2 ships

**Design:** Conventional turret layout (abandoned Kearsarge superimposed design). Similar armament but 6-inch secondary battery instead of 8-inch.
