**Triple Turrets** - Pennsylvania-class were first US battleships with triple gun turrets, mounting 12× 14-inch guns in four turrets. 2 ships. Arizona lost at Pearl Harbor.

**Key Specs:** 31,400/33,100 tons | 608ft | 21 kn | 12× 14"/45 (4 triple turrets) | 13.5" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First US battleships with triple gun turrets, increasing firepower to 12 guns while reducing number of turrets from five to four. First US battleships designed from start for oil fuel only (no coal). More compact arrangement improved protection and efficiency. Heavier armor than New York-class with 13.5-inch belt.

**Ships:**
- **Pennsylvania (BB-38)** - Commissioned June 12, 1916, damaged at Pearl Harbor (in drydock), repaired and modernized, served entire Pacific War, decommissioned Aug 29, 1946, sunk as target Feb 10, 1948
- **Arizona (BB-39)** - Commissioned Oct 17, 1916, sunk at Pearl Harbor Dec 7, 1941, remains USS Arizona Memorial

**Service:** WWI operations. Arizona sunk by Japanese attack Dec 7, 1941 with loss of 1,177 crew, remains as memorial. Pennsylvania in drydock during Pearl Harbor attack, sustained moderate damage, extensively repaired and modernized 1942-1943. Served entire Pacific War providing gunfire support at Aleutians, Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Marianas, Palau, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Torpedoed by Japanese aircraft at Okinawa Aug 12, 1945 but survived.

**Design:** Four triple 14-inch turrets (2 forward superfiring, 2 aft superfiring). Curtis direct-drive turbines. Eight oil-fired boilers. Cage masts replaced by tripod masts during modernizations. Pennsylvania received most extensive modernization after Pearl Harbor damage.

**Legacy:** Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor one of most visited war memorials. Pennsylvania demonstrated survivability of class, serving through entire Pacific campaign. Triple turret arrangement became standard for subsequent US battleships through Iowa-class.
