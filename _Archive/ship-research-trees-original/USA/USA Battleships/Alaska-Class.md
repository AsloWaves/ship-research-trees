**Battlecruisers / Large Cruisers** - Alaska-class were unique "large cruisers" with 12-inch guns. 2 built (4 cancelled). Fast (33 kn) with battleship-caliber guns but cruiser armor. Designed to counter Japanese heavy cruisers and commerce raiders.

**Key Specs:** 27,000/34,253 tons | 808ft | 33 kn | 9× 12" + 12× 5"/38 DP | 9" belt | Battlecruiser concept | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Unique design between heavy cruiser and battleship. Nine 12-inch/50 cal guns in three triple turrets - caliber between heavy cruiser (8-inch) and battleship (16-inch). Fast as cruiser (33 knots) but firepower approaching battleship.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Concept:** Battlecruiser - battleship guns, cruiser speed, light armor
- **Mission:** Counter Japanese "super cruisers" and commerce raiders
- **Reality:** Mission became obsolete as war progressed

**Design:** Three triple 12-inch turrets. Heavy AA armament. Cruiser-level armor (9-inch belt) vs battleship (12+ inches). Four-shaft turbines for 33 knots. Large size (808 ft, 34,000 tons full load).

**Ships:**
- **Alaska (CB-1)** - Commissioned June 1944, decommissioned February 1947
- **Guam (CB-2)** - Commissioned September 1944, decommissioned February 1947
- **Hawaii (CB-3)** - 82% complete, cancelled 1947, scrapped on slipway
- **Philippines (CB-4)** - Cancelled 1943, construction suspended
- **Puerto Rico (CB-5)** - Cancelled 1943
- **Samoa (CB-6)** - Cancelled 1943

**Service History:**
- **Alaska:** Pacific 1945, supported Okinawa, fire support
- **Guam:** Pacific 1945, supported Okinawa and operations
- **Limited combat:** War nearly over when commissioned
- **Peacetime:** Obsolete concept, expensive to operate
- **Decommissioned 1947:** Less than 3 years service

**Why Built:**
- **Intelligence reports:** Japanese building "super cruisers" (exaggerated)
- **Commerce raiding:** Counter German battlecruisers/raiders (Atlantic)
- **Force projection:** Heavy gun support without full battleship
- **Actually:** Mission became irrelevant

**Why So Few:**
- **Obsolete concept:** Carriers made battlecruisers obsolete
- **Expensive:** Cost nearly as much as battleship
- **Limited utility:** Not fast enough for carrier task forces
- **Wrong mission:** "Super cruisers" they were designed to counter didn't exist

**Comparison to Other Ships:**
| Type | Example | Guns | Armor | Speed |
|------|---------|------|-------|-------|
| Heavy Cruiser | Baltimore | 9× 8" | 6" belt | 33 kn |
| Alaska "Large Cruiser" | Alaska | 9× 12" | 9" belt | 33 kn |
| Battleship | Iowa | 9× 16" | 12" belt | 33 kn |
| Battleship | South Dakota | 9× 16" | 12" belt | 27 kn |

**Classification Debate:**
- **Official:** "Large Cruiser" (CB)
- **Effectively:** Battlecruiser (fast, big guns, light armor)
- **Size:** Between cruiser and battleship
- **Role:** Hybrid that fit no clear mission

**Legacy:**
- Last US battlecruiser-type ships
- Unique 12-inch gun caliber never repeated
- Proved battlecruiser concept obsolete in carrier age
- Short service life (< 3 years)
- Both preserved as memorials until scrapped 1960s
- Interesting evolutionary dead-end

**Why Cancelled (CB-3 to CB-6):**
- **Midway:** Proved carriers decisive
- **Cost:** $74M each vs $100M for Iowa battleship
- **Utility:** Limited usefulness
- **Resources:** Shipyard capacity needed for carriers and escorts
