# Revenge-Class Battleships (1916)

## Overview
The Revenge-class (also called Royal Sovereign-class) were slower, cheaper sisters to the Queen Elizabeth-class, sacrificing speed (21 vs 24 knots) for lower cost and simpler machinery. Armed with the same 8× 15-inch guns, all five served in WWI (two at Jutland) and WWII. HMS Royal Oak was torpedoed at anchor in Scapa Flow by U-47 in 1939, one of the most daring submarine attacks in history.

## Design Features

**Economy Design:**
- Cheaper alternative to Queen Elizabeth-class
- Slower speed (21 vs 24 knots) = less engine power needed (40,000 vs 75,000 shp)
- Simpler machinery = lower cost and easier maintenance
- Same armament (8× 15-inch guns)
- Same armor protection

**Main Armament:**
- BL 15-inch/42 Mk I (same as Queen Elizabeth and Hood)
- 4 twin turrets (2 forward, 2 aft superfiring)
- Same excellent 15-inch gun performance

**Philosophy:**
- "R-class": cheaper, slower battleships for battle line
- Queen Elizabeth-class: fast wing for fleet operations
- Both used same powerful 15-inch gun

## Service History

### World War I

**Battle of Jutland (31 May 1916):**
- Revenge and Royal Oak participated
- Royal Sovereign missed battle (engine problems)
- Limited engagement, no major damage
- Resolution, Ramillies completed after Jutland

**Grand Fleet Service:**
- All five served with Grand Fleet 1916-1918
- North Sea patrols
- No major fleet actions after Jutland

### Interwar Period

**Limited Modernization:**
- Less extensive than Queen Elizabeth-class
- AA guns upgraded
- Fire control modernized
- Bulges added for torpedo protection

### World War II

**Scapa Flow Raid (14 October 1939):**

HMS Royal Oak sunk in most daring submarine attack of WWII:
- **Location:** Scapa Flow anchorage (Royal Navy main base)
- **Attacker:** U-47 (Kapitänleutnant Günther Prien)
- **Method:** U-47 penetrated Scapa Flow defenses at night through Kirk Sound
- **Attack:** 3 torpedoes hit Royal Oak
- **Result:** Royal Oak capsized in 13 minutes, 835 crew killed (including Rear Admiral Blagrove)
- **Impact:** Shocked Britain - "impregnable" Scapa Flow penetrated

**Major WWII Operations:**
- **Atlantic Patrols:** Convoy escort, hunting German raiders
- **Force H:** Mediterranean operations
- **Normandy (1944):** Revenge, Ramillies bombarded beaches
- **Eastern Fleet:** Resolution served against Japan
- **Kamikaze Attack:** Ramillies damaged by kamikaze (1945, survived)

**Royal Sovereign to Soviet Navy:**
- Lent to Soviet Navy 1944 (compensation for Italian ships)
- Renamed *Arkhangelsk*
- Operated in Arctic 1944-1949
- Returned to RN 1949 in poor condition
- Scrapped immediately

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful economy design
- Traded speed for lower cost
- Effective battleships for battle line
- Less glamorous than Queen Elizabeth-class but equally useful

**Combat Record:**
- Royal Oak: Sunk at Scapa Flow (1939)
- Four survivors: Extensive WWII service
- All worn out by 1945, scrapped 1949

**Comparison to Queen Elizabeth:**
- Same guns, same armor
- 3 knots slower (21 vs 24)
- £500,000 cheaper per ship
- Simpler, more reliable machinery
