# N3 Battleship (Cancelled 1922)

## Overview
The N3 class was a dreadnought battleship class designed for the Royal Navy after World War I, similar in concept to the G3-class battlecruiser but optimized for maximum firepower and protection at the expense of speed. The class was designed to carry nine 18-inch guns - the largest naval guns ever planned for the Royal Navy. Four N3 battleships were planned but were never ordered due to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited battleship displacement to 35,000 tons and maximum gun caliber to 16 inches.

## Design

### Revolutionary Firepower

The N3 design's most revolutionary feature was its main armament of **nine 18-inch (457mm) guns** - the largest naval guns ever planned for the Royal Navy. This gave the N3 several distinctions:

1. **Most powerful battleship design of the era** - 18-inch guns larger than any other navy's
2. **Only British 18-inch gun design** - No other RN ship ever designed with 18-inch guns
3. **Maximum firepower** - Each 18-inch shell weighed ~3,320 pounds vs 2,375 pounds for 16-inch

### Main Armament: 18-inch Guns

The 18-inch/45 caliber Mark I gun was designed specifically for the N3 class:

**Specifications:**
- **Caliber:** 18 inches (457mm)
- **Shell weight:** 3,320 pounds (1,506 kg)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 2,500 ft/s (762 m/s)
- **Maximum range:** 40,000+ yards (36,600 m)
- **Rate of fire:** 2 rounds per minute
- **Turret arrangement:** 3 triple turrets, all forward

**Gun Layout:**
Similar to the G3 battlecruiser design, all three 18-inch triple turrets were mounted forward of the superstructure:
- Two turrets superfiring forward
- One turret aft of superstructure, also forward-facing

### Armor Protection

The N3 design featured even heavier armor than the G3 battlecruiser:

- **Belt armor:** 15 inches (vs 14" on G3)
- **Deck armor:** 8 inches (horizontal protection)
- **Turret face:** 18 inches (vs 17" on G3)
- **Barbettes:** 15 inches
- **Conning tower:** 14 inches

This armor scheme was designed to resist 18-inch shells at battle ranges, making the N3 extremely well-protected.

### Propulsion and Speed

Unlike the high-speed G3 battlecruiser (32 knots), the N3 was designed as a slower battleship:

- **Powerplant:** 4-shaft geared steam turbines
- **Power:** 56,000 shp (vs 160,000 shp on G3)
- **Speed:** 23 knots (vs 32 knots on G3)
- **Fuel capacity:** 5,000 tons oil
- **Range:** 7,000 nautical miles at 16 knots

The lower speed was acceptable because the N3's role was as a heavily-armed and armored battleship, not a fast battlecruiser.

## Development History

### Background and Requirements

Following World War I, the Royal Navy analyzed future battleship requirements and concluded that:

1. **Gun caliber:** Larger than 16-inch needed to maintain superiority
2. **Protection:** Must resist shells from foreign 16-18 inch guns
3. **Speed:** 23 knots sufficient for battle line operations
4. **Range:** 7,000 nautical miles for global operations

### Design Process (1921-1922)

The N3 design was developed in parallel with the G3 battlecruiser in 1921-1922 by the Director of Naval Construction's office. The design philosophy was:

**G3 battlecruiser:**
- High speed (32 knots)
- 16-inch guns
- Moderate armor

**N3 battleship:**
- Moderate speed (23 knots)
- 18-inch guns (most powerful)
- Heavy armor

### 18-Inch Gun Development

The 18-inch/45 caliber Mark I gun was designed but never built. Preliminary specifications were:

- **Length:** 67.5 feet (20.6 m)
- **Weight:** ~150 tons per gun
- **Shell types:** AP, HE, practice
- **Penetration:** ~18 inches of armor at 20,000 yards

The gun would have been the most powerful naval gun ever mounted on a British warship.

### Washington Naval Treaty

The N3 battleships were **never formally ordered** because the Washington Naval Conference began in November 1921, shortly after the design was completed. The **Washington Naval Treaty** (signed 6 February 1922) imposed limits that made the N3 impossible:

**Treaty Limits:**
- **Maximum displacement:** 35,000 tons (N3 was 48,500 tons)
- **Maximum gun caliber:** 16 inches (N3 had 18-inch guns)
- **Capital ship holiday:** No new battleships for 10 years

### Cancellation

The N3 design was **abandoned in 1922** without any ships being ordered. The Royal Navy was permitted to build two new battleships under the Washington Treaty, which became the **Nelson-class** with:
- Displacement: 33,950 tons (treaty-compliant)
- Armament: 9× 16-inch guns (treaty limit)
- Speed: 23 knots (same as N3)

## Comparison to Other Designs

### N3 vs G3 (Companion Design)

| Characteristic | N3 Battleship | G3 Battlecruiser |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Displacement | 48,500 tons | 48,400 tons |
| Speed | 23 knots | 32 knots |
| Main guns | 9× 18-inch | 9× 16-inch |
| Belt armor | 15 inches | 14 inches |
| Turret armor | 18 inches | 14-17 inches |
| Role | Battle line | Fast wing |

**Philosophy:** N3 traded speed for firepower and protection, while G3 emphasized speed.

### N3 vs Nelson (Treaty Derivative)

| Characteristic | N3 | Nelson |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Displacement | 48,500 tons | 33,950 tons |
| Speed | 23 knots | 23 knots |
| Main guns | 9× 18-inch | 9× 16-inch |
| Belt armor | 15 inches | 14 inches |
| Gun arrangement | 3 triple forward | 3 triple forward |
| Status | Cancelled | Built (2 ships) |

The Nelson-class was essentially a treaty-compliant N3 with smaller guns and reduced displacement.

### N3 vs Foreign Designs

**vs Colorado-class (USA):**
- N3: 9× 18-inch, 23 knots, 15" belt, 48,500 tons
- Colorado: 8× 16-inch, 21 knots, 13.5" belt, 32,600 tons
- **Advantage:** N3 superior in all respects

**vs Nagato-class (Japan):**
- N3: 9× 18-inch, 23 knots, 15" belt, 48,500 tons
- Nagato: 8× 16-inch, 26.5 knots, 12" belt, 33,800 tons
- **Advantage:** N3 more heavily armed and armored, Nagato faster

**vs South Dakota-class 1920 (USA, cancelled):**
- N3: 9× 18-inch, 23 knots, 15" belt, 48,500 tons
- South Dakota: 12× 16-inch, 23 knots, 13.5" belt, 43,200 tons
- **Advantage:** N3 had larger guns, South Dakota had more guns

## Legacy and Impact

### Nelson-Class Battleships

The N3 design directly influenced the Nelson-class battleships:

**N3 Features Retained in Nelson:**
- 9× main guns in triple turrets
- All turrets forward of superstructure
- 23-knot speed
- Heavy armor protection
- All-or-nothing armor scheme

**Changes for Treaty Compliance:**
- Reduced guns: 18-inch → 16-inch (treaty limit)
- Reduced displacement: 48,500 → 33,950 tons
- Reduced armor: Slightly thinner to save weight

### 18-Inch Gun Development

The N3's planned 18-inch guns represented the peak of British naval gun development:

**Comparison of Gun Calibers:**
- **15-inch:** Queen Elizabeth-class, Hood
- **16-inch:** Nelson-class (treaty limit), G3 (cancelled)
- **18-inch:** N3 only (never built)

**No British Warship Ever Mounted 18-Inch Guns:**
The N3 remains the only British design to feature 18-inch guns. After the Washington Treaty, 16 inches became the maximum caliber.

### International Influence

The N3 design contributed to international naval competition:

1. **Prompted Washington Treaty:** Designs like N3 and G3 showed naval arms race was unsustainable
2. **Influenced Japan:** Japanese 18-inch gun designs (Yamato-class, later)
3. **Established maximum caliber:** Washington Treaty 16-inch limit became standard

### Alternative History

If the N3 had been built and the Washington Treaty never signed, the 1920s-1930s would have seen:

- British N3 battleships with 18-inch guns
- US battleships with up to 18-inch guns (some US designs proposed)
- Japanese battleships with 18-inch guns (eventually led to Yamato with 18.1-inch)
- Massive naval arms race

## Technical Details

### Gun Arrangement

The all-forward turret arrangement offered:

**Advantages:**
- Concentrated firepower
- Better protection (magazines forward, machinery aft)
- Simplified armor distribution
- Reduced citadel length

**Disadvantages:**
- Poor stern fire
- Limited aft defense
- High metacentric height (stability issues)

### Fire Control

Planned fire control systems:
- 41-foot rangefinder in director control tower
- 15-foot rangefinders in each turret
- Mechanical fire control computers
- Centralized director control

### Armor Scheme

The N3 used an "all-or-nothing" armor scheme similar to G3:

**Heavily Armored:**
- Magazines: 15" belt + 8" deck
- Machinery: 15" belt + 8" deck
- Turrets: 18" face
- Barbettes: 15"

**Lightly or Unarmored:**
- Bow and stern
- Upper works
- Areas outside citadel

## Planned Ships

Four N3 battleships were planned but never ordered:

| Ship | Builder | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **N3-1** | Not assigned | Design only, never ordered |
| **N3-2** | Not assigned | Design only, never ordered |
| **N3-3** | Not assigned | Design only, never ordered |
| **N3-4** | Not assigned | Design only, never ordered |

Names were never assigned. Possible names based on RN traditions:
- Royal Sovereign
- Royal Oak
- Revenge
- Resolution

## What If: N3 in Service

### Hypothetical Capabilities (1920s-1930s)

If N3 battleships had been built:

1. **Most powerful battleships afloat** (1924-1940)
2. **18-inch guns** outranged and outpenetrated all foreign battleships
3. **Heavy armor** could resist 16-inch shells at battle ranges
4. **Battle line dominance** in North Sea or Mediterranean

### Hypothetical WWII Service

If N3 battleships had served in WWII:

**Advantages:**
- 18-inch guns more powerful than any Axis battleship except Yamato
- Heavy armor resistant to German and Italian guns
- Could have dominated Mediterranean and Atlantic

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow speed (23 knots) vs fast battleships (28-30 knots)
- Would have been 20 years old by 1940
- Expensive to modernize
- Large size (820 ft) difficult to dock

**Probable Service:**
- Home Fleet (North Sea)
- Atlantic convoy escort (if modernized)
- Mediterranean (Malta convoys)
- Would have outclassed Bismarck, Tirpitz, Littorio-class

### Comparison to Yamato

The N3's 18-inch guns foreshadowed Japan's Yamato-class (1941):

| Ship | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Status |
|------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **N3** | UK | 1922 (cancelled) | 48,500 tons | 23 kn | 9× 18\" | Cancelled |
| **Yamato** | Japan | 1941 | 64,000 tons | 27 kn | 9× 18.1\" | Built (2 ships) |

Yamato was larger and faster, but carried essentially the same armament concept as N3.

## Conclusion

The N3 battleship represented the ultimate British battleship design: maximum firepower (18-inch guns), maximum protection (15-inch belt), and sufficient speed (23 knots) for battle line operations. The design was abandoned due to the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited gun caliber to 16 inches.

The N3 remains significant as:
- The only British battleship design with 18-inch guns
- One of the most powerful battleship designs of the 1920s
- Direct predecessor to the Nelson-class
- Proof of British willingness to build extremely powerful ships

No British warship ever carried 18-inch guns, making the N3 a "what if" design of considerable interest.
