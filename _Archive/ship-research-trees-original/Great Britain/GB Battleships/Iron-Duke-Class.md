# Iron Duke-Class Battleships (1914)

## Overview
The Iron Duke-class were improved Orion-class super-dreadnoughts, retaining 10× 13.5-inch guns but with enhanced secondary armament and protection. Four ships commissioned 1914: HMS Iron Duke (Grand Fleet flagship), Marlborough, Benbow, and Emperor of India. HMS Iron Duke served as Admiral Jellicoe's flagship at Battle of Jutland (1916), commanding entire British Grand Fleet. All four participated at Jutland with HMS Marlborough torpedoed but survived. Under London Naval Treaty, three scrapped 1931-1932; HMS Iron Duke demilitarized and served as depot ship until bombed 1939, scrapped 1946.

**Grand Fleet Command Center:**
- Jellicoe commanded from Iron Duke 1914-1917
- All Grand Fleet operations directed from her
- Battle of Jutland conducted from bridge
- Most important British warship WWI

**Jellicoe's Leadership:**
- "The only man who could lose the war in an afternoon"

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Class | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Belt Armor | Fate |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------------|------|
| **Iron Duke** | 1914 | 25,000 tons | 21.25 kn | 10× 13.5" | 12" | 3 scrapped 1931-32, 1 depot ship 1946 |
| Queen Elizabeth | 1915 | 27,500 tons | 24 kn | 8× 15" | 13" | Modernized, scrapped 1948-1956 |
| Bayern | Germany | 1916 | 28,600 tons | 22 kn | 8× 15" | 14" | Scuttled Scapa Flow 1919 |
| Nevada | USA | 1916 | 27,500 tons | 20.5 kn | 10× 14" | 13.5" | Pearl Harbor, survived to 1948 |

**Analysis:** Iron Duke-class obsolete by 1920s, outclassed by faster Queen Elizabeth-class with 15-inch guns.

## Legacy

**Jellicoe's Flagship:**

**Last 13.5-Inch Gun Battleships:**
- Iron Duke-class final British 13.5-inch gun battleships
- Superseded by 15-inch guns (Queen Elizabeth)
- Demonstrated limitations of 13.5-inch armament
- Still effective at Jutland

**Marlborough's Torpedo Damage:**
- Demonstrated good British damage control
- Remained in action despite torpedo hit
- Validated compartmentalization design
- Saved by watertight integrity

**Rapid Obsolescence:**
- 21-knot speed too slow by 1920s
- Oil-fired ships more efficient
- 13.5-inch guns outclassed
- Demonstrated rapid warship evolution

**HMS Iron Duke's Longevity:**
- Only ship to survive past 1932
