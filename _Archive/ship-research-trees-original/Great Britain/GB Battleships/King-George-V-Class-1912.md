# King George V-Class Super-Dreadnought Battleships (1912-1913)

## Overview
The King George V-class were four super-dreadnought battleships built 1911-1913, representing the second generation of 13.5-inch gun battleships and incorporating lessons from Orion-class. As improved Orion-class ships with better protection and secondary armament, they formed a powerful squadron in the Grand Fleet during WWI. HMS King George V (flagship), HMS Centurion, HMS Audacious, and HMS Ajax served throughout WWI, though Audacious was lost to a mine (1914, 1 killed). The three survivors participated in Jutland (1916) and were scrapped 1926-1927.

## HMS Audacious Disaster (27 October 1914)

### The Mining

**Circumstances:**
- **Date**: 27 October 1914
- **Location**: Off Tory Island, Donegal, Ireland
- **Mission**: Fleet exercises in Irish waters
- **Mine**: Laid by German auxiliary minelayer Berlin (October 1914)
- **Weather**: Rough seas, hampering rescue

**Sinking Timeline:**
- **10:45 AM**: Hit mine on starboard side
- **Immediate Damage**: Severe flooding, loss of power
- **Evacuation**: Crew transferred to escorting ships
- **Salvage Attempts**: Failed due to rough seas and continued flooding
- **18:55 PM**: Final sinking, capsized and sank (8 hours after mining)
- **Casualties**: 1 killed during evacuation (out of 900 crew)

**Witnesses:**
- RMS Olympic (White Star Line, Titanic's sister ship) witnessed sinking

- HMS Audacious listed as "in service" in official publications
- Photographs and eyewitness accounts censored
- Germany didn't learn of sinking until 1918 (after war ended)
- One of most successful WWI intelligence deceptions

**Justification:**
- Prevented German knowledge of mine warfare success
- Protected morale (first battleship loss was embarrassing)
- Concealed Grand Fleet weakness (down one modern battleship)
- Prevented German confidence boost
- Maintained appearance of British naval strength

**Impact:**
- Demonstrated effectiveness of mine warfare
- Forced Grand Fleet to relocate bases (vulnerability exposed)
- Validated German mine-laying strategy
- Caused British to deploy more minesweepers
- Influenced naval base selection (Scapa Flow fortified)
