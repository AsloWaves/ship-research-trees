# HMS Erin Dreadnought Battleship (1914)

## Overview
HMS Erin was a single dreadnought battleship originally ordered by the Ottoman Empire as Reşadiye, seized by the Royal Navy when WWI broke out in August 1914. Built 1911-1914 at Vickers shipyard, the ship represented Turkey's attempt to acquire modern naval power but became a British asset when diplomatic relations collapsed. As the only King George V-type battleship with 13.5-inch guns in British service not of a standard class, Erin served throughout WWI with the Grand Fleet, participating in Jutland (1916) before being sold to Turkey in 1922 (then resold for scrap before delivery).

## Ottoman Naval Ambitions

### Turkish Dreadnought Programme

**Strategic Context:**
- Ottoman Empire modernizing navy 1910s
- Balkan Wars (1912-1913) demonstrated naval weakness
- Greece ordered dreadnoughts from France
- Turkey needed modern battleships to maintain Black Sea and Aegean control
- National prestige and regional power projection

**Order Details:**
- **Contract**: 1911, Vickers shipyard, Barrow-in-Furness
- **Original Name**: Reşadiye (after Sultan Mehmed V Reşad)
- **Cost**: £2.5 million (paid by Ottoman government)
- **Financing**: Public subscription in Ottoman Empire, national fundraising campaign
- **Design**: Based on King George V-class with modifications for Turkish requirements

**Public Enthusiasm:**
- Nationwide fundraising campaign in Ottoman Empire
- Donations from all social classes
- Symbol of Turkish modernization and pride
- Reşadiye seen as national prestige project

### Seizure Crisis (August 1914)

**International Crisis:**
- **Date**: 1-2 August 1914
- **Context**: WWI outbreak imminent, Britain needed every available battleship
- **Action**: First Lord Winston Churchill ordered seizure before delivery
- **Ottoman Reaction**: Outrage, national humiliation, loss of £2.5M investment
- **Consequences**: Pushed Ottoman Empire toward Central Powers alliance

**Diplomatic Fallout:**
- Ottoman government protested seizure as illegal
- British refused compensation (claimed war emergency powers)
- Germany offered battlecruiser Goeben as replacement
- Goeben's escape to Constantinople (August 1914) cemented Ottoman-German alliance
- Seizure contributed to Ottoman entry into WWI (November 1914)

**Historical Significance:**
- Seizure of Reşadiye and sister ship Sultan Osman I (became HMS Agincourt)
- Contributed to Ottoman Empire joining Central Powers
- British gained two dreadnoughts, but lost Ottoman neutrality
- Strategic blunder: £5M saved, but created new enemy with 500,000-man army

## British Service

### Commissioning and Name

**Royal Navy Integration:**
- **Commissioned**: 22 August 1914 (18 days after seizure)
- **New Name**: HMS Erin (after Ireland, Éireann in Irish)
- **Justification**: Built in Britain with British labor and materials
- **Modifications**: British fire control, communication systems, crew accommodations
- **Quick Integration**: Urgently needed for Grand Fleet

**Design Differences From British Dreadnoughts:**
- Larger secondary armament (16× 6-inch vs typical 12× 4-inch)
- Heavier anti-aircraft battery (Turkish specification)
- Different internal layout (Ottoman crew requirements)
- Modified superstructure and funnel arrangements
- Unique among British dreadnoughts (not part of any standard class)

### Service History

**Grand Fleet Service (1914-1918):**
- 4th Battle Squadron
- Scapa Flow and Rosyth bases
- North Sea patrols and sweeps
- Fleet exercises and readiness drills
- Never missed major operations due to mechanical issues

**Battle of Jutland (31 May - 1 June 1916):**
- **Squadron**: 4th Battle Squadron, Vice-Admiral Sturdee
- **Engagement**: Engaged German battlecruisers and battleships
- **Ammunition Fired**: 85× 13.5-inch shells (third-highest in British fleet)
- **Hits Scored**: Possible hit on German battlecruiser Seydlitz
- **Damage Received**: Struck by single 11-inch shell from SMS Markgraf, minor damage
- **Assessment**: Excellent performance, heavy engagement, well-handled
- **Casualties**: 2 killed, 4 wounded

**North Sea Operations:**
- Numerous sweeps 1914-1918
- Reliable and effective unit
- Never missed operations due to defects
- Good reputation in Grand Fleet
- German Fleet surrender (November 1918)

**Operational Record:**
- 18,000 nautical miles steamed
- Zero major mechanical failures
- Crew praised ship's reliability
- Good sea-keeping and habitability
- Validated Turkish design specifications

## Post-War Fate

### Disposal Complications (1919-1923)

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Britain required to scrap older dreadnoughts
- Erin obsolete compared to Queen Elizabeth and Revenge classes
- Marked for disposal under treaty limits

**Turkish Repurchase Attempt:**
- **1922**: Turkey negotiated to buy back Erin
- **Price**: Nominal (ship was obsolete)
- **Intention**: Symbolic recovery of seized ship, national pride
- **Reality**: Turkey lacked funds to operate battleship
- **Outcome**: Resold to shipbreakers before delivery to Turkey

**Final Scrapping:**
- Sold to shipbreakers 1922
- Dismantled 1922-1923
- Never returned to Turkey despite sale agreement
- Ironic fate: Built for Turkey, seized by Britain, sold to Turkey, scrapped before delivery

## Design Assessment

### Strengths
- Powerful 13.5-inch armament (10 guns)
- Heavy secondary battery (16× 6-inch guns)
- Good anti-aircraft armament (Turkish specification)
- Reliable machinery and systems
- Good sea-keeping and range
- Well-built at Vickers (quality construction)

### Weaknesses
- Not standardized with other British dreadnoughts (logistics problems)
- Unique design complicated spare parts and maintenance
- Heavier than King George V-class (slightly slower)
- Limited modernization due to non-standard design
- 21-knot speed (slower than fast battleships)

### Historical Significance
- **Diplomatic Crisis**: Seizure pushed Ottoman Empire toward Germany
- **Strategic Blunder**: Britain gained ship but created enemy
- **WWI Service**: Solid combat record at Jutland
- **Ottoman Naval History**: Symbol of Turkish modernization frustrated
- **Unique Design**: Only King George V-type 13.5-inch battleship outside standard classes

## Comparison to Contemporaries

### vs King George V-Class (Britain, 1912)
- **Similar**: Based on KGV design with modifications
- **Erin**: Heavier secondary armament (16× 6-inch vs 12× 4-inch)
- **Erin**: Better AA armament (Turkish specification)
- **Verdict**: Erin slightly superior firepower, but non-standard

### vs Orion-Class (Britain, 1912)
- **Similar**: Same 13.5-inch guns, similar speed
- **Erin**: Heavier displacement (25,250 vs 22,200 tons)
- **Erin**: Better secondary and AA armament
- **Verdict**: Erin evolutionary improvement with Turkish modifications

### vs Iron Duke-Class (Britain, 1914)
- **Iron Duke**: 10× 13.5-inch guns (same as Erin)
- **Iron Duke**: Standard British design vs Erin: Unique Turkish design
- **Iron Duke**: Better integration with Grand Fleet (standardized)
- **Verdict**: Iron Duke superior due to standardization

### vs Goeben (Germany, 1912, became Turkish Yavuz)
- **Goeben/Yavuz**: Germany gave to Turkey after Erin seizure
- **Goeben**: Battlecruiser (10× 11-inch, 28 knots) vs Erin: Battleship (10× 13.5-inch, 21 knots)
- **Goeben**: Served Turkey 1914-1973 (59 years!) vs Erin: Never reached Turkey
- **Verdict**: Goeben replaced Erin for Turkey, far more successful

## Battle of Jutland Performance

- Minimal damage showed good armor protection
- Crew performance excellent
- Validated Turkish design specifications for combat

## Legacy

**Ottoman Naval History:**
- Symbol of Turkish naval modernization 1910s
- National humiliation when seized by Britain
- Contributed to Ottoman-German alliance
- Never fulfilled intended role for Turkey
- Goeben (Yavuz) served Turkey instead 1914-1973

**British Naval History:**
- Unique non-standard dreadnought in Grand Fleet
- Solid combat record at Jutland
- Demonstrated British shipbuilding quality (Vickers)
- Example of emergency wartime ship seizure
- Strategic blunder: Gained ship, created enemy

**Diplomatic Legacy:**
- Seizure contributed to Ottoman WWI entry
- Example of British high-handedness 1914
- Lost £2.5M Ottoman investment
- Soured Anglo-Turkish relations for generation
- Influenced Turkish post-war independence movement

**Design Legacy:**
- Validated Turkish design specifications
- Demonstrated heavier secondary armament benefits
- Good AA armament foreshadowed WWI needs
- Non-standardization complications in wartime
- Quality Vickers construction proven in combat

**Quote:**
"HMS Erin's seizure in August 1914 gained Britain one dreadnought but cost the neutrality of the Ottoman Empire - a strategic blunder that added 500,000 enemy soldiers and opened new fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Gallipoli. The ship herself served well at Jutland, but history remembers her more for the consequences of her seizure than for her combat record."
