# Cricket-Class Destroyers (1906)

## Overview
The Cricket-class were coastal destroyers ordered in 1905-1906 as a cheaper alternative to the River-class for inshore work. With 36 ships built, they were smaller and slower but adequate for coastal defense, minesweeping, and patrol duties. They represented the Royal Navy's last attempt at specialized coastal destroyers before standardizing on ocean-going types.

## Design

**Coastal Concept:**
- Smaller than River-class
- Cheaper construction
- Adequate for coastal work
- Economy design

**Key Features:**
- Most used reciprocating engines
- Some had turbines
- Simpler armament
- Lower cost per ship

**Design Philosophy:**
- Coastal defense focus
- Inshore patrol capability
- Minesweeping potential
- Budget-conscious

## Ships and Groups

**Named after Insects:**
- HMS Cricket, Sandfly, Spider, etc.
- Some named after fish: Goldfinch, Grampus
- Varied builder sources
- Mixed propulsion types

**Representative Ships:**
- HMS Cricket - Name ship, 1907
- HMS Gnat - Coastal patrol
- HMS Moth - WWI service
- HMS Sandfly - Minesweeper
- HMS Wasp - Dover Patrol

**Builder Variation:**
- Multiple yards
- Design variations
- Some turbine-powered
- Most reciprocating engines

## Service History

**Pre-WWI Service:**
- Coastal patrol duties
- Home waters operations
- Fleet exercises
- Training platform

**WWI Service:**
- Dover Patrol extensive service
- Minesweeping duties
- Coastal convoy escort
- Anti-submarine patrols

**Notable Operations:**
- Channel defense
- East Coast patrol
- Mine clearance
- U-boat hunting

## Fates

**WWI Losses:**
- Several lost to mines
- Some to submarine attack
- Combat losses limited
- Most survived war

**Post-War:**
- Many sold 1919-1920
- Some converted to minesweepers
- Several served into 1920s
- Last sold by 1923

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Proved coastal type inadequate
- Ocean-going destroyers superior
- Last specialized coastal DD class
- Influenced decision to standardize

**Historical Significance:**
- Ended coastal destroyer concept
- Proved versatility needed
- Showed false economy
- Led to unified fleet destroyer

**Operational Impact:**
- Useful in limited roles
- Minesweeping adaptation successful
- Dover Patrol workhorses
- Proved concept limitations

**Procurement Lessons:**
- Specialized types problematic
- Fleet destroyer better value
- Versatility essential
- Future classes ocean-going only
