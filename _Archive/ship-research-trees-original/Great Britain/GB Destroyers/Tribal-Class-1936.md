# Tribal-Class Destroyers (1936)

## Overview
The Tribal-class were large, heavily-armed destroyers designed to counter foreign "super-destroyers" with emphasis on gun firepower over torpedoes. Twenty-seven ships were built for the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Australian Navy (1936-1945). They were among the most powerful destroyers of WWII but suffered heavy losses - 13 of 27 sunk in combat. HMCS Haida survives as a museum ship in Canada.

## Design Philosophy

**Countering Foreign Super-Destroyers:**
- Response to Japanese Fubuki-class, German Narvik-class
- **Gun emphasis** over torpedoes
- 8× 4.7-inch guns vs 4-5 on previous British destroyers
- Only 4 torpedo tubes vs 8-10 on previous classes

**Large & Powerful:**
- 1,870 tons (much larger than typical destroyers)
- Excellent seakeeping
- Strong firepower
- Reduced torpedo armament controversial

**Cost:**
- £520,000 per ship (expensive)
- About £340,000 hull, £180,000 weapons
