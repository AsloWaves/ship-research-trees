# Q & R-Class Destroyers (1941-1942)

## Overview
The Q and R-classes were War Emergency Programme destroyers with 16 ships built 1941-1942 (8 per class). Near-identical to O/P-classes, they continued the simplified fleet destroyer design for rapid wartime construction. The class served extensively in WWII across all theaters with moderate losses.
