# County-Class Guided Missile Destroyers (1961-1970)

## Overview
The County-class were the first British guided missile destroyers (DDGs), with 8 ships built 1961-1970 in two batches. Designed for fleet air defense with Seaslug SAM systems, they were large ships at 5,440 tons standard, representing a revolutionary shift from guns to missiles. They served extensively during the Cold War, Falklands War, and Gulf operations before retirement in the 1980s.

## Design

**First British DDGs:**
- Seaslug beam-riding SAM system
- Twin-arm launcher aft
- Large magazine (30 missiles)
- Combined steam/gas turbine propulsion (COSAG)
- Helicopter hangar and flight deck

**Key Features:**
- Revolutionary missile armament
- Combined propulsion for sprint speed
- Fleet air defense role
- ASW helicopter capability
- Advanced radar systems

**Batch Differences:**
- **Batch 1 (4 ships, 1962-1964):** Original Seaslug Mk.1, original radar
- **Batch 2 (4 ships, 1966-1970):** Improved Seaslug Mk.2, enhanced electronics

## Ships

**Batch 1 (1962-1964):**
1. HMS Devonshire (D02) - Name ship
2. HMS Hampshire (D06)
3. HMS Kent (D12)
4. HMS London (D16)

**Batch 2 (1966-1970):**
5. HMS Fife (D20)
6. HMS Glamorgan (D18) - Falklands hero
7. HMS Antrim (D18)
8. HMS Norfolk (D23)

## Service History

**Cold War Operations:**
- NATO fleet operations
- Mediterranean deployments
- Far East patrols
- Indian Ocean presence
- Flag showing duties

**Falklands War (1982):**
- HMS Glamorgan - Hit by Exocet, survived, heroic damage control
- HMS Antrim - South Georgia recapture, Fortuna Glacier rescue
- HMS Coventry sunk (Type 42, not County)
- Seaslug used in combat (limited success)

**Notable Actions:**
- HMS Glamorgan - Survived Exocet hit, June 12, 1982
- HMS Antrim - SAS/SBS operations support
- HMS Fife - Confrontation operations
- Multiple Cold War deployments

## Modernization

**Batch 2 Improvements:**
- Seaslug Mk.2 (better range/reliability)
- Enhanced radar systems
- Improved electronics
- Better helicopter facilities

**1970s Updates:**
- Electronics modernization
- Exocet SSM added (some ships)
- Radar upgrades
- ASW improvements

## Combat Performance

**Falklands Assessment:**
- Seaslug limited effectiveness
- HMS Glamorgan damage control exemplary
- 4.5-inch guns valuable for shore bombardment
- Helicopter operations crucial
- Demonstrated survivability

**System Limitations:**
- Seaslug obsolescent by 1982
- Beam-riding less effective than modern missiles
- Large size vulnerable
- Limited close-in defense

## Decommissioning

**1980s Retirement:**
- Most decommissioned 1980-1985
- Replaced by Type 42 destroyers
- Last (HMS Fife) 1987
- 20-25 year service lives

**Final Fates:**
- HMS Glamorgan → Chile (Almirante Latorre), scrapped 1998
- HMS Fife → Chile (Blanco Encalada), scrapped 2003
- HMS Antrim → Chile (Almirante Cochrane), scrapped 1984
- Others scrapped 1980s
- None preserved

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Revolutionary missile destroyers
- Large, capable ships
- Seaslug limitations apparent
- Effective helicopter platforms

**Historical Significance:**
- First British guided missile destroyers
- Falklands War veterans
- Transition to missile age
- Pioneered DDG concept

**Operational Impact:**
- Effective fleet air defense (Cold War)
- Falklands War crucial presence
- Proved DDG concept
- Influenced Type 42 design

**Design Influence:**
- Led to Type 82 (Bristol)
- Influenced Type 42 design
- Large DDG concept
- Combined propulsion systems
