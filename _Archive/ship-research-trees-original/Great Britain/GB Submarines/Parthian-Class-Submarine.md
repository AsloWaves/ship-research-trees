# Parthian-Class Submarines (1929-1931)

## Overview
The Parthian-class were large patrol submarines with 6 boats built 1929-1931. Designed for Far East service with exceptional range and habitability, they were enlarged Odin-class designs. The class saw extensive WWII service with very heavy losses - all 6 boats were lost in action.

## Design

**Far East Patrol Submarine:**
- Exceptional range (10,000 nm)
- Improved habitability over Odin-class
- Larger displacement
- Long-range operations
- China Station deployment

**Key Features:**
- Outstanding surface range
- Heavy torpedo armament (8 tubes)
- Good speed (17.5 knots surface)
- Enhanced crew comfort
- Tropical operations capable

**Design Philosophy:**
- Far East deployment priority
- Extended patrols
- Improved over Odin-class
- Self-sufficient operations
- Colonial station duties

## Boats

1. **Parthian** - 1930, lost 1943
2. **Pandora** - 1930, lost 1942
3. **Perseus** - 1930, lost 1941
4. **Phoenix** - 1930, lost 1940
5. **Poseidon** - 1930, lost 1931 (peacetime accident)
6. **Proteus** - 1931, lost 1943

## Interwar Service

**Far East Deployment:**
- China Station
- Singapore base
- Mediterranean Fleet
- Indian Ocean patrols
- Colonial deployments

**Peacetime Loss:**
- **Poseidon** - Collision with Chinese steamer, 1931 (crew saved)

## WWII Service

**Extensive War Operations:**
- Mediterranean patrols
- Far East operations
- Norwegian campaign
- Anti-shipping missions
- Special operations

**Major Actions:**
- Malta operations
- Greece evacuations
- North Africa support
- Anti-shipping patrols
- Reconnaissance missions

## Losses

**Total Loss: 6 of 6 lost (100%):**

**Peacetime:**
- **Poseidon** - Collision, 1931 (raised, returned to service, later lost 1943 as training sub)

**WWII:**
- **Phoenix** - Mined off Augusta, July 1940
- **Perseus** - Mined off Cephalonia, December 1941 (1 survivor)
- **Pandora** - Bombed by aircraft, April 1942
- **Parthian** - Depth charged off Sicily, August 1943
- **Proteus** - Lost in Adriatic, 1943 (cause unknown)

**Tragic Loss Rate:**
- All 6 boats lost
- Mediterranean operations deadly
- Mining and depth charge casualties
- No survivors from class
- Total class extinction

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Excellent patrol submarine design
- Outstanding range capability
- Good habitability
- Tragic war record
- Total class loss

**Historical Significance:**
- Designed for Far East service
- 10,000 nm range exceptional
- All boats lost WWII
- Mediterranean service costly
- Total class extinction

**Operational Impact:**
- Extensive war service
- Mediterranean combat
- Far East operations
- Heavy sacrifices
- All boats lost in action

**Design Influence:**
- Influenced future patrol submarines
- Range requirements validated
- Far East deployment lessons
- Led to improved wartime designs
- Habitability standards set

**Notable:**
- **Perseus** - John Capes survived sinking, escaped from 52m depth, only survivor from entire class
- Only RN submarine class with 100% loss rate
- All lost in combat or accidents
- Represented ultimate sacrifice
