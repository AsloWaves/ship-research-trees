# Upholder-Class (Type 2400) Submarines (1986-1993)

## Overview
The Upholder-class (Type 2400) were advanced diesel-electric submarines with 4 boats built 1986-1993. They were the last conventional submarines built for the Royal Navy, featuring modern automation, advanced sensors, and air-independent propulsion capability. Despite being highly capable, all four were retired early (1994) and sold to Canada, where they serve as the Victoria-class.

## Design

**Modern Automated Submarine:**
- Advanced automation (reduced crew)
- Computer-controlled systems
- Modern sensor suite
- Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missiles
- AIP-capable design (never installed)

**Key Features:**
- Very high submerged speed (20 knots)
- Small crew (47 vs 68 on Oberon)
- Modern combat system
- Quiet operations
- Excellent sensors

**Design Philosophy:**
- Maximum automation
- Reduced manning
- Modern technology
- Cost-effective operations
- Post-Cold War requirements

## Boats

1. **Upholder** (S40) - 1990, sold to Canada (HMCS Victoria)
2. **Unseen** (S41) - 1991, sold to Canada (HMCS Windsor)
3. **Ursula** (S42) - 1992, sold to Canada (HMCS Corner Brook)
4. **Unicorn** (S43) - 1993, sold to Canada (HMCS Chicoutimi)

## Royal Navy Service

**Brief RN Career (1990-1994):**
- Training operations
- NATO exercises
- North Atlantic patrols
- Limited operational service
- Early decommissioning

**Early Retirement:**
- "Options for Change" defense review
- All-nuclear submarine decision
- Cost-cutting measures
- Laid up 1994
- Only 4 years average service

## Sale to Canada

**Canadian Acquisition (1998-2004):**
- Purchased for CAD$750 million
- Renamed Victoria-class
- Extensive refit required
- Entry into service delayed
- Ongoing Canadian service

**Victoria-Class (Canada):**
- HMCS Victoria (ex-Upholder)
- HMCS Windsor (ex-Unseen)
- HMCS Corner Brook (ex-Ursula)
- HMCS Chicoutimi (ex-Unicorn)

**Canadian Service Issues:**
- Fire aboard Chicoutimi (2004, 1 fatality)
- Extensive refits required
- Technical problems
- Long periods alongside
- Controversial procurement

## Capabilities

**Advanced Systems:**
- Type 2040 sonar
- Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missiles
- Tigerfish/Spearfish torpedoes
- Modern combat system
- Electronic warfare suite

**Performance:**
- Exceptionally quiet
- 20 knots submerged
- Advanced automation
- Good endurance
- Effective weapons

## Losses

**Zero RN Losses:**
- All 4 survived RN service
- Brief operational period
- No accidents or incidents
- Early retirement
- Transferred to Canada

**Canadian Service:**
- 1 fatality (Chicoutimi fire, 2004)
- Ongoing technical issues
- No boats lost
- Operational challenges

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Highly capable modern design
- Advanced automation successful
- Excellent performance
- Political retirement (not technical)
- Controversial early decommissioning

**Historical Significance:**
- Last RN diesel submarines
- End of 90+ year diesel submarine tradition
- Advanced automation pioneer
- Shortest-lived RN submarine class
- Canadian service continues

**Operational Impact:**
- Limited RN operational service
- Political/economic retirement
- All-nuclear fleet decision
- Canadian capability restored
- Export (unwanted) success

**Design Influence:**
- Modern diesel submarine standards
- Automation technology
- AIP-capable design
- Influenced future designs
- Canada's current submarine fleet

**Controversy:**
- Expensive to build, quickly retired
- Capability lost from RN
- Canadian technical problems
- Political decision criticized
- "What might have been"

**Note:**
- Only RN submarine class retired for political/economic reasons rather than age or obsolescence
- Represented cutting-edge diesel technology
- All-nuclear decision remains debated
- Canadian Victoria-class continues to operate (2020s)
