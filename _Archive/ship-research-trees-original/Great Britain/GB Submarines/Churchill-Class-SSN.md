# Churchill-Class Nuclear Submarines (1968-1970)

## Overview
The Churchill-class were nuclear-powered attack submarines with 3 boats built 1968-1970. Originally designed as Valiant-class, they featured minor improvements and were later reclassified as a separate class. They served successfully through the Cold War with HMS Conqueror achieving fame in the Falklands War for sinking the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano.

## Design

**Improved Valiant-Class:**
- Minor improvements over Valiant
- Same PWR1 reactor
- Enhanced systems
- Slightly larger displacement
- Improved sensors

**Key Features:**
- Rolls-Royce PWR1 reactor
- 28+ knots submerged
- Unlimited endurance
- Advanced sonar
- Heavy torpedo armament

**Design Philosophy:**
- Evolution of Valiant-class
- Cold War ASW role
- Soviet submarine tracking
- Strategic deterrent protection
- Hunter-killer operations

## Boats

1. **Churchill** (S104) - 1970
2. **Conqueror** (S105) - 1971
3. **Courageous** (S106) - 1971

**Note:** All three originally ordered as Valiant-class, later reclassified as Churchill-class due to improvements.

## Service History

**Cold War Operations:**
- Arctic patrols
- Soviet submarine tracking
- Atlantic operations
- Mediterranean deployments
- Intelligence gathering

**Falklands War (1982):**
- **HMS Conqueror** - Historic combat action
  - Deployed April 1982
  - Tracked Argentine carrier Veinticinco de Mayo
  - Sank ARA General Belgrano, May 2, 1982
  - First (and only) submarine torpedo sinking since WWII
  - Used Mk 8 torpedoes (WWII-era, proven reliable)
  - 323 Argentine casualties
  - Flew Jolly Roger on return to Faslane
  - Strategic impact: Argentine fleet withdrew

**Special Operations:**
- Covert reconnaissance
- Special forces insertions
- Electronic intelligence
- NATO exercises
- Training missions

## HMS Conqueror - Falklands Detail

**Combat Action:**
- Detected Belgrano task group
- Stalked for 30 hours
- Attacked: May 2, 1982, 16:00
- Fired 3× Mk 8 torpedoes
- 2 hits (bow and stern)
- Belgrano sank in 44 minutes
- Conqueror evaded counterattack
- No damage sustained

**Weapon Choice:**
- Tigerfish available but unreliable
- Mk 8 torpedoes chosen (WWII design)
- Pragmatic decision vindicated
- Proven reliability over modern technology
- Commander Chris Wreford-Brown decision

**Strategic Impact:**
- Argentine surface fleet withdrew
- Confined to ports remainder of war
- Task force threat eliminated
- Changed course of conflict
- Controversial but decisive

## Modernizations

**1970s-1980s Updates:**
- Type 2020/2024 sonar suites
- Tigerfish torpedo systems
- Communications upgrades
- Electronic warfare systems
- Spearfish torpedoes (later)

## Retirement

**Decommissioning:**
- **Churchill** - Paid off 1992 (22 years)
- **Conqueror** - Paid off 1990 (19 years, shortened due to Falklands fame/age)
- **Courageous** - Paid off 1992 (21 years)

**Disposal:**
- All laid up Rosyth
- Awaiting final disposal
- Reactor compartments stored
- Gradual dismantlement

## Losses

**Zero Losses:**
- All 3 boats survived service
- No accidents or combat damage
- Conqueror returned safely from combat
- Successful operational careers
- Perfect safety record

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful improved Valiant design
- Combat proven (Conqueror)
- Reliable operations
- Long service lives
- Cold War effectiveness

**Historical Significance:**
- HMS Conqueror - only submarine torpedo kill since WWII
- Only nuclear submarine combat sinking
- Falklands War combat veteran
- Cold War strategic assets
- Last boats to sink warship with torpedoes

**Operational Impact:**
- Falklands combat operations (decisive)
- Cold War deterrence
- Soviet submarine tracking
- Arctic operations
- Training excellence

**Design Influence:**
- Transitional design to Swiftsure-class
- Validated PWR1 reactor
- Proved SSN combat effectiveness
- Influenced tactical doctrine
- Informed future designs

**HMS Conqueror Cultural Impact:**
- Most famous British submarine since WWII
- Jolly Roger tradition revived
- Controversial but legally justified action
- Changed submarine warfare perception
- Cold War turned hot (briefly)

**Technical Achievements:**
- Reliable PWR1 operations
- 28 knots submerged
- Combat effectiveness proven
- Arctic capability
- Long-range operations

**Quote:**
"Sink the Belgrano" - Order from Northwood that changed Falklands War
"HMS Conqueror - returning from patrol" - Understated signal on return with Jolly Roger flying
