# R-Class Submarines (1918-1919)

## Overview
The R-class were high-speed fleet submarines with 12 boats built 1918-1919. Designed for improved surface speed and endurance, they were enlarged L-class designs intended for fleet operations. The class saw no WWI combat but extensive post-war service, with several serving into WWII and others transferred to foreign navies.

## Design

**High-Speed Submerged Design:**
- Exceptional submerged speed (15 knots)
- Optimized for underwater performance
- Streamlined hull design
- Fleet submarine role
- Developed from L-class

**Key Features:**
- Six 18-inch torpedo tubes
- Very high submerged speed
- Compact efficient design
- Reliable diesel-electric
- Good maneuverability

**Design Philosophy:**
- Speed underwater prioritized
- Fleet operations capable
- Anti-submarine role
- Hunter-killer concept
- Proven technology

## Boats

**R1-R12:** Commissioned 1918-1919

**Notable Boats:**
- **R1** - Scrapped 1923
- **R4** - Lost 1919 (collision)
- **R8** - Transferred to Royal Australian Navy
- **R11** - Long post-war service

## WWI Service

**No War Service:**
- Commissioned post-armistice
- Too late for WWI combat
- Training operations
- Fleet duties
- Peacetime deployment

## Interwar Service

**Extensive Peacetime Operations:**
- Fleet submarine duties
- Mediterranean deployments
- Anti-submarine training
- Home Fleet operations
- Foreign transfers

**Foreign Service:**
- Some transferred to Commonwealth navies
- Training boats
- 1920s-1930s service
- Eventually scrapped

## WWII Service

**Limited WWII Use:**
- Most scrapped by 1939
- A few saw early war service
- Training duties
- Obsolescent by WWII
- Replaced by modern types

## Losses

**Single Loss:**
- **R4** - Collision in Portsmouth, 1919

**Low Loss Rate:**
- Only 1 of 12 lost (8%)
- Safe operational record
- Reliable design
- Peacetime service

## Post-War Fate

**Most Scrapped Interwar:**
- Limited operational lives
- Replaced by newer designs
- Some foreign transfers
- Few survived to WWII
- 15-20 year service lives

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful high-speed design
- Exceptional submerged performance
- Reliable operations
- Limited war service
- Transitional design

**Historical Significance:**
- Very high submerged speed (15 knots)
- Anti-submarine hunter-killer concept
- Influenced interwar designs
- Proven diesel-electric technology
- Compact efficient design

**Operational Impact:**
- Post-war fleet submarine
- Training platform
- Limited war impact (no WWI combat)
- Interwar development role
- Safe operational record

**Design Influence:**
- High-speed submerged concept
- Led to interwar fleet submarines
- Hunter-killer role development
- Streamlined hull lessons
- Influenced future designs
