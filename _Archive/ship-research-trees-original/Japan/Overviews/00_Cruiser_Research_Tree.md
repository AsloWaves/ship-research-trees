## Historical Context

### Early Development (1898-1918)
- Protected cruisers for colonial patrol and commerce protection
- Armored cruisers for fleet scouting and independent operations
- Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) demonstrated cruiser effectiveness
- Battlecruiser reclassification of armored cruisers

### Interwar Era (1918-1941)
- Washington Naval Treaty (1922) limited battleship construction, spurred cruiser development
- Light cruisers as destroyer leaders and scout cruisers
- London Naval Treaty (1930) established 8-inch/6-inch gun distinction
- Heavy cruiser development under treaty limits (10,000 tons, 8-inch guns)
- Mogami-class built with 15× 6.1-inch guns, later converted to 10× 8-inch

### WWII Era (1941-1945)
- Heavy cruisers formed core of surface action groups
- Light cruisers as destroyer squadron flagships
- Most cruisers sunk in surface actions or air attacks 1942-1944
- Aviation cruisers (Tone-class) provided reconnaissance for fleet

## Notable Service

### Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)
- Protected and armored cruisers in fleet actions
- Battle of Tsushima (1905)

### World War I (1914-1918)
- Limited Pacific operations

### China Operations (1937-1941)
- Shore bombardment and naval support

### World War II (1941-1945)

- **Pearl Harbor (1941):** Tone and Chikuma reconnaissance
- **Java Sea (1942):** Heavy cruiser victories
- **Savo Island (1942):** Decisive night action victory
- **Midway (1942):** Mogami, Mikuma heavily damaged

#### Mid-War (1942-1944)
- **Guadalcanal Campaign (1942-1943):** Multiple cruiser battles
- **Empress Augusta Bay (1943):** Sendai sunk
- **Numerous night actions in Solomon Islands**

#### Late War (1944-1945)
- **Battle of the Philippine Sea (1944):** Heavy cruiser losses
- **Battle of Leyte Gulf (1944):** Most remaining heavy cruisers sunk or damaged
- **Most surviving cruisers sunk by submarine or air attack 1944-1945**

## Cruiser Doctrine

Japanese cruiser doctrine emphasized:
1. **Night Fighting:** Specialized training for night surface combat
2. **Torpedo Armament:** Heavy torpedo batteries (8-16× Type 93 "Long Lance")
3. **Speed:** High speed for scouting and destroyer leadership
4. **Aviation:** Integration of floatplanes for reconnaissance
5. **Offensive Action:** Aggressive surface combat tactics
