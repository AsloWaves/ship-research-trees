# 6. DATABASE INTEGRATION & CROSS-REFERENCING

## 6.1 Ship-to-Weapon Linking - HIGH Priority

- Link ships to their missile systems
- Link torpedo tubes to torpedo types

**Schema Design Needed**:
```
Ship_Armament Table:
- Ship_ID (FK to Ships)
- Weapon_ID (FK to Guns/Missiles/Torpedoes)
- Weapon_Type (Gun, Missile, Torpedo, Aircraft)
- Mount_Location (Forward, Aft, Port, Starboard, etc.)
- Quantity
- Year_Installed
- Year_Removed
- Notes
```

**Estimated Work**: 1,000+ ship-to-weapon links

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ✅ **Start with Japan** - Most critical missing Axis power, extensive carrier operations
2. ✅ **Add Japan & Germany Aircraft Weapons** - Aircraft exist but have zero weapons
3. ✅ **Expand Germany Aircraft** - Only 8 aircraft is insufficient coverage

### Tools & Automation:
- Reuse existing naval guns generation scripts for Italy/France/Soviet guns
- Create import templates for aircraft/weapons based on existing schema
- Develop automated cross-referencing scripts

### Quality Standards:
- Maintain existing YAML frontmatter standards for ships
- Use established formulas for estimated values (shell length, bursting charge)
- Cite sources (NavWeaps, Wikipedia, archives) for all new data
- Mark fictional/generated entries with `Modded: 1` flag
