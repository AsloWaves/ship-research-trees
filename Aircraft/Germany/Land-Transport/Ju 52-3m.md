## History

The Junkers Ju 52/3m, affectionately nicknamed "Tante Ju" (Auntie Junkers), was the backbone of German air transport throughout World War II and one of the most recognizable aircraft of the era. Originally designed as a civilian airliner in the early 1930s, the tri-motor Ju 52 became Deutsche Lufthansa's standard transport and served with airlines worldwide before being adapted for military use.

The Ju 52's military career began during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), where it served initially as a bomber before demonstrating greater value as a transport. During WWII, the Ju 52 became indispensable to German operations, serving in every theater and every major campaign. It was the primary aircraft for Germany's airborne forces, dropping paratroopers during the invasions of Norway, the Low Countries, Crete, and numerous operations on the Eastern Front. The legendary capture of the Belgian fort Eben Emael in 1940 involved Ju 52s towing DFS 230 gliders.

The Ju 52 also formed the backbone of the Luftwaffe's transport fleet, supplying ground forces across vast distances. It played crucial roles in major supply operations including the attempted airlift to besieged Stalingrad in winter 1942-43, where hundreds were lost to Soviet fighters and weather. Despite being slow, obsolescent, and vulnerable to fighter attack, the rugged, reliable Ju 52 continued serving until Germany's surrender. Its corrugated metal construction, fixed landing gear, and three radial engines gave it a distinctive appearance that remains iconic. Post-war, the type continued civilian service in Spain and Switzerland for decades.
