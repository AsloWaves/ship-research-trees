## History

The Gotha Go 244 was a powered conversion of the successful Go 242 assault glider, developed to address the shortage of towing aircraft and reduce the vulnerability of glider operations. The Go 242 had proven itself an effective tactical transport glider, but the need for scarce tow aircraft limited its utility. By adding engines, the Go 244 became self-sufficient while retaining the Go 242's excellent short-field performance and cargo capacity.

Development involved fitting the existing Go 242 airframe with two engines. Early variants (Go 244A) used captured French Gnome-Rhône 14M radial engines, the same powerplants used on the Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft. Later variants (Go 244B) attempted to use German BMW 132 engines, but these were in short supply. The conversion was relatively straightforward, with engines mounted in nacelles on the high wing.

Approximately 133 Go 244s were produced, serving primarily on the Eastern Front from 1942-1944. They proved useful for tactical supply missions to forward airfields and rough landing strips where their short-field capability was valuable. However, the type suffered from the same engine reliability problems as the Hs 129, with the Gnome-Rhône engines prone to overheating and mechanical failure. The Go 244 was also slow and vulnerable to fighter attack, making operations increasingly difficult as Soviet air superiority grew. Most were lost to accidents, mechanical failure, or enemy action by late 1944, with surviving examples relegated to secondary roles or converted back to glider configuration.

## Notable Features

- Powered conversion of Go 242 assault glider
- Twin-boom configuration
- Excellent short-field performance inherited from glider design
- High-mounted wing for ground clearance
- Large rear cargo doors for vehicle loading
- Could operate from rough, unprepared strips
- Used captured French engines (most variants)
- Retained some glider characteristics (could glide if engines failed)
- Relatively simple conversion from unpowered glider
- Tricycle landing gear with large, low-pressure tires
