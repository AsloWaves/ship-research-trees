## Notes

Naval carrier variant of Bf 109E. Extended wingspan (36.35 ft vs 32.5 ft) for better low-speed handling. Added catapult fittings, arresting hook. DB 601N engine (1200hp). 70 ordered, only 7 T-1 with full carrier equipment built. Remaining 63 built as T-2 without carrier equipment, used in Norway on short airstrips. Performance closely matched E-4/N but with shorter takeoff/landing capability.
