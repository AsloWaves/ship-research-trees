## History

The Heinkel He 100 was one of the most advanced fighter designs of the late 1930s, featuring innovative evaporative cooling and achieving remarkable speeds that made it one of the fastest piston-engine fighters of its era. The He 100D variant set a world airspeed record of 746.6 km/h in March 1939, though this was achieved with a specially-prepared racing version.

Despite its impressive performance, the He 100 lost the Luftwaffe competition to the Bf 109, primarily due to the complexity of its evaporative cooling system and Heinkel's commitment to bomber production. The Kriegsmarine briefly considered the type for carrier operations aboard Graf Zeppelin due to its high speed and compact dimensions, but this came to nothing when the carrier program stalled.

Only about 25 production He 100D fighters were built, most of which were sold to the Soviet Union and Japan for evaluation, or used for propaganda purposes. Some were retained in Germany for factory defense duties. The type was famously used in propaganda photographs, being misidentified as various fictional fighter types to confuse Allied intelligence about German fighter production.

## Notable Features

- Revolutionary evaporative cooling system eliminating traditional radiators
- Extremely clean aerodynamic design
- Surface evaporative cooling with wing leading edge condensers
- One of the fastest piston fighters of 1939
- Very small, compact airframe
- Advanced but maintenance-intensive cooling system
- Limited production due to complexity and Bf 109 standardization
