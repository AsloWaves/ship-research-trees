## Notes

Biplane torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft designed for Graf Zeppelin. DB 601B engine (1100hp). Featured folding wings, arresting hook, catapult capability. Exceptional STOL performance - could take off in 150 ft and land in just 100 ft. Could carry 1000kg bomb/torpedo or four 50kg bombs. Fuel: 1300 liters (343 gal). Only 12 built as Graf Zeppelin cancelled. Later saw limited service in Aegean and anti-shipping operations 1942-43. Excellent low-speed handling and carrier suitability but obsolete by WWII standards.
