## History

The Fw 190A-5/U14 represented an innovative approach to torpedo bombing, converting the highly successful Fw 190 fighter into a fast torpedo strike aircraft. The "U14" Umrüst-Bausatz (factory conversion kit) designation indicated a specialized torpedo-carrying configuration based on the A-5 airframe. This variant was developed in response to the need for a high-speed torpedo bomber that could penetrate Allied fighter defenses more effectively than slower bombers.

The conversion involved strengthening the fuselage centerline to carry a torpedo on an ETC 502 rack, along with simplified armament (often reducing the standard four cannon armament to two cannons and two machine guns) to save weight. The aircraft retained excellent handling characteristics despite the torpedo load, and its high speed made it far more survivable than conventional torpedo bombers.

Fw 190A-5/U14s were deployed primarily with SKG 10 (Schnellkampfgeschwader 10) in Norway for attacks on Arctic convoys and with units in the Mediterranean. The type's high speed and fighter-like maneuverability gave it a significant advantage over traditional torpedo bombers, though the limited number produced meant it remained a relatively rare variant. The torpedo-carrying Fw 190s achieved several successes against Allied shipping, but by late 1944, most were converted back to standard fighter-bomber configuration or ground attack roles.

## Notable Features
