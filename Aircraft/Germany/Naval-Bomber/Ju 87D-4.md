## History

The Ju 87D-4 was a specialized torpedo bomber variant of the famous Stuka dive bomber, developed in response to the Kriegsmarine's need for torpedo-capable aircraft. Based on the improved Ju 87D airframe with its more powerful Jumo 211J engine and increased range, the D-4 variant was modified to carry an aerial torpedo for anti-shipping missions.

The D-4 featured a strengthened bomb crutch mechanism adapted to swing a torpedo clear of the propeller arc during release, similar to the bomb release mechanism but modified for the torpedo's greater weight and different aerodynamic properties. The wing-mounted machine guns were often removed to save weight and improve performance when carrying the heavy torpedo load.

These aircraft were deployed primarily in the Mediterranean and Black Sea theaters, where they operated against Allied shipping. The torpedo-carrying Stukas achieved some successes but were vulnerable to fighter attack due to their slow speed and limited maneuverability when carrying torpedoes. By 1944, most D-4 variants were relegated to anti-shipping missions in areas with limited Allied fighter presence or were converted back to standard bombing configuration.

## Notable Features

- Modified bomb crutch for torpedo release
- Based on long-range Ju 87D airframe
- Improved Jumo 211J engine with better performance
- Extended fuel capacity for maritime patrol missions
- Reinforced landing gear from D-series improvements
- Retained dive bombing capability when not carrying torpedoes
- Often operated with reduced defensive armament to save weight
