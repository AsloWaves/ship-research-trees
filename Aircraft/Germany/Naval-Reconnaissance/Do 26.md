## History

The Dornier Do 26 represented the pinnacle of pre-war German flying boat design, created specifically for Deutsche Lufthansa's transatlantic mail service. Designed by Claude Dornier, it featured innovative retractable wing-mounted floats (sponsons) and four diesel engines in tandem push-pull configuration, making it one of the most technologically advanced flying boats of its era.

Only six Do 26s were built, with three entering Lufthansa service in 1939 for the South Atlantic mail route to South America. The aircraft could be catapult-launched from depot ships to extend their already impressive range. However, the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 abruptly ended civilian transatlantic operations.

All six Do 26s were impressed into military service with the Luftwaffe, operating with KüFlGr 406 and later Küstenfliegergruppe 406 (SAGr 126) for long-range maritime reconnaissance and transport missions. They flew from Norwegian fjords and French bases, conducting patrols over the North Atlantic and Arctic. The type's extreme range made it valuable for tracking Allied convoys, but the aircraft were rare and precious, with losses carefully avoided. By 1942, most surviving Do 26s were relegated to transport duties in the Arctic theater. The last examples were destroyed to prevent capture in 1944.

## Notable Features

- Exceptional 8,000 km range
- Designed for catapult launch from ships
- Sleek, streamlined hull with Dornier's characteristic design
- Retractable floats reduced drag significantly
- Could operate in very rough sea conditions
- Advanced for its time but too complex for wartime production
- One of few four-engine flying boats with retractable stabilizing floats
