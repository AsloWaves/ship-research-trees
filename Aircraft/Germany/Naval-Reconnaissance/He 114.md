## Notes

Sesquiplane reconnaissance floatplane intended to replace He 60. BMW 132K engine (960hp). Twin floats. Poor water-handling characteristics and only marginally better performance than He 60. Did not meet strength requirements for catapult launches. Sesquiplane design with much smaller lower wing. Failed to be adopted by Kriegsmarine. Despite poor performance, small production undertaken. 98-118 built depending on source. Eventually sold off to Romania, Spain, and Sweden. Replaced by superior Ar 196. One of least successful German floatplane designs.
