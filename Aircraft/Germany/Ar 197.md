## Notes

Biplane carrier fighter prototype for Graf Zeppelin. BMW 132Dc engine (880hp). Competed with Bf 109T. Only 3 prototypes built (V1, V2, V3). V2 fitted with naval equipment including arresting hook and catapult spools. Could carry 4x 50kg SC50 bombs. Rejected in favor of more modern monoplane design. By time Graf Zeppelin would have been completed, biplanes like Ar 197 would have been hopelessly outclassed as fighters. Project cancelled 1937.
