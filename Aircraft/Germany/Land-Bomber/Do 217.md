## History

The Dornier Do 217 was developed as a larger, more powerful successor to the Do 17, incorporating lessons learned from the Spanish Civil War and early WWII operations. The design featured significantly increased bomb load, better defensive armament, and much longer range compared to its predecessor. The Do 217 served in multiple roles including medium bomber, night bomber, maritime strike, reconnaissance, and night fighter.

Bomber variants of the Do 217 equipped several Kampfgeschwader units and saw extensive service over Britain during 1940-1943, the Eastern Front, and the Mediterranean. The Do 217E introduced improved BMW 801 radial engines, while the Do 217K featured an extensively redesigned glazed nose for better visibility. The K-2 variant was specially equipped to carry advanced guided weapons, becoming one of the first operational missile carriers. Do 217s launched Fritz X radio-guided bombs that sank the Italian battleship Roma in September 1943, demonstrating the potential of precision-guided munitions.

The Do 217N night fighter variant featured a solid nose packed with cannons and radar equipment. These aircraft served with Nachtjagdgeschwader units defending Germany against RAF night bombing raids. The Do 217N could carry both nose-mounted and Schräge Musik (upward-firing) cannon installations, making it a dangerous opponent for RAF bombers. However, the type was eventually superseded by more specialized designs like the He 219 and Ju 88G. Production ended in 1943 after about 1,905 aircraft, with surviving Do 217s serving in secondary roles until war's end.
