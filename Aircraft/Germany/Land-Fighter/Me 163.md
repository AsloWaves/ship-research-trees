## History

The Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet was the only rocket-powered fighter to achieve operational status and remains one of the most radical aircraft designs ever to see combat. Developed from Alexander Lippisch's tailless glider designs, the Me 163 represented an extreme solution to the problem of intercepting high-altitude Allied bombers: a small, lightweight aircraft propelled by a powerful but short-duration rocket motor.

The Komet's performance was extraordinary - it could climb to 12,000 meters in under three minutes and achieve speeds approaching 960 km/h, making it by far the fastest aircraft of World War II. However, these capabilities came with severe limitations. The volatile T-Stoff and C-Stoff rocket fuels were highly corrosive and dangerous, causing numerous ground accidents. The powered endurance was only 7-8 minutes, after which the aircraft became a glider. The landing skid (the wheeled dolly was jettisoned after takeoff) made landings hazardous, and any remaining fuel often exploded on impact.

Operationally, the Me 163 equipped JG 400 from mid-1944. Pilots faced an incredibly difficult challenge: climbing rapidly to intercept altitude, positioning for attack during the brief powered phase, and making a single high-speed pass through bomber formations before gliding back to base. The 30mm cannons required precise aim during fleeting attack opportunities. Despite these challenges, Me 163 pilots claimed approximately 9 confirmed victories against Allied bombers, though this came at the cost of 14 Me 163s lost. The aircraft was more dangerous to its own pilots than to the enemy, with the volatile fuel causing numerous fatal accidents.
