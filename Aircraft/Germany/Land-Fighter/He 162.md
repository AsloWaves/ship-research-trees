## History

The He 162 Salamander, popularly known as the "Volksjäger" (People's Fighter), was born from desperation in late 1944 as Germany faced overwhelming Allied air superiority. The Emergency Fighter Program called for a simple, cheap jet fighter that could be mass-produced using non-strategic materials and flown by hastily-trained pilots, including Hitler Youth members with glider experience.

Heinkel's design was astonishingly simple: a small wooden fuselage, straight wings, and a single BMW 003 turbojet mounted atop the fuselage. From specification to first flight took only 69 days, an incredible achievement. However, this haste created serious problems. Early prototypes suffered structural failures, including the crash of the first prototype on its second flight which killed Heinkel's chief test pilot.

Despite continuing technical problems - including poor handling characteristics at low speeds, structural weaknesses in the wooden airframe, and unreliable engines - production was pushed forward frantically. Underground factories and improvised workshops churned out He 162s using forced labor. About 320 were completed by war's end, but only a handful saw combat with JG 1 in April 1945. The aircraft proved difficult to fly, requiring experienced pilots despite being designed for novices. The few combat encounters showed the He 162 had potential, but it was too little, too late to affect the war's outcome.

## Notable Features

- Largely wooden construction (fuselage)
- Engine mounted on top of fuselage
- Extremely fast development (69 days to first flight)
- Tricycle landing gear
- Small, lightweight airframe
- Intended for semi-skilled pilots but required expert handling
- Innovative but flawed emergency fighter concept
- Downward-firing ejection seat in later versions
