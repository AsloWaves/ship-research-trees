## History

The Ta 152 represented the ultimate development of the Fw 190 line, designed by Kurt Tank specifically to counter high-altitude Allied bombers and the threat of high-flying reconnaissance aircraft like the Mosquito. The "H" (Höhe - height) variant was optimized for extreme altitude performance with its extended wingspan, pressurized cockpit, and specially-tuned Jumo 213E engine with three-stage supercharging.

Development of the Ta 152H was rushed, and only about 43 examples were completed before war's end. The type entered service with JG 301 in January 1945, but chronic fuel shortages, lack of spare parts, and the chaotic final months of the war meant few saw combat. Those that did demonstrated exceptional high-altitude performance, with pilots reporting the aircraft handled beautifully and could outperform any Allied fighter above 9,000 meters.

The most famous Ta 152H pilot was Oberfeldwebel Willi Reschke, who claimed 27 victories in the type during the war's final months. In one engagement, he successfully fought off four P-51 Mustangs at high altitude, showcasing the aircraft's superiority in its design envelope. However, the Ta 152H arrived too late and in too few numbers to impact the war. At lower altitudes, it offered little advantage over the Fw 190D, and Allied air superiority meant most combats occurred at medium or low altitudes where the Ta 152H's high-altitude optimization was wasted.
