## History

The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the world's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft and represented a quantum leap in aviation technology. Development began in 1938, but technical difficulties with jet engines, strategic disagreements, and Hitler's insistence on bomber capability delayed its combat debut until mid-1944, when it was too late to affect the war's outcome.

The Me 262A-1a was the primary fighter variant, designated "Schwalbe" (Swallow). Its revolutionary jet propulsion gave it a speed advantage of over 150 km/h compared to the fastest Allied piston fighters, making it nearly impossible to catch in level flight. The four 30mm cannons delivered devastating firepower, and experienced pilots could exploit the Me 262's speed to attack Allied bomber formations with relative impunity.

However, the Me 262 suffered from numerous problems: the Jumo 004 engines were unreliable with a service life of only 10-25 hours, the aircraft was vulnerable during takeoff and landing, fuel shortages limited operations, and pilot training was inadequate. Allied fighters learned to attack Me 262s during their approach to airfields when they were slow and vulnerable. Despite these limitations, the approximately 100-150 Me 262s that saw significant combat claimed over 500 Allied aircraft destroyed, demonstrating the potential of jet fighters. The type equipped several units including the elite JV 44 commanded by Adolf Galland.
