## Notes

Type Tenzan (Heavenly Mountain). Designed to replace B5N Kate. Mitsubishi MK4T Kasei 25 engine (1850hp). More powerful and faster than B5N but introduced too late and in too few numbers. Folding wings. Could carry 1x 1764lb (800kg) torpedo or equivalent bomb load. Better performance than predecessor but suffered from engine reliability issues and fuel system problems. Chronic shortage of experienced pilots by time of introduction limited effectiveness. Participated in Battle of Philippine Sea and later kamikaze operations.
