## Notes

Carrier-borne torpedo/dive bomber Ryusei (Shooting Star). Most capable IJN carrier attack aircraft. Nakajima NK9C Homare 12 engine (1825hp). Hydraulically folding wings (47ft to 26ft). Internal weapons bay. Could carry: 1x Type 91 torpedo OR conventional bombs up to 1765lbs. Powerful for carrier aircraft with 2x 20mm cannon offensive armament. Designed as B6N replacement combining torpedo and dive bombing roles. Exceptional performance but introduced too late - only 114 built including prototypes. Most operated from land bases as carrier fleet decimated by 1944. Would have been formidable if available earlier in war.
