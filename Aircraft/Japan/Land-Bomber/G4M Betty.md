## Notes

The Mitsubishi G4M was developed in response to an unprecedented 1937-1938 Imperial Japanese Navy specification calling for a twin-engine, land-based attack bomber with extraordinary range capabilities. The requirements demanded a top speed of 398 km/h and a range of 4,722 km without ordnance, or 3,700 km while carrying an 800 kg torpedo. To achieve these exceptional range requirements, Mitsubishi engineers designed an extremely lightweight aircraft with minimal crew protection - no armor plating and no self-sealing fuel tanks. This design philosophy would prove to be the aircraft's fatal flaw. The prototype first flew on October 23, 1939, with production beginning in April 1941.

The G4M "Betty" (Allied reporting name) became the most widely produced and famous bomber flown by Japan during World War II, serving in nearly every major Pacific campaign. Its combat debut came on September 13, 1940, when 27 Bettys attacked Hankow in mainland China. The aircraft achieved its greatest success on December 10, 1941, when G4M and G3M bombers sank the British battleship HMS Prince of Wales and battlecruiser HMS Repulse off Malaya - the first time capital ships actively defending themselves were sunk solely by air power. However, the aircraft's lack of protection quickly earned it grim nicknames from Japanese crews: "the flying lighter" and "the one-shot lighter" due to its propensity to ignite when hit. During the Guadalcanal campaign in August 1942, the Betty suffered catastrophic losses - 18 of 23 attacking aircraft were shot down in a single mission.

The G4M's defining characteristic was its exceptional range - exceeding 5,500 km in the G4M1 variant - achieved through radical weight-saving measures that sacrificed crew survivability. The aircraft featured an internal bomb bay without doors when loaded, and integral fuel tanks within the wing structure made it extremely vulnerable to fire. Later variants like the G4M2 and G4M3 added some armor protection and rubber-lined self-sealing fuel tanks, though these additions reduced range and performance. The aircraft's most historically significant moment came on April 18, 1943, when Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto was killed aboard a G4M shot down by American P-38 Lightnings over Bougainville. The type's final mission was peaceful: on August 19, 1945, whitewashed G4Ms with green-cross insignia carried Japanese officers to arrange surrender details.
