## Notes

The Yokosuka P1Y Ginga ("Milky Way" or "Galaxy") was developed in response to Imperial Japanese Navy specification 15-Shi, which called for an exceptionally fast bomber combining the speed of the Zero fighter with the range of the G4M Betty bomber, while also possessing dive-bombing and torpedo capabilities. The prototype first flew in August 1943, and on paper the design appeared highly promising. Powered by two Nakajima NK9C Homare 12 18-cylinder radial engines producing 1,825 hp each, the Ginga could reach 342 mph—making it the fastest Japanese bomber of the war. However, the aircraft's Homare engines proved chronically unreliable and extraordinarily difficult to maintain, forcing the Navy to delay acceptance for over a year while Yokosuka frantically implemented modifications.

Despite its late arrival and brief service life of less than six months, the P1Y earned a formidable reputation among Allied forces who knew it as "Frances." When it finally reached operational units in October 1944, over 1,100 examples were operated by more than 20 Imperial Japanese Navy squadrons from bases across China, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the Japanese home islands. The aircraft performed land-based medium bombing, torpedo bombing, and dive-bombing missions with considerable effectiveness. During the desperate final months of the war, many P1Y aircraft were employed as kamikaze weapons during the Okinawa Campaign in Operation Tan No. 2, contributing to the staggering U.S. Navy casualties of 4,300 killed and 5,400 wounded.

A specialized night-fighter variant, the P1Y2-S Kyokko ("Aurora"), was developed with AI radar and upward-firing 20mm cannons in an oblique Schräge Musik installation, plus a 30mm Type 5 cannon. Kawanishi built 96 of these night fighters, though their high-altitude performance proved inadequate against B-29 Superfortresses, leading many to be reconverted back to bombers. The Ginga represented what Japan could achieve when prioritizing speed and modern design, though its chronic engine reliability issues exemplified the industrial and material challenges facing Japanese aviation by 1944. Had the P1Y entered service a year earlier with reliable engines, it might have significantly impacted the Pacific air war.
