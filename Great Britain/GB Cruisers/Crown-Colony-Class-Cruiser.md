# Crown Colony-Class Light Cruisers (1940)

## Overview
The Crown Colony-class (also called Fiji-class) were modern light cruisers built to 1936 Second London Naval Treaty limits (8,000 tons), featuring twelve 6-inch guns in four triple turrets. Eleven ships commissioned 1940-1943, each named after British Crown colonies or Commonwealth territories. They saw extensive WWII service across all theaters with two lost (HMS Fiji at Crete 1941, HMS Trinidad Arctic 1942). Survivors served into the 1960s with several transferred to Commonwealth navies. The last three (Ceylon group) were modified with improved AA armament.

## Design Features

**1936 Second London Naval Treaty:**
- Lowered light cruiser limit from 10,000 tons to 8,000 tons
- Smaller than Town-class (11,500 tons)
- Required efficient design within treaty constraints
- Maximum firepower on reduced displacement

**Improved on Town-Class:**

- Shorter and lighter (555 ft vs 592 ft)
- Better armor distribution
- Superior range (10,100 nm vs 8,000 nm)

**Two Sub-Classes:**
1. **Fiji group** (8 ships): Standard design with 4× triple 6-inch turrets

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Class | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Crown Colony** | UK | 1940 | 8,530 tons | 31.5 kn | 12× 6" (4×3) | 2/11 lost, 9 survivors |
| Brooklyn | USA | 1937 | 10,000 tons | 32.5 kn | 15× 6" (5×3) | All survived |
| Mogami | Japan | 1935 | 11,200 tons | 35 kn | 15× 6.1" (5×3) | All sunk WWII |
| De Grasse | France | 1946 | 11,735 tons | 33 kn | 9× 6" (3×3) | Post-war completion |

**Analysis:** Crown Colony-class achieved excellent firepower and range on smallest displacement, demonstrating efficient British design within treaty limits.
