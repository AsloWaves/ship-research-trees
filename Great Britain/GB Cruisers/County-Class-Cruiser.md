# County-Class Heavy Cruisers (1928)

## Overview
The County-class were the Royal Navy's first and only 10,000-ton 8-inch gun heavy cruisers, built under Washington Naval Treaty limits. Thirteen ships in three sub-classes (Kent, London, Norfolk) served globally in WWII. They combined heavy firepower with good range but had thin armor. Several were lost to bombs/torpedoes, but survivors served into the 1950s.

- Sacrificed armor for speed and range

**Main Armament:**
- BL 8-inch Mk VIII guns
- 4 twin turrets (2 forward, 2 aft superfiring)
- 256-lb shells
- 70° elevation (anti-aircraft capable)
