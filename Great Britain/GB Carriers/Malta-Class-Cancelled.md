# Malta-Class Aircraft Carriers (Cancelled 1945)

## Overview
Malta-class were large armored fleet carriers designed 1942-1943 as successors to Illustrious-class. Four ships planned: Malta, Gibraltar, New Zealand, Africa. Designed displacement 46,900 tons with 81 aircraft - largest British carrier design to that point. Featured fully armored hangars and flight deck (like Illustrious but much larger). Two ships laid down 1942-1943 (later renamed Audacious and Irresistible, became HMS Eagle and HMS Ark Royal), two never started. War experience and budget constraints led to redesign as lighter Audacious-class 1943-1945. Malta-class name abandoned. Original armored design deemed too heavy, slow to build, and unsuited to jet aircraft. Represented end of British armored carrier philosophy - post-war carriers adopted lighter, more flexible designs.

## Design Concept - Ultimate Armored Carrier

### Illustrious-Class Philosophy Extended

**Illustrious-Class Lessons:**
- **Illustrious-class (1940):** Armored hangars and flight decks proved survivable
- Resisted bomb and kamikaze hits
- But cramped - only 36 aircraft
- Malta-class intended to fix capacity problem

**Design Goals:**
- **Retain full armor protection**
- **Massively increase aircraft capacity** (81 vs 36)
- Large enough for future aircraft development
- Flagship capability
- Post-war fleet carrier

**Largest British Carrier Design (1942):**
- 46,900 tons standard (vs 23,000 tons Illustrious)
- Double the displacement
- 81 aircraft (vs 36)
- Fully armored like Illustrious
- Attempt to have protection AND capacity

### Armored Design Features

**Full Armor Protection:**
- **Flight deck:** 4 inches armored
- **Hangar sides:** 4 inches armored
- **Belt:** 5.5 inches
- **Deck:** 4 inches
- Armored box hangar (like Illustrious)
- Protected against bombs, shells, kamikaze

**Trade-Offs:**
- Armor added massive weight
- Limited aircraft capacity growth
- Slow to build
- Very expensive
- Complex construction

## Why Malta-Class Was Abandoned

### 1. War Experience Changed Thinking (1943-1945)

**American Carrier Success:**
- **Essex-class:** 27,000 tons, unarmored, 90+ aircraft
- Proved unarmored carriers viable
- More aircraft = better defense (fighter umbrella)
- Faster to build
- More flexible

**British Experience:**
- Illustrious-class armor saved ships from kamikaze
- **But** - cramped hangars limited effectiveness
- Needed more aircraft for strike power
- Armor vs capacity trade-off reconsidered

**Pacific War Lessons:**
- American carriers effective despite no armor
- More fighters = better defense than armor
- Strike power (more aircraft) more important
- Malta's 81 aircraft still less than Essex's 90+
- Malta's armor made it heavier, slower to build

### 2. Too Heavy and Slow to Build

**Construction Time:**
- Laid down 1942-1943
- Estimated completion: 1946-1947 (4-5 years minimum)
- War likely over before completion
- Too slow for wartime needs

**Weight Problems:**
- 46,900 tons extremely heavy
- Structural challenges
- Dock facilities strained
- Very expensive to build

**Complexity:**
- Armored hangar complex to construct
- Specialized armor plating
- Difficult engineering
- Slow construction process

### 3. Unsuited to Jet Aircraft

**Jet Age Arriving:**
- By 1944-1945, jets emerging
- Jet aircraft heavier than propeller aircraft
- Need stronger catapults
- Need larger flight decks
- Armored box hangar limits flexibility

**Malta Design Limitations:**
- Fixed armored hangar height
- Limited ability to modify for jets
- Deck strength adequate but not upgradeable
- Better to design fresh for jets

### 4. Post-War Budget Cuts

**War Ending (1945):**
- VJ-Day August 1945
- Massive defense cuts
- Royal Navy budget slashed
- Could not afford four 46,900-ton carriers

**Priority Shift:**
- Finish two ships (as redesigned Audacious-class)
- Cancel two incomplete ships
- Focus on post-war economy
- Demobilization priority

### 5. Redesign as Audacious-Class

**Better Solution:**
- Lighter design (36,800 tons vs 46,900 tons)
- Reduced armor (still protected but not fully armored)
- Faster to build
- More adaptable to jets
- More economical
- Completed as HMS Eagle and HMS Ark Royal

## Redesign Process (1943-1945)

### Initial Malta Design (1942-1943)

**Original Concept:**
- 46,900 tons
- Fully armored (4-inch flight deck, 4-inch hangar)
- 81 aircraft
- Two ships laid down

### First Modifications (1943)

**Lightening Attempts:**
- Reduce armor thickness
- Reduce aircraft capacity slightly
- Improve propulsion efficiency
- Still too heavy

### Audacious-Class Emerges (1944-1945)

**Major Redesign:**
- **New class name:** Audacious-class
- **Reduced displacement:** 36,800 tons (vs 46,900 tons)
- **Reduced armor:** Light armor vs full armored box
- **Increased hangar flexibility:** Not rigid armored box
- **Better suited to jets:** Adaptable design
- **Faster construction:** Simpler structure

**Ships Renamed:**
- Malta → Audacious → HMS Eagle (R05)
- Gibraltar → Irresistible → HMS Ark Royal (R09)
- New Zealand → Cancelled (never laid down)
- Africa → Cancelled (never laid down)

### Post-War Completion (1945-1955)

**Further Delays:**
- War ended, construction slowed
- Budget cuts
- Design changes for jets
- HMS Eagle commissioned 1951 (9 years build)
- HMS Ark Royal commissioned 1955 (12 years build)

**As-Completed Specifications:**
- 36,800-43,000 tons (grew during construction)
- Angled deck, steam catapults
- 60-80 aircraft
- Far more capable than original Malta design
- Vindicated redesign decision

## What If Malta-Class Had Been Built?

### Hypothetical Malta-Class Capabilities

**If Completed As Designed (1946-1947):**

**Strengths:**
- Heavily armored (survived kamikaze/bombs)
- 81 aircraft (more than Illustrious)
- Flagship capability
- Impressive on paper

**Fatal Weaknesses:**
- **Too heavy:** 46,900 tons difficult to operate
- **Too slow to build:** Completed after war
- **Obsolete at birth:** Not designed for jets
- **Inflexible:** Armored box hangar limits modification
- **Too expensive:** Could only afford 2, not 4
- **Less capable than Essex:** Despite armor, fewer aircraft than American carriers

**Likely Fate:**
- If completed 1946-1947, immediately obsolescent
- Jets emerging, Malta not suited
- Would require immediate expensive refit
- Probably scrapped 1950s-1960s without much service
- Waste of resources
- Vindication of redesign decision

### Why Audacious Design Better

**Audacious Advantages:**
- **Lighter:** 36,800 tons easier to build/operate
- **Adaptable:** Could be modified for jets (and were)
- **Economical:** Cheaper to build
- **Practical:** Better suited to post-war reality
- **Long service:** Both ships served 21-23 years
- **Phantom capable:** Ark Royal extensively modernized

**Result:**
- Malta design would have been disaster
- Audacious redesign vindicated
- Both Eagle and Ark Royal served well
- Right decision made

## Comparison - Malta vs Audacious vs American Carriers

| Design | Displacement | Aircraft | Armor | Speed | Built | Fate |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Malta (designed)** | 46,900 tons | 81 | Full (4" deck) | 32 kn | 0 | Redesigned |
| **Audacious (as built)** | 36,800-43,000 tons | 60-80 | Light | 31.5 kn | 2 | Served 1951-1978 |
| **Illustrious-class** | 23,000 tons | 36 | Full (3" deck) | 30.5 kn | 6 | Served 1940-1960s |
| **Essex-class** | 27,100 tons | 90-100 | None | 33 kn | 24 | Many served to 1990s |
| **Midway-class** | 45,000 tons | 130+ | Partial | 33 kn | 3 | Served to 1992 |

**Analysis:** Malta represented British commitment to armored carriers but was impractical. Audacious-class lighter, more flexible design proved far superior. American unarmored but larger carriers (Essex/Midway) proved most successful approach.

## Legacy

**End of Armored Carrier Philosophy:**
- Malta last attempt at fully armored carrier
- Redesign to Audacious marked shift
- Post-war carriers emphasized flexibility over protection
- Armor vs capacity debate resolved: capacity wins

**Influence on Audacious-Class:**
- Malta design work not wasted
- Hull form and propulsion influenced Audacious
- Lessons learned applied
- Better final product

**Largest British Design Until Queen Elizabeth:**
- 46,900 tons not exceeded until Invincible (22,000 tons much smaller)
- Queen Elizabeth-class (65,000 tons) finally exceeded Malta
- Shows ambition of 1942 planners

**Vindication of Redesign:**
- Eagle and Ark Royal served well
- Could operate jets (after modernization)
- Lasted 21-23 years
- Malta design would have been obsolete
- Right decision made

**Historical Significance:**
- Represents peak and end of British armored carrier philosophy
- Transition from WWII to jet age
- Budget reality vs design ambition
- Lesson in adaptability

**"What Might Have Been":**
- Popular subject for naval historians
- Shows path not taken
- Demonstrates wisdom of design flexibility
- Cautionary tale of over-specification

## Why Armored Carriers Faded

**British Armored Carrier Experience:**
- **Advantages:** Survived kamikaze, bomb hits
- **Disadvantages:** Limited aircraft capacity, inflexible, heavy, expensive

**American Unarmored Carrier Experience:**
- **Advantages:** More aircraft, flexible, cheaper, easier to build
- **Disadvantages:** Vulnerable to damage

**Resolution:**
- **American approach won:** More aircraft = better defense
- Fighter umbrella > armored deck
- Strike power > passive protection
- Flexibility > rigid protection
- Post-war carriers worldwide adopted American philosophy

**Malta represented last gasp of British armored philosophy before reality set in.**

## Comparison to Contemporary Cancelled Designs

| Cancelled Carrier | Nation | Year | Type | Displacement | Aircraft | Why Cancelled |
|-------------------|--------|------|------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Malta-class** | UK | 1945 | Armored fleet | 46,900 tons | 81 | Redesigned (too heavy, unsuited to jets) |
| United States (CVA-58) | USA | 1949 | Supercarrier | 65,000 tons | 100+ | Inter-service politics ("Revolt of Admirals") |
| CVA-01 | UK | 1966 | Fleet carrier | 54,000 tons | 50+ | Political decision (Labour government) |
| Ulyanovsk | USSR | 1991 | Supercarrier | 75,000 tons | 70+ | Soviet collapse |

**Analysis:** Malta cancelled for practical reasons (unsuitable design). CVA-01 cancelled for political reasons (mistake). United States cancelled for politics. Ulyanovsk cancelled by Soviet collapse.
