# HMS Eagle - Aircraft Carrier (1924)

## Overview
HMS Eagle was originally the Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre, purchased by Britain during WWI and extensively converted into an aircraft carrier. Originally laid down 1913 for Chile, purchased 1918, converted 1918-1924, and commissioned as carrier February 1924 - same month as HMS Hermes. Unlike Hermes (10,850 tons), Eagle was much larger (22,600 tons, 21-30 aircraft) and represented conversion of existing battleship hull rather than purpose-built design. Featured island superstructure on starboard side like Hermes. Served Mediterranean Fleet throughout 1920s-1930s. WWII service: Force H operations, Malta convoys. Sunk 11 August 1942 by U-73 (four torpedoes) during Operation Pedestal - critical Malta relief convoy. 160 killed, 927 survivors rescued by destroyers. One of two British carriers lost to U-boats (with Courageous).

## Origin - Chilean Battleship Almirante Latorre

**Original Order:**
- Ordered by Chile from Armstrong Whitworth, Elswick
- Part of Chilean naval expansion pre-WWI
- Sister ship: Almirante Cochrane (also purchased by RN, became HMS Eagle's contemporary)
- **Laid down:** 21 February 1913
- **Launched:** 28 November 1913 (as Almirante Latorre)
- Dreadnought-type battleship design

**Battleship Specifications (Original Design):**
- 28,000 tons
- 10× 14-inch guns (5 twin turrets)
- 14× 6-inch secondary guns
- 23 knots
- Armstrong Whitworth design

**WWI Interruption:**
- August 1914: WWI outbreak
- Chile unable to pay for ship
- Britain desperately needed battleships
- **September 1914:** Purchased by Royal Navy
- Completed as **HMS Canada** (battleship)
- Commissioned September 1915
- Served Grand Fleet 1915-1918

**HMS Canada Service:**
- Assigned to 4th Battle Squadron
- North Sea operations
- No major battles
- Returned to Chile 1920 as **Almirante Latorre**
- Served Chilean Navy until 1958
- Scrapped 1959 in Japan

**Note:** HMS Eagle was NOT the battleship Canada, but was originally intended to be the SECOND Chilean battleship Almirante Cochrane. The ships' identities are often confused.

## Correction: HMS Eagle Origin

**Actually:** HMS Eagle was originally **Almirante Cochrane** (sister ship), NOT Almirante Latorre.

**Correct History:**
- Ordered by Chile as **Almirante Cochrane**
- **Laid down:** 20 February 1913
- **Launched:** incomplete during WWI
- **Purchased by RN:** 28 February 1918
- Never completed as battleship
- Directly converted to aircraft carrier on slipway
- More extensive conversion than if completed as battleship first

## Conversion to Aircraft Carrier (1918-1924)

**Purchase Decision (1918):**
- HMS Argus and Furious proved carrier concept
- Royal Navy wanted more carriers
- Almirante Cochrane hull available
- Cheaper than building new carrier
- Decision made to convert incomplete battleship

**Conversion Work (1918-1924):**
- Armstrong Whitworth, Newcastle
- Hull lengthened slightly
- Complete internal restructuring
- Two hangars installed
- Flight deck added
- Funnels redesigned
- Island superstructure added (starboard)
- **6 years conversion** (vs ~4 years if purpose-built)

**Design Features Added:**

**Flight Deck:**
- **652 feet long × 105 feet wide**
- Full-length continuous deck
- Longitudinal arrestor wires
- Wooden deck on steel structure
- Larger than Hermes (570 ft)

**Hangars:**
- **Upper hangar:** 400 feet long
- **Lower hangar:** 330 feet long
- Two-hangar configuration
- More capacity than Hermes (single hangar)
- Aircraft maintenance facilities

**Island Superstructure:**
- Offset to starboard (like Hermes)
- Bridge and navigation
- Two funnels on island
- Flight control position
- Standard carrier configuration

**Aircraft Lifts:**
- Two lifts (forward and aft)
- Connected hangars to flight deck
- Hydraulically operated
- Standard two-lift design

**Commissioned:** 20 February 1924 (same month as Hermes)

## Comparison to HMS Hermes

| Feature | HMS Hermes | HMS Eagle |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Origin** | Purpose-built | Converted battleship |
| **Displacement** | 10,850 tons | 22,600 tons |
| **Flight Deck** | 570 ft × 70 ft | 652 ft × 105 ft |
| **Hangars** | 1 (400 ft) | 2 (400 ft + 330 ft) |
| **Aircraft** | 20-24 | 21-30 |
| **Speed** | 25 knots | 24 knots |
| **Island** | Yes (starboard) | Yes (starboard) |
| **Commissioned** | 18 Feb 1924 | 20 Feb 1924 |
| **Fate** | Sunk 1942 (air attack) | Sunk 1942 (U-boat) |

**Analysis:** Eagle larger and more capable than Hermes, but both commissioned same month. Hermes was pioneer; Eagle was practical workhorse.

- Multiple successful deliveries
- Malta's lifeline

**Ferry Operations:**
- Load fighters at Gibraltar
- Steam toward Malta
- Fly off within range
- Return to Gibraltar

- Desperate but effective

### Operation Pedestal (August 1942)

**Most Important Malta Convoy:**
- August 1942: Malta nearly starved
- Massive convoy attempt
- 14 merchant ships (including SS Ohio tanker)
- Heavy escort including carriers

**Eagle's Role:**
- One of four carriers (Eagle, Victorious, Indomitable, Furious)

- Fighter protection
- Anti-submarine patrols

**Composition of Force:**
- 4 aircraft carriers
- 2 battleships (Nelson, Rodney)
- 7 cruisers
- 32 destroyers

- Largest operation of its kind

## Sinking by U-73 (11 August 1942)

### The Attack - 1315 Hours, 11 August 1942

**Location:**
- North of Algiers
- Mediterranean Sea
- About 200 miles from Malta
- Operation Pedestal in progress

**U-73 (Kapitänleutnant Helmut Rosenbaum):**
- German Type VIIB submarine
- Penetrated destroyer screen
- Perfect firing position
- Eagle turning into wind for air operations

**The Torpedoes:**
- **1315 Hours:** U-73 fired salvo of 4 torpedoes
- **All four torpedoes hit** starboard side
- Spread along length of ship
- Catastrophic damage
- Massive flooding

**Damage:**
- Four simultaneous torpedo hits
- Starboard side ripped open
- Boiler rooms flooded
- Engine rooms flooded
- Immediate heavy list to port
- No watertight integrity

### Sinking - 8 Minutes

**Rapid Flooding:**
- **1315:** Torpedoed
- Immediate 10° list to port
- List increased rapidly
- 20° within 3 minutes
- 30° within 5 minutes

**Captain's Decision:**
- Captain L.D. Mackintosh ordered abandon ship
- Only minutes available
- Crew responded quickly
- Orderly evacuation
- Aircraft on deck slid off

**1323 Hours - Capsized:**
- **Only 8 minutes after torpedo hits**
- Rolled over to port
- Capsized completely
- Sank rapidly
- One of fastest carrier sinkings
- Faster than Hermes (15 minutes)

**Aircraft:**
- 16 aircraft aboard
- All lost with ship
- Some pilots in cockpits
- Others on flight deck
- Slid into sea as ship rolled

### Rescue Operations

**Destroyers to Rescue:**
- HMS Lookout
- HMS Laforey
- Picked up survivors
- Fast rescue (U-boat danger)
- Excellent work by crews

**Casualties:**
- **160 killed** (out of 1,160 total crew)
- **927 survivors** rescued
- 86% survival rate (relatively good)
- Fast sinking but orderly evacuation
- Credit to crew discipline

**Why Survival Rate Was Good:**
- Calm seas
- Daylight attack
- Destroyers nearby
- Crew well-trained
- 8 minutes enough for most to escape
- Ship capsized rather than exploding

### Operation Pedestal Continues

**Impact on Operation:**
- Eagle sunk, but operation continued
- Three carriers remained (Victorious, Indomitable, Furious)
- Reduced air cover
- But mission pressed on

**Pedestal Outcome:**
- 5 of 14 merchant ships reached Malta
- Including SS Ohio (tanker) - barely
- Malta saved from starvation
- Strategic success despite losses
- Eagle's sacrifice contributed to Malta's survival

## Why Eagle Was Sunk

**Vulnerability:**
- Older carrier design (1924)
- Limited anti-torpedo protection
- Converted battleship hull = weak underwater protection
- No bulges or blisters
- Four torpedo hits overwhelming

**U-Boat Penetration:**
- U-73 skillful
- Penetrated destroyer screen
- Eagle turning into wind = predictable course
- Perfect setup for U-boat
- Destroyers couldn't stop it

**Bad Luck:**
- All four torpedoes hit (unusual)
- Spread along length = maximum damage
- Hit during flight operations
- Caught vulnerable

**Design Flaw:**
- Converted battleship hulls poor against torpedoes
- Purpose-built carriers had better protection
- Eagle's battleship origin a weakness
- Illustrious-class had better underwater protection

## Wreck

**Location:**
- North of Algiers, Mediterranean
- 36°47′N 3°34′E
- Depth: ~1,000 meters (deep)
- War grave

**Discovery:**
- Wreck located by survey teams
- Upright on seabed
- Well-preserved due to depth
- Protected site

**War Grave:**
- 160 men entombed
- Designated war grave
- Diving prohibited
- Protected under military remains protection

## Legacy

**Converted Battleship Carrier:**
- Proved conversion concept viable
- But limitations showed
- Purpose-built carriers better
- Conversion economical but compromised

**Contemporary of Hermes:**
- Both commissioned February 1924
- Both sunk 1942
- Hermes by air attack, Eagle by U-boat
- Both lost defending critical operations

**Malta Lifeline:**
- Ferry missions critical
- Delivered hundreds of fighters
- Malta's survival partially due to Eagle
- Sacrifice during Pedestal honored

**Operation Pedestal:**
- Eagle's loss didn't stop operation
- Malta saved despite carrier sunk
- Demonstrated resilience of convoy system
- Eagle's crew contributed to victory

**U-Boat Victim:**
- One of two British fleet carriers sunk by U-boats
- HMS Courageous (September 1939) - first
- HMS Eagle (August 1942) - second
- Demonstrated U-boat threat to carriers

**Fastest Carrier Sinking:**
- 8 minutes from torpedo hit to capsized
- Faster than most carriers
- Demonstrated vulnerability
- But high survival rate (86%)

**Chilean Connection:**
- Originally Chilean battleship
- Never served Chile (purchased incomplete)
- Sister ship Almirante Latorre served Chile 1920-1958
- Interesting international history

## Comparison to Contemporary Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Origin | Displacement | Aircraft | Speed | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|--------|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| **Eagle** | UK | 1924 | Converted BB (Chilean) | 22,600 tons | 21-30 | 24 kn | Sunk 1942 (U-boat) |
| Hermes | UK | 1924 | Purpose-built | 10,850 tons | 20-24 | 25 kn | Sunk 1942 (air attack) |
| Furious | UK | 1925 | Converted BC | 22,890 tons | 33-36 | 31.5 kn | Scrapped 1948 |
| Hosho | Japan | 1922 | Purpose-built | 7,470 tons | 21 | 25 kn | Scrapped 1947 |
| Langley | USA | 1922 | Converted collier | 11,500 tons | 34 | 15.5 kn | Sunk 1942 |
| Béarn | France | 1927 | Converted BB | 22,146 tons | 40 | 21.5 kn | Scrapped 1967 |

**Analysis:** Eagle typical of 1920s conversions - larger than purpose-built but compromised by conversion limitations.

## Aircraft Operated

**Interwar (1924-1939):**
- Fairey Flycatcher (fighter)
- Fairey IIIF (reconnaissance)
- Blackburn Ripon (torpedo bomber)
- Blackburn Dart (torpedo bomber)
