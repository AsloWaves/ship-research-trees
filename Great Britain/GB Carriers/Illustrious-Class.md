# Illustrious-Class Aircraft Carriers (1940)

## Overview
The Illustrious-class were revolutionary armored aircraft carriers featuring a 3-inch armored flight deck - the first carriers designed to survive bomb and shell hits. This armor came at the cost of aircraft capacity (36 vs 70+ on US carriers), but proved its worth when ships survived multiple bomb hits that would have sunk unarmored carriers. Four ships served extensively in WWII across all theaters.

## Revolutionary Armored Design

**Armored Flight Deck:**
- 3-inch armored flight deck (revolutionary)
- 4.5-inch armored hangar sides and bulkheads
- Designed to resist 500-lb bombs and 6-inch shells
- Armor formed integral "armored box" protecting hangar
- Weighed 1,500 tons (62% of flight deck area)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Advantage:** Survived multiple bomb hits
- **Disadvantage:** Reduced aircraft capacity (36 vs 70+ on US carriers)
- **Philosophy:** Quality over quantity, survivability over numbers

**Comparison to US Carriers:**
| Feature | Illustrious-Class | USS Enterprise |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Flight deck armor | 3 inches | None (wood planking) |
| Hangar armor | 4.5 inches sides | None (open hangar) |
| Aircraft capacity | 36 aircraft | 90 aircraft |
| Bomb survival | Multiple hits | Vulnerable |

- **Famous Action:** Taranto Raid - launched Swordfish that crippled Italian fleet
- **Damage:** Survived 6 bomb hits (January 1941) thanks to armor
- **Fate:** Scrapped 1956

### 2. HMS Formidable (67)
- **Commissioned:** 24 November 1940
- **Service:** Mediterranean, Battle of Cape Matapan (1941), Indian Ocean, Pacific Fleet

## Service History

### Attack on Taranto (11 November 1940)

HMS Illustrious's most famous operation:
- Launched 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers
- Attacked Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto harbor
- Sank/damaged 3 battleships (half the Italian battle fleet)
- Changed naval warfare - proved carriers could strike harbors
- Inspired Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941)

### Mediterranean (1940-1943)

**Malta Convoys:**
- All four ships escorted convoys to Malta
- Provided air cover against Italian/German attacks
- Critical to Malta's survival

**Damage and Survival:**
- **Illustrious (Jan 1941):** 6 bomb hits from Stukas, survived thanks to armored deck
- **Formidable:** Multiple bomb hits, survived
- **Indomitable:** Bomb hits, survived
- **Armor proved its worth** - unarmored carriers would have sunk

### Indian Ocean / Eastern Fleet (1942-1944)

- All four served in Eastern Fleet
- Operations against Japanese forces
- Carrier raids on Japanese-held territory
- Supported amphibious operations

### British Pacific Fleet (1945)

**All Four Carriers Served:**
- Joined US Pacific Fleet for final assault on Japan
- Illustrious, Formidable, Victorious, Indomitable all present
- **Kamikaze attacks:** Armored decks proved invaluable
  - US carriers: Wooden decks pierced, serious damage
  - British carriers: Armor deflected kamikazes, minor damage
  - US comment: "When a kamikaze hits a US carrier, it's 6 months' repair. When it hits a Brit carrier, it's 'Sweepers, man your brooms!'"

## Legacy

**Armored Flight Deck Concept:**
- Proved survivability worth reduced capacity
- Influenced British carrier design through 1970s
- US Navy continued with unarmored decks (more aircraft priority)

**WWII Service:**
- Most successful British carriers
- All four survived the war
- Extensive combat across all theaters
- Proved armored carrier concept

**Post-WWII:**
- Victorious extensively modernized (1950s)
- Served into jet age
- Others scrapped 1955-1956
- Design influenced future British carriers
