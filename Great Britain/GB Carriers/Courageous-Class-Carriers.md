# Courageous-Class Aircraft Carriers (1928)

## Overview
Courageous-class carriers were conversions of Fisher's "large light cruisers" (lightly-armored battlecruisers) built for the cancelled Baltic Project. Originally completed 1917 with 4× 15-inch guns and 32-knot speed, HMS Courageous and HMS Glorious were converted to aircraft carriers 1924-1928. As carriers they displaced ~22,500 tons with 48 aircraft capacity and retained excellent 30+ knot speed - fastest British carriers until modern era. Both ships met tragic fates in WWII: Courageous torpedoed by U-29 on 17 September 1939 (519 killed) - first British carrier lost in WWII. Glorious sunk by battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 8 June 1940 off Norway (1,207-1,474 killed) - worst British carrier disaster ever. Third sister HMS Furious also converted but different configuration.

## Origin - "Large Light Cruisers" for Baltic Project

### Original Battlecruiser Design (1915-1917)

**Fisher's Baltic Project:**
- Admiral Fisher's scheme to invade Baltic
- Land army 90 miles from Berlin
- Required shallow-draft, fast, heavily-armed ships
- "Large light cruisers" classification to bypass Naval Staff opposition
- Really lightly-armored battlecruisers

**Original Specifications (As Built 1917):**
- **Displacement:** 19,320 tons (light for battlecruiser)
- **Armament:** 4× 15-inch/42 cal guns (2 twin turrets)
- **Secondary:** 18× 4-inch guns
- **Speed:** 32 knots (very fast)
- **Armor:** Minimal (2-3 inches belt) - "speed is armor"
- **Dangerously under-protected**

**Construction:**
- HMS Courageous: Laid down 28 March 1915, launched 5 February 1916, completed 4 January 1917
- HMS Glorious: Laid down 1 May 1915, launched 20 April 1916, completed 13 January 1917
- Armstrong Whitworth (Courageous) and Harland & Wolff (Glorious)

**Baltic Project Cancelled:**
- Never executed (too risky)
- Dardanelles disaster showed danger
- Ships had no clear role
- Dubious tactical value

### WWI Service as Battlecruisers (1917-1919)

**Limited Service:**
- Grand Fleet assignment
- Too lightly armored for fleet actions
- Kept away from German capital ships
- North Sea patrols
- No major battles

**First Battle of Heligoland Bight (17 November 1917):**
- Courageous and Glorious participated
- Engaged German cruisers
- Inconclusive action
- Demonstrated questionable value

**Assessment:**
- Too weak to fight battleships
- Too large to hunt cruisers
- "White elephants" of Royal Navy
- Perfect candidates for conversion

## Conversion to Aircraft Carriers (1924-1928/1930)

### Decision to Convert (1920s)

**Why Convert:**
- Ships had no useful role as battlecruisers
- Carriers desperately needed
- Fast hulls perfect for carriers
- Speed more valuable than armor for carrier
- Cheaper than scrapping and building new

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Limited battleship/battlecruiser tonnage
- Allowed carrier conversions
- Royal Navy selected Courageous and Glorious
- Furious also retained

### Conversion Work

**HMS Courageous Conversion (1924-1928):**
- June 1924: Entered dockyard
- Complete internal restructuring
- All guns removed
- Flight deck added
- Island superstructure (starboard)
- Two hangars
- Two lifts
- **May 1928:** Recommissioned as carrier

**HMS Glorious Conversion (1924-1930):**
- Similar conversion to Courageous
- Started slightly later
- Slightly different details
- **February 1930:** Recommissioned as carrier

**Design Features:**

**Flight Deck:**
- **570 feet long × 95 feet wide**
- Full-length continuous deck
- Longitudinal arrestor wires
- Larger than Hermes, similar to Eagle/Furious
- Wooden deck on steel structure

**Hangars:**
- **Upper hangar:** 460 feet long
- **Lower hangar:** 420 feet long
- Two-hangar configuration
- Large capacity: **48 aircraft** (excellent for 1920s)
- More than any British carrier except later Ark Royal

**Island Superstructure:**
- Small island offset to starboard
- Two funnels on island (later combined into one)
- Bridge and flight control
- Compact design
- Standard configuration

**Speed Retained:**
- **30.5 knots** - excellent for carrier
- Fastest British carriers until post-WWII
- Could keep up with cruisers
- Perfect for fast carrier operations
- Major advantage over slower carriers

**Weaknesses:**
- **Minimal armor** (3-2 inch belt)
- Battlecruiser hull = weak protection
- Vulnerable to torpedoes
- Vulnerable to gunfire
- Both fatal flaws would be exploited

## Interwar Service (1928-1939)

### HMS Courageous (1928-1939)

**Fleet Service:**
- Home Fleet carrier
- Atlantic and Mediterranean
- Fleet exercises
- Carrier aviation development
- Training platform

**Aircraft Operated:**
- Fairey Flycatcher fighters
- Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers
- Fairey IIIF reconnaissance
- Later: Hawker Nimrod, Osprey
- Fairey Swordfish by 1939

### HMS Glorious (1930-1939)

**Fleet Service:**
- Similar to Courageous
- Mediterranean Fleet
- China Station (mid-1930s)
- Home Fleet by 1939
- Training and exercises

**Modifications (Both Ships):**
- AA armament increased throughout 1930s
- Fire control improved
- Arrestor gear updated
- Radar fitted (late 1930s)
- But fundamentally unmodernized

## WWII Service & Losses

### HMS Courageous - First Carrier Loss (17 September 1939)

#### Anti-Submarine Patrols (September 1939)

**Controversial Deployment:**
- September 1939: Early weeks of WWII
- Admiralty deployed carriers for anti-submarine patrols
- **Misuse of carriers** - vulnerable to submarines
- Courageous assigned to Western Approaches
- Hunting U-boats west of Ireland

**Mission:**
- Search for U-boats
- Protect convoys
- Launch Swordfish patrols
- But carriers vulnerable to the very submarines they hunted

#### The Attack - 17 September 1939

**U-29 (Kapitänleutnant Otto Schuhart):**
- Type VIIA U-boat
- Spotted Courageous at 1950 hours
- Perfect firing position
- Courageous conducting flying operations

**1950 Hours - Torpedoed:**
- U-29 fired three torpedoes
- **Two torpedoes hit** port side
- Massive explosions
- Boiler rooms flooded
- Immediate heavy list

**Sinking:**
- Heavy list to port
- Ship losing power
- Order to abandon ship
- **20 minutes from hit to sinking**
- Capsized and sank
- 500 miles west of Land's End

**Casualties:**
- **519 killed** (out of 1,260 crew)
- **741 survivors** rescued by escorts
- 41% fatality rate
- Many trapped below decks
- First British aircraft carrier lost in combat

**Destroyers Lost:**
- HMS Courageous escorted by 4 destroyers
- During rescue operations, destroyers exposed
- No additional ships lost during rescue
- But U-boat threat demonstrated

**Strategic Impact:**
- **Immediate end to carrier anti-submarine patrols**
- Carriers recognized as too valuable and vulnerable
- Changed Royal Navy carrier doctrine
- Never again used carriers for ASW patrols
- Painful lesson learned early

### HMS Glorious - Worst British Carrier Disaster (8 June 1940)

#### Norwegian Campaign (April-June 1940)

**Glorious in Norway:**
- Supported Norwegian campaign
- Launched air strikes
- Covered evacuations
- Successfully evacuated RAF Hurricanes and Gladiators
- **First time modern monoplane fighters landed on carrier**

**Historic Achievement:**
- 7-8 June 1940: Evacuated RAF aircraft from Norway
- 10× Hawker Hurricane fighters
- 8× Gloster Gladiator fighters
- First time Hurricanes landed on carrier (no tail hooks!)
- Pilots had never done carrier landings
- Extraordinary feat

**Departure from Norway:**
- 8 June 1940: Ordered to return to UK
- Detached from main fleet
- Only two destroyer escorts (Ardent, Acasta)
- **Captain d'Oyly-Hughes detached without permission**
- Wanted to reach Scutari for court-martial (crew discipline issue)
- Fatal decision

#### The Battle - 8 June 1940, 1600 Hours

**German Battleships:**
- **Scharnhorst** and **Gneisenau**
- Returning from Norway operation
- Spotted Glorious at 1600 hours
- Perfect opportunity

**1600 Hours - Spotted:**
- Glorious had no aircraft on patrol (inexplicable)
- No combat air patrol (CAP)
- No reconnaissance aircraft aloft
- Completely surprised
- Range: 28,000 yards

**1632 Hours - First Hits:**
- Scharnhorst opened fire at 26,000 yards
- **Third salvo hit Glorious**
- 11-inch shell hit flight deck
- Wrecked flight deck, impossible to launch aircraft
- Glorious helpless

**The Slaughter:**
- Glorious couldn't launch aircraft
- Two destroyers laid smoke
- Glorious tried to escape (30 knots)
- German battleships faster (31+ knots)
- Continuous hits

**Destroyer Heroism:**
- **HMS Acasta** attacked with torpedoes
- Hit Scharnhorst (damaged but not fatal)
- Acasta sunk by gunfire
- **HMS Ardent** also attacked
- Ardent sunk by gunfire
- Both destroyers fought to the end

**Glorious Hit Repeatedly:**
- Dozens of 11-inch hits
- Flight deck wrecked
- Fires throughout
- Listing heavily
- Engines damaged
- Dead in water

**1820 Hours - Sinking:**
- Glorious capsized
- Sank in Norwegian Sea
- German ships withdrew (Scharnhorst damaged)
- No rescue attempted by Germans
- Survivors in freezing water

#### The Aftermath - Rescue Failure

**No Immediate Rescue:**
- Main fleet unaware of sinking
- Radio silence maintained
- Glorious didn't send distress call (damage to transmitters)
- No one knew ships were sunk
- Survivors adrift for days

**43 Hours in Water:**
- Survivors in lifeboats and rafts
- North Atlantic in June (still cold)
- Hypothermia, exposure
- Many died waiting
- Norwegian ship eventually found survivors

**Casualties - Worst British Carrier Disaster:**
- **Glorious:** 1,207-1,474 killed (sources vary)
- Only **40-45 survivors** from Glorious (out of 1,200+)
- **HMS Acasta:** 160 killed, 1 survivor
- **HMS Ardent:** 152 killed, 2 survivors
- **Total: ~1,519-1,786 killed, ~43-48 survivors**
- **97%+ fatality rate**
- Worst British carrier loss ever

### Why Glorious Was Lost

**No Air Patrols:**
- Inexplicable failure to launch reconnaissance
- No combat air patrol (CAP)
- Could have spotted Germans hours earlier
- Aircraft could have attacked
- Fatal error

**Detached from Fleet:**
- Captain d'Oyly-Hughes left main force
- Only two destroyer escorts
- Should have stayed with fleet
- Isolated and vulnerable
- Questionable judgment

**Aircraft Couldn't Launch:**
- First hit wrecked flight deck
- 18 Hurricanes and Gladiators aboard
- All lost without launching
- If launched might have damaged Germans
- But deck hit immediately

**Weak Armor:**
- Converted battlecruiser = minimal protection
- 11-inch shells penetrated easily
- Fires spread rapidly
- No resistance to battleship gunfire
- Design flaw fatal

**German Gunnery:**
- Excellent gunnery by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau
- Long-range hits
- Scharnhorst hit Glorious at 26,000 yards (13 miles)
- One of longest-range naval gunfire hits
- Glorious had no chance

**No Distress Call:**
- Radio damage prevented distress
- Fleet didn't know Glorious sunk
- No rescue for 43 hours
- Most deaths from exposure after sinking
- Rescue failure compounded disaster

## Comparison - Two Sisters, Two Tragedies

| Feature | HMS Courageous | HMS Glorious |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Sunk** | 17 Sep 1939 | 8 Jun 1940 |
| **Cause** | Torpedoed by U-29 | Sunk by battleships Scharnhorst & Gneisenau |
| **Location** | Western Approaches | Norwegian Sea |
| **Sinking Time** | 20 minutes | ~2 hours |
| **Crew** | 1,260 | 1,200+ |
| **Killed** | 519 (41%) | 1,207-1,474 (97%+) |
| **Survivors** | 741 | 40-45 |
| **Lesson** | Don't use carriers for ASW | Maintain air patrols, stay with fleet |

**Analysis:** Both ships lost due to misuse and design vulnerabilities. Courageous' loss ended carrier ASW patrols. Glorious' loss was preventable disaster - worst British carrier catastrophe.

## Legacy

**Fastest British Carriers (Interwar):**
- 30.5 knots - excellent speed
- Only carriers to match cruiser speed
- Ideal for fast carrier operations
- Speed advantage clear

**Successful Conversions:**
- Proved battlecruiser-to-carrier conversion viable
- 48 aircraft capacity excellent
- Better than purpose-built Hermes
- Cost-effective use of obsolete battlecruisers

**Two Tragic Losses:**
- Courageous: First British carrier lost in combat
- Glorious: Worst British carrier disaster ever
- Combined: 1,726-1,993 killed
- Enormous loss of life and capability

**Lessons Learned:**

**From Courageous:**
- Carriers too vulnerable for anti-submarine patrols
- Changed Royal Navy doctrine immediately
- Carriers recognized as too valuable to risk
- Dedicated ASW carriers developed later (escort carriers)

**From Glorious:**
- Always maintain air patrols
- Never detach from fleet without good reason
- Carriers need protection
- One mistake can be fatal
- Speed not enough without awareness

**Hurricane Carrier Landings:**
- Glorious achieved historic first
- Proved monoplane fighters could land on carriers
- Led to Sea Hurricane development
- Demonstrated carrier flexibility
- Silver lining to tragedy

**Converted Battlecruiser Weakness:**
- Both ships sunk due to weak protection
- Torpedoes (Courageous) and shells (Glorious) penetrated easily
- Showed limits of conversions
- Influenced future carrier designs
- Armored carriers (Illustrious-class) became priority

**Memorial:**
- 1,726-1,993 men lost on two ships
- Memorials at Portsmouth and elsewhere
- War graves protected
- Remembered as tragic losses
- Lessons learned in their sacrifice

## Comparison to Other Early Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Origin | Displacement | Aircraft | Speed | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|--------|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| **Courageous** | UK | 1928 | Converted BC | 22,500 tons | 48 | 30.5 kn | Torpedoed 1939 |
| **Glorious** | UK | 1930 | Converted BC | 22,500 tons | 48 | 30.5 kn | Gunfire 1940 |
| Furious | UK | 1925 | Converted BC | 22,890 tons | 33-36 | 31.5 kn | Scrapped 1948 |
| Eagle | UK | 1924 | Converted BB | 22,600 tons | 21-30 | 24 kn | Torpedoed 1942 |
| Hermes | UK | 1924 | Purpose-built | 10,850 tons | 20-24 | 25 kn | Air attack 1942 |
| Lexington | USA | 1927 | Converted BC | 36,000 tons | 78 | 33.25 kn | Torpedoed 1942 |
| Akagi | Japan | 1927 | Converted BC | 36,500 tons | 66 | 31 kn | Bombed 1942 |

**Analysis:** Courageous-class excellent carrier conversions - large aircraft capacity, high speed. But weak protection led to both ships' destruction.

## Aircraft Operated

**Interwar (1928-1939):**
- Fairey Flycatcher (fighter)
- Hawker Nimrod (fighter)
- Hawker Osprey (fighter-reconnaissance)
- Blackburn Ripon (torpedo bomber)
- Blackburn Baffin (torpedo bomber)
- Fairey Swordfish (torpedo bomber)

**Courageous at Sinking (Sep 1939):**
- 12× Fairey Swordfish
- All lost with ship

**Glorious at Sinking (Jun 1940):**
- 10× RAF Hawker Hurricane (just embarked from Norway)
- 8× RAF Gloster Gladiator (just embarked from Norway)
