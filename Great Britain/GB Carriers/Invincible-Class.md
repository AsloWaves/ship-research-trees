# Invincible-Class Aircraft Carriers (1980)

## Overview
The Invincible-class were light aircraft carriers designed as Cold War anti-submarine warfare platforms, featuring the innovative ski-jump ramp for Sea Harrier V/STOL operations. Three ships served 1980-2014: HMS Invincible (flagship Falklands War), HMS Illustrious, and HMS Ark Royal. They pioneered the ski-jump concept now used worldwide and proved carrier aviation's continued relevance. Replaced by much larger Queen Elizabeth-class supercarriers.

## Revolutionary Ski-Jump Design

**World's First Ski-Jump Carriers:**
- 7° ski-jump on Invincible & Illustrious
- 12° ski-jump on Ark Royal
- Increased Harrier payload and safety
- First operational use: 30 October 1980

**Ski-Jump Advantages:**
- Increased take-off weight by 2,000+ lbs
- Shorter take-off run required
- Greater safety margin
- Allowed heavier weapons/fuel loads

**Global Influence:**
- Concept adopted worldwide
- Used by: India, China, Spain, Thailand, Italy
- Queen Elizabeth-class uses 12.5° ski-jump
- Most successful British naval innovation post-WWII

## Design Features

**Light Carrier Concept:**
- 20,000 tons (1/3 size of US supercarriers)
- Designed for ASW primary role
- Sea Harrier for fleet defense
- Through-deck cruiser designation initially (political)

**Flight Deck:**
- 550 ft long × 55 ft wide
- Ski-jump at bow
- 2 aircraft lifts
- V/STOL operations only (no catapults/arresting gear)

**Hangar:**
- 500 ft long
- 20 ft height
- Stored aircraft and helicopters

## Ships of the Class

### 1. HMS Invincible (R05)
- **Built:** Vickers, 1973-1980
- **Commissioned:** 11 July 1980
- **Service:** Falklands War flagship (1982), Gulf War (1991), Balkans, Iraq
- **Decommissioned:** 3 August 2005
- **Fate:** Sold for scrap 2011

### 2. HMS Illustrious (R06)
- **Built:** Swan Hunter, 1976-1982
- **Commissioned:** 20 June 1982
- **Service:** Falklands relief (1982), Gulf War (1991), Balkans, Sierra Leone, Libya (2011)
- **Decommissioned:** 28 August 2014
- **Fate:** Awaiting disposal (preserved as potential museum ship considered)

### 3. HMS Ark Royal (R07)
- **Built:** Swan Hunter, 1978-1985
- **Commissioned:** 1 November 1985
- **Service:** Gulf War (1991), Balkans, Iraq War (2003), Libya (2011)
- **Decommissioned:** 11 March 2011 (budget cuts)
- **Fate:** Sold for scrap 2013

## Falklands War (1982)

**HMS Invincible - Flagship:**
- Sailed with Task Force (April 1982)
- Flagship of Admiral Woodward
- Operated 8 Sea Harriers + Sea Kings
- **Sea Harriers shot down 20+ Argentine aircraft**
- No losses to enemy action
- Proved carrier aviation essential

**Harrier Performance:**
- Air superiority despite numerical inferiority
- 20+ confirmed kills, zero air-to-air losses
- Ground attack missions
- Proved V/STOL concept in combat

**Significance:**
- Invincible-class vindicated
- Carriers proved essential for power projection
- Without carriers, Falklands could not be retaken
- Led to retention of carrier force

## Post-Falklands Service

**Gulf War (1991):**
- All three ships deployed at various times
- Harriers conducted ground attack missions
- Demonstrated global reach

**Balkans (1990s):**
- Bosnia operations
- Kosovo operations
- Humanitarian missions

**Iraq War (2003):**
- Ark Royal flagship
- Harrier ground attack missions

**Libya (2011):**
- Ark Royal and Illustrious
- Final combat operations for class
- Harrier GR.9 strikes

## Decommissioning

**Budget Cuts & Replacement:**
- Ark Royal decommissioned 2011 (budget cuts)
- Harrier force retired 2010 (controversial)
- Invincible decommissioned 2005
- Illustrious decommissioned 2014

**No Carrier Gap:**
- 2011-2020: No fixed-wing carrier aviation
- HMS Ocean helicopter carrier filled gap
- Queen Elizabeth-class entered service 2020

## Legacy

**Ski-Jump Innovation:**
- Revolutionized V/STOL operations
- Adopted worldwide
- British naval engineering triumph

**Falklands War:**
- Proved carriers essential
- Sea Harrier combat success
- Saved British carrier aviation

**Service Record:**
- 34 years class service (1980-2014)
- All three ships saw combat
- Global operations
- Successful Cold War ASW platforms

**Replacement:**
- Queen Elizabeth-class (65,000 tons)
- 3× larger than Invincible-class
- F-35B instead of Harrier
- Return to fleet carrier capability

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Displacement | Aircraft | Type |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Invincible** | UK | 1980 | 20,600 tons | 18-22 | V/STOL ski-jump |
| Giuseppe Garibaldi | Italy | 1985 | 13,850 tons | 18 | V/STOL ski-jump |
| Príncipe de Asturias | Spain | 1988 | 17,188 tons | 29 | V/STOL ski-jump |
| Charles de Gaulle | France | 2001 | 42,000 tons | 40 | CATOBAR nuclear |

**Analysis:** Invincible-class pioneered affordable light carrier concept with ski-jump.
