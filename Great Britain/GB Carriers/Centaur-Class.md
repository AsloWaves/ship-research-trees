# Centaur-Class Light Fleet Carriers (1953-1959)

## Overview
Centaur-class were improved Light Fleet Carriers ordered 1943 as larger successors to Colossus-class. Four ships laid down 1944-1945 but completion delayed by post-war budget cuts - commissioned 1953-1959 (8-14 years after launch). Displacement grew from ~18,000 tons (designed) to 23,000 tons (as built). Aircraft capacity 30-40, speed 28-29 knots. All four ships had different careers: HMS Centaur (conventional carrier, scrapped 1972), HMS Albion (converted to commando carrier 1962, scrapped 1973), HMS Bulwark (converted to commando carrier 1960, scrapped 1984), HMS Hermes (conventional carrier, later VSTOL carrier with Sea Harriers, sold to India 1986 as INS Viraat, served until 2017 - longest-serving carrier ever). Represented last conventional British light carriers before jet age and VSTOL era.

- Intended for Pacific operations

**Order:**
- Four ships ordered 1943-1944
- Originally 8 planned
- Reduced to 4 due to costs
- Laid down 1944-1945

### Key Improvements Over Colossus

- HMS Hermes: 1971-1976 (brief)

**Operations:**
- Aden Emergency (1960s)
- Indonesian Confrontation (1963-1966)
- Persian Gulf patrol
- Numerous amphibious exercises
- Successful concept

## Legacy

**Improved Light Fleet Carriers:**
- Better than Colossus-class
- But still too small for modern jets
- Interim solution
- Not ideal but serviceable

**Long Construction Times:**
- 8-15 years from laying down to commission
- Too long - obsolescent when completed
- Post-war austerity delayed construction
- Unfortunate timing

**Diverse Careers:**
- Centaur: Conventional carrier, short service
- Albion: Conventional then commando carrier
- Bulwark: Conventional then commando carrier (longest commando service)
- Hermes: Conventional, commando, then VSTOL carrier - most adaptable

**HMS Hermes - Longest-Serving Carrier:**
- 58 years active service (British + Indian)
- Flagship at Falklands
- Demonstrated V/STOL concept
- Proved carrier adaptability
- Extraordinary longevity
- Outlived all contemporaries by decades

**Commando Carrier Concept:**
- Pioneered by Bulwark
- Successful specialized role
- Influenced later designs
- Led to Ocean-class LPH

**Last Conventional British Light Carriers:**
- After Centaur-class, no more light fleet carriers
- Shift to Audacious-class fleet carriers
- Then CVA-01 (cancelled)
- Then Invincible-class VSTOL carriers
- End of conventional light carrier era

## Comparison to Contemporary Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Type | Displacement | Aircraft | Speed | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|------|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| **Centaur-Class** | UK | 1953-1959 | Light fleet | 22,000 tons | 30-40 | 28 kn | Scrapped 1972-1984 (Hermes to India 1986) |
| Colossus-Class | UK | 1944 | Light fleet | 13,190 tons | 37 | 25 kn | Many exported, last retired 2001 |
| Essex-Class | USA | 1942 | Fleet carrier | 27,100 tons | 90-100 | 33 kn | Many modernized, served to 1991 |
| Audacious-Class | UK | 1951 | Fleet carrier | 36,800 tons | 60 | 31.5 kn | Scrapped 1979-1980 |
| Clemenceau-Class | France | 1961 | Fleet carrier | 27,307 tons | 40 | 32 kn | Scrapped 2008-2009 |

**Analysis:** Centaur-class intermediate size - larger than Colossus, smaller than Audacious. HMS Hermes' adaptability (VSTOL conversion) extended service life far beyond sisters.
