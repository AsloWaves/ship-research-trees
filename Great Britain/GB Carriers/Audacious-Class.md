# Audacious-Class Fleet Carriers (1951-1955)

## Overview
Audacious-class were Britain's largest and most capable post-war conventional aircraft carriers. Originally four ships planned (redesigned from Malta-class), only two completed: HMS Eagle (R05, commissioned 1951) and HMS Ark Royal (R09, commissioned 1955). Displacement grew from 36,800 tons (designed) to 43,000+ tons (modernized). Designed for jet aircraft with steam catapults, angled decks, and mirror landing systems. Aircraft capacity 60-80. Both ships extensively modernized 1959-1970 with new catapults, radar, and strengthened decks for Phantom jets. HMS Eagle served 1951-1972 (scrapped 1978). HMS Ark Royal served 1955-1978 (scrapped 1980) - Britain's last conventional aircraft carrier. Both operated Phantoms, Buccaneers, Gannets, Sea Vixens, and helicopters. Represented peak of British conventional carrier design before shift to VSTOL Invincible-class.

## Design - From Malta to Audacious

### Origin as Malta-Class (1942-1943)

**Original Malta-Class Plan:**
- 1942: Four large fleet carriers ordered
- **Malta-class:** 46,900 tons, 81 aircraft
- Armored hangar design (like Illustrious)
- Names: Malta, Gibraltar, New Zealand, Africa

**Malta-Class Specifications (Original):**
- 46,900 tons
- 81 aircraft
- Armored flight deck and hangar
- 4 × 4.5-inch guns (minimal armament)
- Very large for time

**Work Begins:**
- HMS Eagle (ex-Audacious): Laid down 24 October 1942 as Malta-class
- HMS Ark Royal (ex-Irresistible): Laid down 3 May 1943 as Malta-class
- Malta and Gibraltar never laid down

### Redesign as Audacious-Class (1943-1945)

**Problems with Malta Design:**
- Too heavy (armored design)
- Too slow to build
- War experience showed lighter carriers viable
- American carriers (unarmored) proved effective

**Redesign Decision (1943):**
- Redesign as lighter, faster-building carriers
- **Audacious-class designation**
- Reduced armor
- Increased aircraft capacity
- Better suited to jets

**Audacious Changes from Malta:**
- Lighter armor (still protected but not fully armored)
- Larger hangar (vs armored box hangar)
- More aircraft (60-80 vs 81)
- Faster construction
- Better suited to future jet aircraft

**Post-War Completion:**
- Both ships suspended 1945 (VJ-Day)
- Redesigned 1945-1946 for jet operations
- Angled deck concept added
- Steam catapults planned
- Major changes before completion

### HMS Ark Royal "Phantomization" (1967-1970)

**Most Extensive British Carrier Refit:**
- **Duration:** 3 years

- Needed stronger flight deck
- Massive engineering challenge

**Result:**
- Only British carrier that could operate Phantoms

- Ark Royal sole Phantom carrier
- Extended life to 1978

## Comparison - Eagle vs Ark Royal

| Feature | HMS Eagle | HMS Ark Royal |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Laid Down** | 24 Oct 1942 | 3 May 1943 |
| **Commissioned** | 5 Oct 1951 | 25 Feb 1955 |
| **As-Built Deck** | Straight | 5.5° angled |
| **Major Refit** | 1959-1964 | 1967-1970 ("Phantomization") |
| **Post-Refit Capability** | Buccaneer, Sea Vixen | Phantom, Buccaneer |
| **Decommissioned** | 1972 | 1978 |
| **Service Life** | 21 years | 23 years |
| **Fate** | Scrapped 1978 | Scrapped 1980 (last conventional carrier) |

**Why Eagle Retired First:**
- Treasury cuts (could only afford one carrier)
- Ark Royal had superior refit (Phantom-capable)
- Eagle would need expensive refit to match Ark Royal
- Cheaper to keep Ark Royal, retire Eagle
- Eagle cannibalized for Ark Royal spare parts

## End of British Conventional Carriers

**CVA-01 Cancelled (1966):**
- New 54,000-ton carrier planned
- Phantom and Buccaneer capable
- Ordered but cancelled by Labour government 1966
- "RAF can provide air cover" (proven wrong in Falklands)
- Political disaster

**Shift to VSTOL:**
- Invincible-class "through-deck cruisers" ordered 1973
- Sea Harrier V/STOL fighters
- Much smaller, cheaper
- Three ships vs one or two large carriers
- Different philosophy

**Ark Royal Retires (1978):**
- Last conventional carrier
- Emotional farewell
- End of 68 years of conventional carrier operations (since Argus 1918)
- Gap until Invincible commissioned 1980

**Vindication in Falklands (1982):**
- HMS Invincible and HMS Hermes (VSTOL carriers)
- Sea Harriers dominated
- Proved carriers essential
- CVA-01 cancellation recognized as mistake
- But VSTOL worked

## Legacy

**Peak of British Carrier Design:**
- Largest British carriers until Queen Elizabeth-class (2017)
- Most capable conventional carriers
- Operated advanced jets (Phantom, Buccaneer)
- Represented zenith of British carrier power

**Last Conventional Carriers:**
- Ark Royal last to serve (1978)
- No conventional British carriers since
- Shift to VSTOL permanent
- Queen Elizabeth-class STOVL (not conventional cats/traps)

**Jet Carrier Pioneers:**
- First British carriers designed for jets
- Angled deck pioneers
- Steam catapult pioneers
- Mirror landing system pioneers
- Influenced worldwide carrier design

**Phantom Operations:**
- Only British carriers to operate Phantoms
- Demonstrated British carrier capability
- Matched American carriers (smaller scale)
- Proved British jet carrier viability

**Political Lessons:**
- CVA-01 cancellation short-sighted
- "East of Suez" withdrawal mistake (partially)
- Falklands vindicated carriers
- But VSTOL cheaper and adequate

**Ark Royal - Symbol:**
- Last conventional carrier became symbol
- Farewell in 1978 marked end of era
- Name honored (Invincible-class Ark Royal 1985-2011)
- Represents peak and end of British carrier power

**Influenced Queen Elizabeth-Class:**
- Modern carriers learned from Audacious
- But STOVL not CATOBAR
- F-35B not catapult-launched aircraft
- Different philosophy

## Comparison to Contemporary Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Type | Displacement | Aircraft | Speed | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|------|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| **Audacious-Class** | UK | 1951-1955 | Fleet carrier | 43,000 tons | 60-80 | 31.5 kn | Scrapped 1978-1980 |
| Essex-Class SCB-27C | USA | 1951-1956 | Modernized fleet | 33,000 tons | 80-90 | 33 kn | Many served to 1990s |
| Forrestal-Class | USA | 1955 | Supercarrier | 60,000 tons | 80-90 | 33 kn | Served to 1993-1998 |
| Clemenceau-Class | France | 1961 | Fleet carrier | 27,300 tons | 40 | 32 kn | Scrapped 2008-2009 |
| Midway-Class (SCB-110) | USA | 1955 | Modernized fleet | 62,000 tons | 65-80 | 33 kn | Served to 1992 |

**Analysis:** Audacious-class comparable to modernized Essex-class, smaller than American supercarriers but capable. Phantom operations demonstrated competence. Shorter service life than American contemporaries due to budget cuts and VSTOL shift.
