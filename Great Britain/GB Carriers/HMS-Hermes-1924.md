# HMS Hermes - Aircraft Carrier (1924)

## Overview
HMS Hermes was the world's first purpose-built aircraft carrier, designed from the keel up as a carrier rather than converted from another ship type. Laid down 15 January 1918, launched 11 September 1919, commissioned 18 February 1924. She pioneered the island superstructure design (offset to starboard) that became standard for all future carriers. Small by later standards (10,850 tons, 20-24 aircraft), she served interwar period in Atlantic, Mediterranean, and China Station. Sunk 9 April 1942 off Ceylon by 85 Japanese dive bombers with no air cover aboard - caught defenseless. 307 killed including Captain Onslow, 590 survived. Historic ship lost to overwhelming air attack.

## World's First Purpose-Built Aircraft Carrier

**Revolutionary Concept:**
- **First carrier designed as carrier from the keel**
- Not a conversion like Argus or Furious
- Purpose-built for aircraft operations
- Set template for all future carriers
- Historic achievement

**Construction Timeline:**
- **Laid down:** 15 January 1918 (during WWI)
- **Launched:** 11 September 1919 (post-war)
- **Towed to Devonport** for completion January 1920
- **Commissioned:** 18 February 1924
- 6-year construction (war delays, budget cuts)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Dedicated aircraft carrier from conception
- Optimized for carrier operations
- No compromises from conversion
- Purpose-designed hangar, flight deck, lifts
- Created carrier design paradigm

## Island Superstructure - Revolutionary Feature

**Offset Island Design:**
- **Island superstructure to starboard** - first time on any carrier
- Bridge, funnel, command facilities on island
- Flight deck unobstructed to port
- Captain's view of deck operations
- Set standard for all future carriers

**Why Island Was Revolutionary:**
- HMS Argus: No island (bridge below deck) - impractical
- HMS Furious: Split decks with central superstructure - dangerous
- **Hermes: Offset island** - best of both worlds
- Clear view for command
- Unobstructed flight operations
- All subsequent carriers copied design

**Design Modified (March 1920):**
- Original design had no island
- Modified after HMS Furious problems
- Island added before completion
- Funnel integrated into island
- Proved ideal solution

## Design Features

**Flight Deck:**
- 570 feet long × 70 feet wide
- Full-length continuous deck
- Longitudinal arrestor wires
- Take-off and landing capability
- Wooden deck on steel structure

**Hangar:**
- 400 feet long
- Single hangar deck
- Small by later standards
- Limited to **20 aircraft** initially
- Later modified for 24 aircraft
- Maintenance and repair facilities

**Aircraft Lifts:**
- Two lifts (forward and aft)
- Hydraulically operated
- Connected hangar to flight deck
- Standard two-lift configuration

**Protection:**
- **3-inch waterline belt armor**
- **1-inch flight deck armor**
- Minimal protection (small, light carrier)
- Vulnerable to bombs and torpedoes
- Later proved fatal

**Armament:**
- 6× 5.5-inch guns (surface defense)
- 3× 4-inch AA guns (limited AA protection)
- Inadequate by WWII standards
- No heavy AA weapons

## Limitations of First Purpose-Built Design

**Too Small:**
- Only 10,850 tons (standard)
- Limited to 20-24 aircraft
- Contemporary battleships: 30,000+ tons
- Small to save money
- Proved inadequate

**Slow Speed:**
- 25 knots (26.2 knots max)
- Slower than fleet carriers (30+ knots ideal)
- Couldn't keep up with battle fleet
- Limited operational flexibility

**Inexperience Showed:**
- First purpose-built = learning experience
- Hangar too small
- Flight deck relatively narrow
- Limited elevator capacity
- Subsequent carriers much better

**Budget Constraints:**
- Post-WWI austerity
- Royal Navy budget cuts
- Could have been larger
- Economic limitations hurt design

## Interwar Service (1924-1939)

### Atlantic Fleet (1924-1925)

**Initial Assignment:**
- Brief service with Atlantic Fleet
- Working up and trials
- Proving carrier operations
- Developing doctrine

### Mediterranean Fleet (1925-1930s)

**Primary Assignment:**
- Based at Malta
- Most of interwar service
- Fleet exercises
- Carrier aviation development
- Training platform

**Aircraft Operated:**
- Fairey Flycatcher fighters
- Fairey IIIF reconnaissance
- Blackburn Dart torpedo bombers
- Various biplane types

### China Station (1930s)

**Far East Service:**
- Transferred to China Station
- Hong Kong based
- Show-the-flag operations
- Presence during Sino-Japanese tensions
- Police actions

**Limited Modernization:**
- Some AA guns added
- Minimal updates
- Budget constraints
- Obsolete by late 1930s

## WWII Service (1939-1942)

### Early War (1939-1940)

**Convoy Protection:**
- Initially assigned to convoy escort
- South Atlantic patrols
- Anti-raider operations
- Limited effectiveness (slow, small air group)

### Dakar Operation (September 1940)

**Failed Anglo-French Operation:**
- Attempted to secure Dakar, French West Africa
- Hermes provided air cover
- Operation failed (Vichy French resistance)
- Hermes withdrew

### East Indies (1941-1942)

**Transfer to Indian Ocean:**
- Assigned to East Indies Station
- Based in Ceylon (Sri Lanka)
- Limited aircraft aboard
- Vulnerable position

**Obsolete by 1942:**
- 18-year-old design
- Slow (25 knots)
- Small (20-24 aircraft)
- Inadequate AA defenses
- No match for modern carriers

## Sinking off Ceylon (9 April 1942)

### Indian Ocean Raid - Japanese Offensive

**Strategic Situation:**
- March-April 1942: Japanese offensive into Indian Ocean
- Admiral Nagumo's Kido Butai (Pearl Harbor veterans)
- 5 fleet carriers: Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, Zuikaku
- Hermes desperately outmatched

**April 8, 1942 - Warning Received:**
- Hermes berthed at Trincomalee, Ceylon
- Warning of Japanese raid received
- **Ordered to sail immediately**
- Left Trincomalee for Maldives
- **No aircraft aboard** - sent ashore earlier
- Defenseless

### The Attack - 9 April 1942

**0955 Hours - Spotted:**
- Japanese scout plane spotted Hermes near Batticaloa
- Reported position to strike force
- Hermes had no air cover
- No defending fighters

**1035 Hours - Attack Begins:**
- **85× Aichi D3A "Val" dive bombers** (from 5 carriers)
- **9× A6M "Zero" fighters** (escort)
- Overwhelming force
- **At least 32 dive bombers attacked Hermes**

**Catastrophic Damage:**
- **Hit by 40 bombs** in minutes
- Completely overwhelmed
- Fires throughout ship
- Listing heavily
- Rapid flooding

**1050 Hours - Sinking:**
- Hermes capsized and sank
- **Only 15 minutes from first hit to sinking**
- Ship gone in minutes
- One of fastest carrier sinkings

**Casualties:**
- **307 killed** including Captain Richard F. J. Onslow
- **590 survivors** rescued by hospital ship Vita
- 45% of crew killed
- Captain went down with ship

**Escorting Ships Also Sunk:**
- HMAS Vampire (destroyer) sunk
- HMS Hollyhock (corvette) sunk
- RFA Athelstane (tanker) sunk
- Entire force destroyed

### Why Hermes Was Doomed

**No Air Cover:**
- Aircraft sent ashore (not aboard)
- No fighters to defend
- Helpless against dive bombers
- Fatal mistake

**Obsolete Design:**
- Slow (25 knots - couldn't outrun attackers)
- Weak AA defenses
- Small, vulnerable
- 18-year-old ship vs modern Japanese force

**Overwhelming Japanese Force:**
- 85 dive bombers vs 1 small carrier
- Pearl Harbor veteran pilots
- No chance of survival
- Caught in open water

**Strategic Failure:**
- Sent away from port without air cover
- Should have stayed in port or had fighters
- Sacrificed unnecessarily
- Poor command decisions

## Wreck

**Location:**
- Off Batticaloa, eastern Ceylon (Sri Lanka)
- Depth: ~175 feet
- Upright on seabed

**War Grave:**
- 307 men entombed
- Protected site
- Designated war grave
- Diving permitted but respectful

**Historical Significance:**
- First purpose-built carrier lost in combat
- Symbol of early war disasters
- Reminder of Japanese dominance 1941-1942

## Legacy

**Pioneer of Carrier Design:**
- **First purpose-built aircraft carrier**
- Set template for all future carriers
- Island superstructure standard
- Historic achievement
- Revolutionary contribution

**Island Superstructure:**
- Offset to starboard became universal standard
- Every carrier since has used island
- Solved navigation/command problems
- Hermes' most important legacy

**Design Lessons:**
- Purpose-built better than conversions
- But size matters - Hermes too small
- Carrier needs speed (25 knots inadequate)
- AA defenses critical
- Subsequent carriers much larger

**Tragic Loss:**
- Caught defenseless without aircraft
- Overwhelmed by Japanese force
- Symbol of early war defeats
- 307 men lost
- Could have been avoided

**Historic Significance:**
- Changed naval warfare
- Proved carrier concept
- First but not last carrier battle
- Path from Hermes to supercarriers
