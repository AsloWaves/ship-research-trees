# Implacable-Class Aircraft Carriers (1944)

## Overview
Implacable-class were improved Illustrious-class armored carriers with larger hangars and greater aircraft capacity. Two ships built: HMS Implacable and HMS Indefatigable, both commissioned 1944 - too late for most of WWII. Retained armored hangar concept but with single enlarged hangar (vs Illustrious' cramped double hangar) carrying 48-54 aircraft (vs Illustrious' 36). Displacement ~26,000 tons, speed 32 knots, armament 16× 4.5-inch DP guns. Both ships served in Pacific 1945, participated in final strikes on Japan. Post-war served as training carriers through early 1950s. HMS Implacable scrapped 1955, HMS Indefatigable scrapped 1956. Represented peak of British armored carrier design before shift to lighter, larger post-war designs.

- Back in action within hours
- Demonstrated armored deck value

**Final Strikes on Japan (July-August 1945):**
- Participated in final carrier strikes
- Hit Tokyo area
- Destroyed aircraft on ground
- Present at Japanese surrender

### HMS Implacable (Commissioned Later)

**Late Commission:**
- Commissioned August 1944
- Too late for most European operations
- Work-up and training

**Pacific Transfer (May 1945):**
- Sailed to Pacific June 1945
- Arrived July 1945 (very late)
- Task Force 57
- Limited operations

**Final Strikes (July-August 1945):**
- Participated in final strikes on Japan
- Very limited action before surrender
- Mostly training and preparation
- War ended soon after arrival

**VJ-Day:**
- Present in Pacific at Japanese surrender
- Part of British Pacific Fleet
- Victory achieved

### Limited Combat Contribution

**Too Late:**
- Both ships commissioned 1944
- Most of WWII over by then
- Limited combat time
- Mostly post-war service

**But Proved Armored Deck:**
- Indefatigable took kamikaze hit
- Minor damage only
- Back in action quickly
- Validated armored design

## Post-War Service (1945-1954)

### Immediate Post-War (1945-1947)

**Pacific Occupation:**
- Both ships remained in Pacific 1945-1946
- Occupation duties
- Repatriation of POWs
- Show-the-flag operations

**Return to UK:**
- Returned to Britain 1946-1947
- Peacetime role uncertain
- Budget cuts looming

### Training Carriers (1947-1954)

**HMS Indefatigable:**
- Became training carrier 1947
- Based in UK waters
- Deck-landing training
- Pilot qualification
- Reserve status 1950
- Paid off June 1954

**HMS Implacable:**
- Training carrier 1947-1950
- Limited operations
- Mediterranean deployment 1949
- Reserve status 1950
- Paid off March 1954

**Limited Use:**
- Too expensive to operate in peacetime
- Newer carriers available (Light Fleet Carriers)
- Jets needed bigger carriers
- Limited role for armored carriers

### Modernization Not Pursued

**Why Not Modernized:**
- Post-war budget cuts
- Newer carriers available
- Jet aircraft needed larger decks
- Modernization too expensive
- Better to build new

**Fate Sealed:**
- Both ships obsolete by 1950
- Too small for jet operations
- Armored hangar limited growth
- Better to scrap and build new

## Scrapping

**HMS Implacable:**
- Paid off March 1954
- Sold for scrap 1955
- Broken up at Inverkeithing
- Only 11 years service
- Shortest-lived British fleet carrier

**HMS Indefatigable:**
- Paid off June 1954
- Sold for scrap 1956
- Broken up at Dalmuir
- Only 12 years service
- Limited career

**Tragic Waste:**
- Huge investment
- Very limited use
- Commissioned too late
- Obsolete too soon
- But no choice - jet age arrived

## Comparison to Illustrious-Class

| Feature | Illustrious-Class | Implacable-Class |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Ships** | 4 (6 including variants) | 2 |
| **Commissioned** | 1940-1941 | 1944 |
| **Displacement** | 23,000 tons | 23,000 tons (standard) |
| **Aircraft** | 36 operational | 48-54 operational |
| **Hangar** | 2 small (16 ft high) | 1 large (17.5 ft high) |
| **Hangar Length** | 456 ft (upper), 208 ft (lower) | 458 ft (single) |
| **Speed** | 30.5 knots | 32 knots (faster) |
| **Range** | 10,700 nmi | 11,000 nmi |
| **Armament** | 16× 4.5" DP | 16× 4.5" DP (improved) |
| **WWII Service** | Extensive (1940-1945) | Limited (1944-1945) |
| **Fate** | Most scrapped 1950s-1960s | Both scrapped 1955-1956 |

**Analysis:** Implacable improved on Illustrious design - more aircraft, better layout, faster. But commissioned too late for significant WWII contribution.

## Armored Deck Advantages - Pacific Kamikaze Defense

**British vs American Carriers:**
- **British:** Armored flight decks (2-3 inches)
- **American:** Unarmored wooden decks

**Kamikaze Resistance:**
- American carriers severely damaged by kamikazes
- HMS Indefatigable hit by kamikaze - minor damage
- Armored deck prevented penetration
- Ship back in action within hours
- American carrier might be out for months

**Examples:**
- **USS Franklin (CV-13):** Bombed March 1945, 724 killed, nearly sunk
- **USS Bunker Hill (CV-17):** Kamikaze hits, 389 killed, out of action
- **HMS Indefatigable:** Kamikaze hit, ~14 casualties, back in hours

**Trade-Off:**
- British: Better protection, fewer aircraft (48 vs 90+)
- American: More aircraft, vulnerable to damage
- Different philosophies
- Both worked

## Legacy

**Improved Illustrious:**
- Validated improvements
- Larger hangar worked
- More aircraft valuable
- Better balanced design

**Armored Deck Proven:**
- Kamikaze hit demonstrated value
- Armored deck saved ship
- Could have saved American carriers
- But limited aircraft capacity

**Too Late:**
- Commissioned too late for WWII impact
- Limited combat service
- Huge investment, limited return
- Timing unfortunate

**Short Service Life:**
- 11-12 years only
- Jet age made them obsolete
- Too small for jets
- Armored hangar limited modernization
- Could not adapt

**Last Armored Carriers:**
- Peak of British armored carrier design
- Last of the line
- Post-war carriers unarmored (larger decks)
- End of concept

**Historical Significance:**
- Demonstrated limits of armored design
- Showed trade-offs
- Influenced post-war thinking
- Led to larger, unarmored designs

## Aircraft Operated

**WWII (1944-1945):**
- **Supermarine Seafire** (fighter) - main fighter
- **Fairey Barracuda** (torpedo/dive bomber)
- **Grumman Avenger** (torpedo bomber) - Lend-Lease
- **Fairey Firefly** (fighter-reconnaissance)
- **Chance Vought Corsair** (fighter) - Lend-Lease

**Post-War (1945-1954):**
- **Supermarine Seafire FR.47** (late mark)
- **Hawker Sea Fury** (fighter)
- **Fairey Firefly** (various marks)
- **Blackburn Firebrand** (torpedo fighter)
- Various training aircraft

## Comparison to Contemporary Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Type | Displacement | Aircraft | Speed | Fate |
|---------|--------|------|------|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| **Implacable-Class** | UK | 1944 | Armored fleet | 23,000 tons | 48-54 | 32 kn | Scrapped 1955-1956 |
| Illustrious-Class | UK | 1940 | Armored fleet | 23,000 tons | 36 | 30.5 kn | Most scrapped 1950s-1960s |
| Essex-Class | USA | 1942 | Fleet carrier | 27,100 tons | 90-100 | 33 kn | Many modernized, lasted to 1970s-1990s |
| Midway-Class | USA | 1945 | Fleet carrier | 45,000 tons | 130+ | 33 kn | Served to 1992 |
| Colossus-Class | UK | 1944 | Light fleet | 13,190 tons | 37 | 25 kn | Many sold abroad, lasted to 1990s |

**Analysis:** Implacable good design but caught between eras. Too late for WWII, too small for jets. Essex-class better suited to modernization (larger, unarmored decks).
