# Colossus-Class Light Fleet Carriers (1944)

## Overview
The Colossus-class were fast-built light fleet carriers designed for rapid wartime construction using commercial shipbuilding standards. Sixteen ordered 1942-1943, but only eight completed as Colossus-class by war's end with just four seeing WWII service (none in combat). They revolutionized carrier design with simple, economical construction that could be built by yards without carrier experience. Most were sold or loaned to seven foreign navies (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, Netherlands), providing affordable carrier capability worldwide. HMS Glory and Ocean served in Korean War.

## Revolutionary Design Philosophy

**Rapid Construction for Wartime:**
- Designed for commercial shipyards (no carrier experience required)
- Simple construction using merchant ship standards
- Prefabricated sections for rapid assembly
- 2-3 year build time (vs 4-5 for fleet carriers)
- No armor to speed construction

**"Light Fleet" Concept:**
- Smaller, simpler than fleet carriers (Illustrious-class)
- 18,300 tons vs 28,000+ tons for fleet carriers
- Fast enough for fleet operations (25 knots)
- Economical to operate
- Could be built in numbers

**Commercial Standards:**
- Merchant ship construction methods
- Simple machinery
- Unarmored (no protective schemes)
- Allowed yards without military experience to build

## Comparison to Fleet Carriers

| Class | Year | Displacement | Speed | Aircraft | Armor | Fate |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|----------|-------|------|
| **Colossus** | 1944 | 18,300 tons | 25 kn | 37 | None | 8 built, sold to 7 nations |
| Illustrious | 1940 | 28,600 tons | 30.5 kn | 36-54 | 3" armored deck | 6 built, all scrapped |
| Implacable | 1944 | 32,110 tons | 32 kn | 81 | 3" armored deck | 2 built, scrapped 1950s |

**Analysis:** Colossus traded armor and size for rapid, economical construction and ease of operation.
