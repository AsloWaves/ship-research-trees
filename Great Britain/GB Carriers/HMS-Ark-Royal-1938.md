# HMS Ark Royal (1938-1941)

## Overview
HMS Ark Royal was one of the most famous British warships of WWII, serving from 1938 until her sinking by U-81 in November 1941. The first purpose-built modern aircraft carrier for the Royal Navy, she participated in numerous operations including the hunt for Bismarck, where her Swordfish aircraft crippled the German battleship. Torpedoed near Gibraltar, Ark Royal capsized and sank despite salvage efforts, becoming a symbol of British naval determination.

## Service History (1938-1941)

### 1939: Early WWII

**Channel Operations:**
- Hunted German U-boats
- Covered shipping
- First carrier operations of WWII

**Norway Campaign (April-June 1940):**
- Provided air cover for Allied forces
- Lost several aircraft
- Evacuated after Allied defeat

### 1940: Force H Gibraltar

**Joined Force H (Mediterranean):**
- Based at Gibraltar
- Key unit of Mediterranean Fleet
- Escorted Malta convoys

**Mers-el-Kébir (July 1940):**
- Participated in attack on French Fleet
- Aircraft spotted for battleships
- Prevented French ships reaching Germany

**Mediterranean Operations:**
- Malta convoy escorts
- Attacked Italian bases
- Dueled with Italian Air Force

### 1941: Hunt for Bismarck (May 1941)

**Most Famous Action:**

**24 May 1941:** Hood sunk by Bismarck

**26 May 1941:** Ark Royal's Swordfish attack Bismarck
- Launched 15 Swordfish torpedo bombers in rough seas
- First attack hit HMS Sheffield by mistake (no casualties)
- Second attack: **One torpedo hit Bismarck's rudder**
- **Critical damage:** Bismarck unable to steer, circled helplessly
- Made possible Bismarck's sinking next day (27 May)

**Result:** Ark Royal's aircraft crippled Bismarck, enabling revenge for Hood

### 1941: Mediterranean Return

**Malta Convoys:**
- Resumed convoy escort duties
- Delivered Hurricane fighters to Malta
- Vital to Malta's survival

**Final Weeks:**
- Based Gibraltar
- Numerous Malta convoy operations
- Aircraft ferry missions

## Sinking (13-14 November 1941)

### The Attack

**13 November 1941, 30 miles east of Gibraltar:**

**15:40:** Torpedoed by **U-81** (Oberleutnant Friedrich Guggenberger)
- Single torpedo hit starboard side near stern
- 130-foot hole in hull
- One crewman killed initially

**Damage:**
- Immediate 10° list
- Severe flooding
- Loss of all electrical power
- Boiler uptakes flooded
- Dead in the water after 1 hour 19 minutes

**Salvage Attempts:**
- Destroyer HMS Legion came alongside
- Attempted to take carrier in tow
- Pumps brought aboard
- Flooding could not be controlled

**06:13, 14 November 1941:**
- Capsized and sank
- Only 1 death total (in initial torpedo hit)
- 1,487 crew rescued

**Wreck:**
- Depth: 3,500 feet (1,070 m)
- Location: East of Gibraltar
- Located 2002 by underwater survey

## Why She Sank

**Causes:**
1. **Power loss:** Electrical systems flooded, pumps failed
2. **Design flaw:** Boiler uptakes positioned low, vulnerable to flooding
3. **Single torpedo:** One hit proved fatal due to unlucky location
4. **Slow flooding:** Took 14 hours but inevitable

**Controversy:**
- Some blamed poor damage control
- Others cited design vulnerabilities
- Modern analysis: Unlucky hit in critical location

**Lessons:**
- Importance of auxiliary power systems
- Damage control training critical
- Design redundancy essential

## Legacy

**Combat Record:**
- Sank/damaged numerous enemy ships
- Delivered aircraft to Malta (critical)
- **Crippled Bismarck** - most famous action
- Symbol of British naval aviation

**Famous Ship:**
- One of most famous British warships
- Featured in propaganda
- Name synonymous with British carrier power
- Loss shocked Britain

**Namesakes:**
- HMS Ark Royal (R09, 1955-1979) - fleet carrier
- HMS Ark Royal (R07, 1985-2011) - Invincible-class carrier
- Name continues British carrier tradition
