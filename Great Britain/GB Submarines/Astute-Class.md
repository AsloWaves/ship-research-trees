# Astute-Class Nuclear Attack Submarines (2010)

## Overview
The Astute-class are the Royal Navy's current nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSN), representing the largest, most advanced, and most capable attack submarines ever operated by the UK. Seven boats planned with five commissioned and two under construction (2025). They feature PWR2 nuclear reactors (no refueling for 25-year life), advanced sonar (Sonar 2076), 38 weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles and Spearfish torpedoes, and are reportedly the quietest submarines ever built.

## Comparison to Predecessors

| Class | Year | Displacement | Reactor | Weapons | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Astute** | 2010 | 7,400 tons | PWR2 | 38 (Tomahawk/Spearfish) | Active (5 boats) |
| Trafalgar | 1983 | 5,200 tons | PWR1 | 30 (Tomahawk/Tigerfish) | Retired 2024 |
