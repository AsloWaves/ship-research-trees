# Vanguard-Class Ballistic Missile Submarines (1993)

## Overview
The Vanguard-class are the Royal Navy's nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) and the sole platform for the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent since 1998. Four boats maintain the Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (CASD) - Operation Relentless - ensuring at least one submarine is always on patrol, armed with 16 Trident II D5 missiles. Commissioned 1993-1999, they are based at HMNB Clyde (Faslane) and will be replaced by Dreadnought-class submarines in the 2030s.
