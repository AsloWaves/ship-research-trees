# Lion-Class Battlecruisers (1912)

## Overview
The Lion-class were the first British "super-dreadnought" battlecruisers, featuring eight 13.5-inch guns and 27-knot speed, making them the most powerful and largest warships in the world when completed (1912-1913). Three ships built: HMS Lion (flagship), HMS Princess Royal, and HMS Queen Mary. They fought in all major WWI North Sea actions with HMS Lion and Princess Royal heavily damaged at Dogger Bank and Jutland. HMS Queen Mary catastrophically exploded at Jutland (31 May 1916) with 1,266 killed. Survivors scrapped 1924 under Washington Naval Treaty.

- 27-knot speed maintained
- Largest warships in world when completed
- Cost: ~£2 million per ship

**Armament:**

## WWI Service & Major Battles

### Battle of Heligoland Bight (28 August 1914)

**First Major Naval Action of WWI:**
- Lion (flagship Beatty), Princess Royal, Queen Mary deployed
- Distant support to light cruisers and destroyers
- British victory
- Lion fired first shots
- Demonstrated speed and firepower

### Battle of Dogger Bank (24 January 1915)

**HMS Lion Severely Damaged:**
- Lion (flagship Beatty), Princess Royal, Queen Mary pursued German battlecruisers
- **Lion hit by 17 shells**
- Hit on "Q" turret nearly caused magazine explosion
- Lion fell out of line, flooding and fires
- Signal confusion allowed German escape
- Lion towed back to port

**Battle Results:**
- German SMS Blücher sunk
- Lion nearly lost (700 tons water, speed reduced to 10 knots)
- Exposed magazine vulnerability
- Repairs took 4 months

### Battle of Jutland (31 May 1916)

**"The Run to the South" - Queen Mary Destroyed:**

**HMS Queen Mary (3:26 PM):**
- Engaged SMS Derfflinger and Seydlitz
- Fired ~150 rounds at German battlecruisers
- Hit twice by SMS Derfflinger
- **3:26 PM: Catastrophic magazine explosion**
- Ship broke in half
- Entire forward section vaporized
- **1,266 men killed, only 20 survived**
- "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today" - Beatty

**HMS Lion Nearly Destroyed:**
- Flagship of Admiral Beatty
- Hit by **13× 12-inch shells + 1× 5.9-inch shell**
- Hit on "Q" turret penetrated roof
- Flash fire down to magazine
- **Major Francis Harvey VC ordered magazine flooded**
- Harvey mortally wounded but saved ship
- **99 killed, 51 wounded**
- Victoria Cross awarded posthumously to Harvey

**HMS Princess Royal Damaged:**
- Hit by **9 shells** (8× 12-inch, 1× 11-inch)
- "Q" turret out of action
- Fires in secondary armament
- **22 killed, 81 wounded**
- Remained in action

**Beatty's Famous Quote:**
- After Queen Mary exploded: "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today"
- Indefatigable had exploded 10 minutes earlier
- Two battlecruisers destroyed in 10 minutes
- Magazine vulnerability exposed

### Post-Jutland Service

**Reforms After Jutland:**
- Magazine handling procedures improved
- Additional anti-flash protection
- Cordite storage modified
- More cautious deployment

**Grand Fleet Operations (1916-1918):**
- Lion and Princess Royal continued service
- Fleet sweeps of North Sea
- No major actions after Jutland
- German High Seas Fleet avoided battle

## Major Francis Harvey VC - Hero of Jutland

**Royal Marines Major:**
- Commander of "Q" turret on HMS Lion
- Shell penetrated turret roof at Jutland
- Flash fire killed all turret crew
- Harvey mortally wounded (both legs shattered)
- **Ordered magazine flooded before dying**
- Saved Lion from explosion like Queen Mary
- **Victoria Cross awarded posthumously**
- Sacrifice saved 1,000+ shipmates

## Decommissioning & Washington Naval Treaty

**Post-War (1918-1922):**
- Lion and Princess Royal survived war
- Placed in reserve
- Expensive to operate
- Outdated compared to Hood

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Limited battleship/battlecruiser numbers
- UK had to scrap older capital ships
- Lion paid off 1922, scrapped 1924
- Princess Royal sold for scrap 31 January 1924
- Allowed UK to build new ships under treaty

## Design Flaws & Lessons

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. **Inadequate Deck Armor:** Only 1-2.5 inches vs plunging fire
2. **Magazine Protection:** Insufficient anti-flash precautions
3. **Cordite Handling:** Exposed cordite in handling rooms
4. **Turret Design:** Roof armor too thin (9 inches)

**Lessons from Jutland:**
- Speed and firepower not enough
- Protection equally important
- Magazine safety critical
- Informed Hood and later designs

**"Speed is Armor" Doctrine Failed:**
- Fisher's battlecruiser concept: speed to avoid hits
- Jutland proved shells would hit
- Inadequate armor fatal
- Later British battlecruisers better armored

## HMS Queen Mary - Tragic Loss

**Explosion Details:**
- 3:26 PM, 31 May 1916
- Hit by Derfflinger's 12-inch shells
- Magazines exploded (possibly both)
- Forward section vaporized instantly
- Ship broke in half
- Sank in seconds

**Casualties:**
- **1,266 killed**
- **Only 20 survivors**
- 98.4% fatality rate
- Worst British warship loss at Jutland
- Bodies never recovered

**Survivors:**
- Pulled from water by destroyers
- Mostly from upper deck or turrets
- Traumatized by explosion

**Wreck:**
- Lies in 180 feet of water, North Sea
- Located by survey ships
- Designated war grave
- Protected site

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Class | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Armor (belt) | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|--------------|------|
| **Lion** | UK | 1912 | 26,350 tons | 27 kn | 8× 13.5" | 9-4" | 2 scrapped 1924, 1 sunk Jutland |
| Moltke | Germany | 1911 | 25,400 tons | 28 kn | 10× 11" | 10.5-3" | Survived Jutland, scuttled 1919 |
| Kongo | Japan | 1913 | 27,500 tons | 27.5 kn | 8× 14" | 8" | Modernized, sunk WWII |
| Seydlitz | Germany | 1913 | 28,550 tons | 26.5 kn | 10× 11" | 12-4" | Survived 21 hits Jutland |

**Analysis:** Lion-class had superior firepower but inadequate protection compared to German battlecruisers.
