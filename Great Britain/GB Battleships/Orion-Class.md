# Orion-Class Battleships (1912)

## Overview
The Orion-class were the world's first "super-dreadnoughts," introducing 13.5-inch guns (vs 12-inch on earlier dreadnoughts) and revolutionary all-centerline turret arrangement for maximum broadside firepower. Four ships commissioned 1912: HMS Orion, Monarch, Conqueror, and Thunderer. They served with 2nd Battle Squadron throughout WWI, participating in Battle of Jutland (1916) where all four engaged but took no damage. Obsolete by 1918, all scrapped 1922-1926 under Washington Naval Treaty, except HMS Monarch used as target ship.

## Revolutionary Design Features

**First "Super-Dreadnoughts":**
- Larger guns than any previous battleship
- **13.5-inch guns** vs 12-inch on HMS Dreadnought
- Shell weight: 1,400 lbs (vs 850 lbs for 12-inch)
- Greater range and penetration
- Set new standard for battleship power

**All-Centerline Turret Arrangement:**
- **Revolutionary layout:** All 5 turrets on centerline
- No wing turrets (unlike earlier dreadnoughts)
- "2-1-2" arrangement: 2 forward, 1 amidships (super-firing), 2 aft
- **10-gun broadside** (vs 8 on earlier dreadnoughts with wing turrets)
- Maximum firepower on either beam
- More efficient use of displacement

**"A"-"B"-"Q"-"X"-"Y" Turret Names:**
- First use of this naming convention
- "A" and "B" forward (B super-firing over A)
- "Q" amidships (super-firing over forward funnel)
- "X" and "Y" aft (Y super-firing over X)
- Became standard for British battleships

**Improved Protection:**
- 12-inch belt armor (vs 11 inches on Dreadnought)
- Better underwater protection
- Improved internal subdivision
- Heavier barbette and turret armor
- Still vulnerable to mines and torpedoes

## WWI Service

### 2nd Battle Squadron

**Grand Fleet Assignment:**
- All four Orion-class assigned to 2nd Battle Squadron
- Based at Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands
- Core of Grand Fleet battle line
- Ready to engage German High Seas Fleet

**North Sea Patrols:**
- Fleet sweeps looking for German ships
- Convoy escort duties
- Support for smaller vessels
- Deterrent presence

### Battle of Jutland (31 May 1916)

**All Four Ships Present:**
- Part of 2nd Battle Squadron (6 battleships total)
- Led by Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram
- Deployed in battle line

**Action During Battle:**
- Engaged German battleships and battlecruisers
- Fired numerous 13.5-inch shells
- HMS Orion reportedly hit SMS Kaiser
- HMS Monarch engaged SMS Derfflinger
- Long-range gunnery (15,000+ yards)

**No Damage Sustained:**
- **All four Orion-class survived undamaged**
- No casualties aboard Orion-class ships
- Protected by Grand Fleet deployment
- Germans did not concentrate fire on them

**Battle Performance:**
- 13.5-inch guns effective at long range
- Gunnery hampered by visibility
- Contributed to German withdrawal
- Demonstrated super-dreadnought power

### Post-Jutland Service (1916-1918)

**Continued Grand Fleet Service:**
- Fleet sweeps of North Sea
- No further major engagements
- German High Seas Fleet avoided battle after Jutland
- Deterrent presence

**November 1918:**
- Present at surrender of German High Seas Fleet
- Witnessed German ships entering Scapa Flow
- Participated in internment operations

## Post-War Fate

### Obsolescence (1918-1919)

**Reasons for Obsolescence:**
- Relatively slow (21 knots vs 23-25 knots for newer ships)
- Oil-fired battleships more efficient
- Queen Elizabeth-class (15-inch guns) superior
- Expensive to maintain
- Crew-intensive

**Reserve Fleet (1919):**
- All four reduced to reserve
- Skeleton crews
- Minimum maintenance
- Awaiting disposal

### Washington Naval Treaty (1922)

**Tonnage Limits:**
- UK required to scrap older capital ships
- Orion-class selected for disposal
- Could not compete with modern ships
- Too expensive to modernize

**HMS Orion - Scrapped 1922-1923:**
- Sold for scrap December 1922
- Broken up at Dalmarnock 1923
- Relatively quick disposal

**HMS Conqueror - Scrapped 1922-1923:**
- Sold for scrap December 1922
- Broken up 1923
- Same fate as Orion

**HMS Monarch - Target Ship:**
- Initially listed for sale
- Hulked instead for gunnery target
- **20 January 1925:** Full day of shelling and bombing
- Modern battleships and aircraft tested weapons
- **Sunk by gunfire from HMS Revenge**
- Demonstrated improvement in naval gunnery
- Wreck lies in shallow water off Portsmouth

**HMS Thunderer - Last to Go:**
- Served as training ship 1922-1926
- Accommodated naval cadets
- Static training duties
- Sold for scrap December 1926
- Last Orion-class scrapped

## Gunnery Incident - HMS Thunderer

**June 1912 Accident:**
- Shortly after commissioning
- During gunnery practice
- Malfunction caused turret to fire two shells simultaneously
- Both shells tumbled and fell short
- No casualties but damaged gun barrel
- Investigation improved safety procedures

## Comparison to Predecessors

| Class | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Belt Armor | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Orion** | 1912 | 22,200 tons | 21 kn | 10× 13.5" (5×2) | 12" | First super-dreadnought |
| Neptune | 1911 | 19,900 tons | 21 kn | 10× 12" | 10" | Last 12-inch battleship |
| Colossus | 1911 | 20,225 tons | 21 kn | 10× 12" | 11" | Dreadnought type |
| Dreadnought | 1906 | 18,110 tons | 21 kn | 10× 12" (5×2) | 11" | First all-big-gun |

**Analysis:** Orion represented major leap in firepower with 13.5-inch guns and all-centerline turrets.

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Class | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Orion** | UK | 1912 | 22,200 tons | 21 kn | 10× 13.5" (5×2) | All scrapped 1922-1926 |
| König | Germany | 1914 | 25,800 tons | 21 kn | 10× 12" (5×2) | Scuttled 1919 (Scapa Flow) |
| New York | USA | 1914 | 27,000 tons | 21 kn | 10× 14" (5×2) | Survived to 1948 |
| Gangut | Russia | 1914 | 24,800 tons | 23 kn | 12× 12" (4×3) | Scrapped 1950s |

**Analysis:** Orion set pattern but quickly superseded by faster, more powerful designs.

## Legacy

**First Super-Dreadnoughts:**
- Established 13.5-inch gun as new standard
- All-centerline turret arrangement became norm
- "Super-dreadnought" term originated with this class
- Influenced all subsequent battleship design

**Design Evolution:**
- Led directly to Iron Duke-class (improved Orion)
- Turret arrangement copied by Queen Elizabeth-class
- Centerline layout used on all later British battleships
- Set template for WWI battleships

**WWI Service:**
- Stable, reliable Grand Fleet battleships
- All survived war undamaged
- Demonstrated super-dreadnought effectiveness
- Deterrent against German High Seas Fleet

**Rapid Obsolescence:**
- 13.5-inch guns outclassed by 15-inch (Queen Elizabeth)
- 21-knot speed inadequate by 1918
- Oil-fired ships more efficient
- Demonstrated rapid technological change

**HMS Monarch Target Practice:**
- Demonstrated improvements in naval gunnery 1912-1925
- Tested modern weapons systems
- Valuable data for naval designers
- Survived full day of bombardment before sinking
