# Invincible-Class Battlecruisers (1908)

## Overview
The Invincible-class were the world's first battlecruisers, revolutionary warships combining battleship firepower (8× 12-inch guns) with cruiser speed (25 knots). Three ships commissioned 1908 as Admiral Fisher's vision: "speed is armor" - fast enough to catch cruisers, powerful enough to destroy them. HMS Invincible and Inflexible annihilated German cruisers at Battle of Falklands (1914). However, inadequate armor proved fatal at Jutland: HMS Invincible exploded (31 May 1916) with only 6 survivors from 1,032 crew. Survivors scrapped 1920-1922.

## Admiral Fisher's Revolutionary Concept

**"Speed is Armor":**
- Admiral Sir John "Jacky" Fisher's vision
- Same firepower as battleship (Dreadnought: 10× 12-inch; Invincible: 8× 12-inch)
- Cruiser speed: 25 knots (vs 21 knots for battleships)
- Could catch any cruiser, outrun any battleship
- Trade armor for speed

**Design Philosophy:**
- Hunt and destroy armored cruisers
- Scout for battle fleet
- Superior firepower overwhelms enemy before they can respond
- Fast enough to avoid powerful opponents
- "Neither cruiser nor battleship but better than both"

**World's First Battlecruisers:**
- Invincible laid down 1906, completed 1908
- Revolutionary concept
- Inspired German, Japanese, and other nations
- Created new capital ship category

## WWI Service & Major Battles

### Battle of Heligoland Bight (28 August 1914)

**First Major Naval Action of WWI:**
- All three Invincible-class participated
- Distant support to light forces
- Invincible and Indomitable in action
- Demonstrated speed and firepower
- German light cruisers SMS Mainz and Köln sunk
- British victory

### Battle of the Falkland Islands (8 December 1914)

**Greatest Battlecruiser Victory:**
- **HMS Invincible** (flagship Vice-Admiral Sturdee)
- **HMS Inflexible**
- Pursued and destroyed German East Asia Squadron

**German Squadron Annihilated:**
- **SMS Scharnhorst** sunk by Invincible
- **SMS Gneisenau** sunk by Inflexible
- SMS Nürnberg, Leipzig, Dresden sunk by cruisers
- Over 2,000 German casualties
- Only 215 survivors (including 10 from Gneisenau)

**Invincible-Class Performance:**
- 25-knot speed caught German armored cruisers (22 knots)
- 12-inch guns outranged German 8.2-inch guns
- Fired from beyond German range
- Took ~22 hits but no serious damage
- Vindicated Fisher's battlecruiser concept

**Strategic Impact:**
- Destroyed last German overseas squadron
- Avenged Battle of Coronel (1 November 1914)
- Secured South Atlantic and Pacific
- Demonstrated battlecruiser superiority over armored cruisers

### Dardanelles Campaign (1915)

**HMS Inflexible:**
- Supported landings at Gallipoli
- Shore bombardment missions
- **18 March 1915:** Struck mine
- Heavy damage, flooded compartments
- Withdrew for repairs
- Demonstrated vulnerability

**HMS Indomitable:**

- Avoided mine damage

### Battle of Jutland (31 May 1916)

**HMS Invincible - Catastrophic Loss:**
- Flagship of Rear-Admiral Horace Hood (3rd Battlecruiser Squadron)
- Engaged SMS Lützow and Derfflinger
- **17:31:** Scored hits on Lützow
- **17:33:** Hit by salvo from Lützow and/or Derfflinger
- **Shell penetrated "Q" turret roof**
- **Magazine exploded**
- **Ship broke in half in 90 seconds**
- Bow and stern sections remained vertical, keel upward
- **1,026 killed, only 6 survivors**

**HMS Inflexible:**
- Engaged German battlecruisers
- Fired 88× 12-inch shells
- Hit SMS Von der Tann
- **Not hit** - escaped damage
- Survived battle

**HMS Indomitable:**
- Engaged German ships
- Sustained some damage but survived
- Less heavily engaged than Invincible

**Tragic Irony:**
- Name "Invincible" proved tragically ironic
- Third British battlecruiser lost at Jutland (after Indefatigable and Queen Mary)
- Exposed critical design flaw

## Fatal Design Flaw

**Inadequate Armor Protection:**
- Belt: Only 6-4 inches (vs 12+ inches on battleships)
- Deck: Only 2.5-1 inches (insufficient vs plunging fire)
- Turret roof: Only 7 inches (penetrated at Jutland)
- Magazine protection inadequate

**"Speed is Armor" Failed:**
- Shells hit regardless of speed
- Inadequate protection fatal
- Magazine explosions catastrophic
- Design philosophy fundamentally flawed at Jutland

**Magazine Vulnerability:**
- Exposed cordite handling
- Flash protection insufficient
- One turret hit could destroy entire ship
- Later battlecruisers improved but never adequate

**Beatty's Famous Quote:**
- "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today"
- After Queen Mary and Indefatigable exploded
- Invincible exploded 3 hours later
- Three battlecruisers lost in one day

## Post-War Fate

**HMS Inflexible:**
- Survived Jutland undamaged
- Placed in reserve 1919
- Obsolete by war's end
- Sold for scrap 1 December 1921

**HMS Indomitable:**
- Survived Jutland with minor damage
- Placed in reserve 1919
- Sold for scrap 2 December 1922
- Last Invincible-class scrapped

**HMS Invincible Wreck:**
- Lies in 180 feet of water, North Sea
- Bow and stern sections remain vertical
- Designated war grave
- Protected site
- Visited by survey ships
- 1,026 men still entombed

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Class | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Armor (belt) | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|--------------|------|
| **Invincible** | UK | 1908 | 17,420 tons | 25 kn | 8× 12" | 6-4" | 1 sunk Jutland, 2 scrapped |
| Von der Tann | Germany | 1910 | 21,300 tons | 25 kn | 8× 11" | 9.8-4" | Survived Jutland, scuttled 1919 |
| Moltke | Germany | 1911 | 25,400 tons | 25 kn | 10× 11" | 10.5-3" | Survived Jutland, scuttled 1919 |
| Ibuki | Japan | 1909 | 15,595 tons | 21 kn | 4× 12", 8× 8" | 7" | Armored cruiser (pre-battlecruiser) |

**Analysis:** Invincible-class pioneered battlecruiser concept but inadequate armor vs later German battlecruisers.

## Legacy

**Revolutionary Ship Type:**
- World's first battlecruisers
- Established new capital ship category
- Influenced all later designs
- Inspired German, Japanese, US battlecruisers

**Falklands Victory:**
- Demonstrated battlecruiser superiority over armored cruisers
- 12-inch guns vs 8.2-inch guns decisive
- Speed caught slower German ships
- Vindicated Fisher's concept

**Jutland Tragedy:**
- Exposed fatal design flaw
- HMS Invincible loss demonstrated inadequate protection
- 1,026 men killed in 90 seconds
- Worst British battlecruiser loss

**Lessons Learned:**
- Protection cannot be sacrificed for speed
- Magazine safety critical
- Flash protection essential
- Informed later battlecruiser designs

**Fisher's Legacy:**
- Brilliant concept, flawed execution
- "Speed is armor" worked vs cruisers, not battlecruisers/battleships
- Later battlecruisers (Lion, Hood) better protected
- Concept eventually abandoned

## HMS Invincible - Remembered

**Battle of Falklands Hero:**
- Flagship of victory
- Destroyed Scharnhorst
- Greatest hour of class

**Jutland Victim:**
- 1,026 men lost
- Only 6 survivors
