# Indefatigable-Class Battlecruisers (1911)

## Overview
The Indefatigable-class were improved Invincible-class battlecruisers, featuring slightly better armor and heavier displacement. Three ships commissioned 1911-1913: HMS Indefatigable (RN), HMS New Zealand (gift from New Zealand), and HMAS Australia (Royal Australian Navy flagship). HMS Indefatigable catastrophically exploded at Jutland (31 May 1916) with only 3 survivors from 1,019 crew - first British battlecruiser lost that day. HMAS Australia missed Jutland due to collision damage. HMS New Zealand survived WWI and scrapped 1922-1923. HMAS Australia scuttled 1924 under Washington Naval Treaty.

## Comparison to Predecessors

| Feature | Invincible-Class | Indefatigable-Class |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Displacement | 17,420 tons | 18,750 tons |
| Length | 567 ft | 590 ft |
| Armament | 8× 12-inch | 8× 12-inch (same) |
| Speed | 25 knots | 25 knots (same) |
| Armor (belt) | 6-4 inches | 6-4 inches (similar) |
| Built | 1908 | 1911-1913 |
