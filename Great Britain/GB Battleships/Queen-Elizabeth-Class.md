# Queen Elizabeth-Class Battleships (1915)

## Overview
The Queen Elizabeth-class were revolutionary fast battleships that combined heavy 15-inch guns, high speed (24 knots), and strong armor protection. Described in Jane's Fighting Ships (1919) as "the most successful type of capital ship yet designed," they were the first fast battleships and served with distinction in both World Wars. All five ships fought at Jutland (WWI) and continued service through WWII, with HMS Warspite earning more battle honours than any other Royal Navy warship.
