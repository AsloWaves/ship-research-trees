# HMS Tiger - Battlecruiser (1914)

## Overview
HMS Tiger was a single-ship improved Lion-class battlecruiser, described by historian John Keegan as "certainly the most beautiful warship in the world then, and perhaps ever." Commissioned October 1914, she featured improved armor distribution and relocated secondary armament compared to Lion-class. She fought at Dogger Bank (1915, 6 hits, 10 killed) and Jutland (1916, 18 hits, 24 killed) but survived both battles. Most heavily armored British battlecruiser until Hood. After WWI served as gunnery training ship, then briefly replaced Hood (1929-1931) in Battlecruiser Squadron during Hood's refit. Scrapped 1932 under London Naval Treaty - last WWI battlecruiser to go.

## Comparison to Lion-Class

| Feature | Lion-Class | HMS Tiger |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Ships | 3 (Lion, Princess Royal, Queen Mary) | 1 (Tiger) |
| Commissioned | 1912-1913 | 1914 |
| Displacement | 26,350 tons | 28,430 tons (larger) |
| Speed | 27 knots | 28 knots (faster) |
| Main Guns | 8× 13.5" | 8× 13.5" (same) |
| Secondary | 16× 4" | 12× 6" (better) |
| Armor (belt) | 9" | 9" (better distributed) |
| "Q" Turret | Amidships | Aft of funnel (better) |
| Jutland | 1 sunk (Queen Mary) | Survived |
| Fate | Scrapped 1922-1924 | Scrapped 1932 (last) |

**Analysis:** Tiger represented incremental but important improvements over Lion-class.

## Comparison to Hood

| Feature | HMS Tiger | HMS Hood |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Commissioned | 1914 | 1920 |
| Displacement | 28,430 tons | 42,670 tons |
| Speed | 28 knots | 32 knots |
| Main Guns | 8× 13.5" | 8× 15" |
| Armor (belt) | 9" | 12" |
| Design | WWI battlecruiser | Post-WWI improved |
| Fate | Scrapped 1932 | Sunk 1941 (Bismarck) |
| Service Life | 17 years | 21 years |

**Analysis:** Hood represented quantum leap over Tiger; Tiger obsolete by Hood's completion.
