# Nelson-Class Battleships (1927)

## Overview
The Nelson-class were the Royal Navy's first and only battleships built under Washington Naval Treaty limitations (35,000 tons, 16-inch guns maximum). Featuring an unusual all-forward turret arrangement derived from the cancelled G3 battlecruiser design, they carried nine 16-inch guns - the most powerful armament of any British battleship. HMS Rodney gained fame for her decisive role in sinking the Bismarck in May 1941.

## Design Features

**All-Forward Turret Arrangement:**
- All three 16-inch triple turrets forward of superstructure
- Derived from cancelled G3 battlecruiser design
- Advantages: Concentrated armor, reduced citadel length
- Disadvantages: Poor stern fire, top-heavy

**16-inch Guns (BL 16-inch Mk I):**
- Only RN battleships with triple turrets
- Guns originally ordered for G3 battlecruisers
- 2,048 lb shells at 2,586 ft/s
- Maximum range: 35,000 yards
- Followed German practice: lighter shell, higher velocity

**Treaty Compliance:**
- Designed to Washington Treaty limits (35,000 tons, 16-inch guns)
- Sacrificed speed (23 knots) for firepower and armor
- Thick armor (14-inch belt, 6.25-inch deck)

- Rodney: Relatively undamaged throughout war

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Unique all-forward turret arrangement never repeated
- Effective within treaty limits
- Slow speed (23 knots) a limitation
- Heavy armor well-suited for Atlantic operations

**Combat Record:**
- HMS Rodney: Famous for Bismarck action
- Both ships: Extensive bombardment service
- Survived WWII but worn out

**Influence:**
- Proved treaty battleships viable
- Demonstrated triple turret effectiveness
- Influenced French Dunkerque-class layout
