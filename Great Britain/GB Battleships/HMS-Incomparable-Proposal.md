# HMS Incomparable - Battlecruiser Proposal (1915)

## Overview
HMS Incomparable was Admiral "Jackie" Fisher's most ambitious battlecruiser proposal - a 48,000-ton monster with 6× 20-inch guns (largest ever proposed for any warship) and 35-knot speed. Proposed 1915 as part of Fisher's Baltic invasion scheme, it would have dwarfed all existing warships. However, the design never progressed beyond preliminary sketches and calculations. Battle of Jutland (1916) where three British battlecruisers exploded killed the concept entirely - proving Fisher's "speed is armor" doctrine fatally flawed. The proposal was abandoned as impractical, unaffordable, and tactically unsound.

## Admiral Fisher's Vision

**"Speed is Armor" - Extreme Version:**
- Admiral Sir John "Jackie" Fisher's ultimate battlecruiser
- Larger, faster, more heavily armed than anything afloat
- Trade armor for unprecedented speed and firepower
- Catch any enemy, outrun any threat
- Pure expression of Fisher's battlecruiser philosophy

**Design Concept:**
- Speed: 35 knots (faster than any capital ship)
- Firepower: 6× 20-inch guns (largest ever proposed)
- Size: 48,000 tons (larger than any battleship then built)
- Armor: Minimal (6-4 inches belt)
- "Glass cannon" taken to extreme

**Fisher's Rationale:**
- Speed allows choosing engagement range
- Huge guns destroy enemies before they can respond
- No enemy could catch or fight Incomparable
- Perfect for Baltic operations
- Intimidation factor immense

## 20-Inch Guns - Largest Ever Proposed

**Unprecedented Armament:**
- **6× 20-inch/45 cal guns** in 3 twin turrets
- Larger than 18.1-inch guns on Yamato (largest ever built)
- No 20-inch naval gun ever manufactured
- Shell weight: ~3,700 lbs (estimated)
- Muzzle velocity: ~2,500 fps (estimated)
- Range: 40,000+ yards (estimated)

**Turret Arrangement:**
- 2× twin turrets forward (super-firing)
- 1× twin turret aft
- All centerline
- "A"-"B"-"Y" configuration

**Technical Challenges:**
- No manufacturing capability for 20-inch guns
- Turret mechanisms unproven
- Recoil forces enormous
- Loading mechanisms complex
- Weight distribution problematic

**Comparison:**
- Dreadnought (1906): 12-inch guns
- Lion-class (1912): 13.5-inch guns
- Queen Elizabeth (1915): 15-inch guns
- HMS Hood (1920): 15-inch guns
- Yamato (1941): 18.1-inch guns (largest actually built)
- **Incomparable (proposed 1915): 20-inch guns**

## Baltic Project Connection

**Fisher's Baltic Scheme:**
- Amphibious invasion of Baltic coast
- Land British army 90 miles from Berlin
- Knock Germany out of war
- Required shallow-draft, fast, heavily-armed ships

**Incomparable's Role:**
- Shore bombardment with 20-inch guns
- Destroy coastal fortifications
- Support amphibious landings
- Terrorize German coast
- Draw German forces from Western Front

**Other Baltic Project Ships:**
- Courageous-class large light cruisers (actually built)
- Multiple monitors
- Specialized landing craft
- Shallow-draft battleships

**Why Baltic Project Failed:**
- German minefields extensive
- Torpedo defenses strong
- Risk too great
- Dardanelles disaster (1915) showed dangers
- Churchill and Fisher disagreed
- Project abandoned

## Why It Was Never Built

### 1. Never Reached Design Stage

**Preliminary Only:**
- Only rough sketches and calculations
- No detailed plans
- No hull designs
- No structural engineering
- Never formally proposed to Admiralty
- Fisher's personal project

### 2. Technical Impracticality

**Massive Technical Challenges:**
- 20-inch guns never developed
- Turret machinery untested
- Propulsion system unproven (200,000+ shp unprecedented)
- Hull stresses enormous
- Stability questionable
- Armor scheme inadequate

**Manufacturing Limitations:**
- No facilities to build 20-inch guns
- No slipway large enough (1,000+ feet)
- Years of development needed
- Massive investment required

### 3. Cost Prohibitive

**Enormous Expense:**
- £5-10 million estimated (vs £2-3 million for battleship)
- Could build 3-4 battleships for same cost
- Resources better spent elsewhere
- Wartime economy strained
- Better uses for steel and labor

### 4. Battle of Jutland (31 May 1916)

**Death Blow to Concept:**
- **HMS Indefatigable** exploded (1,016 killed)
- **HMS Queen Mary** exploded (1,266 killed)
- **HMS Invincible** exploded (1,026 killed)
- Three British battlecruisers destroyed in one day
- Inadequate armor proved fatal
- "Speed is armor" doctrine shattered

**Lesson Learned:**
- Protection cannot be sacrificed for speed
- Magazine safety critical
- Armor essential vs plunging fire
- Battlecruiser concept fundamentally flawed
- Turn toward fast battleships instead

### 5. Strategic Irrelevance

**No Valid Mission:**
- Baltic project abandoned
- No enemy required such firepower
- No tactical role identified
- Vulnerable to mines, torpedoes, submarines
- One lucky torpedo could sink £10 million investment
- Risk vs reward unacceptable

### 6. Fisher's Departure

**Loss of Champion:**
- Fisher resigned First Sea Lord May 1915 (Dardanelles dispute)
- No champion for Incomparable
- Project died with Fisher's influence
- Successors had different priorities

## Comparison to What Was Actually Built

| Ship | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Armor (belt) | Status |
|------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Incomparable** | Proposed 1915 | 48,000 tons | 35 kn | 6× 20" | 6-4" | Never built |
| Hood | 1920 | 42,670 tons | 32 kn | 8× 15" | 12" | Built, sunk 1941 |
| Vanguard | 1946 | 44,500 tons | 30 kn | 8× 15" | 14" | Built, scrapped 1960 |
| Yamato | 1941 | 65,000 tons | 27 kn | 9× 18.1" | 16.1" | Built (Japan), sunk 1945 |
| Iowa | 1943 | 45,000 tons | 33 kn | 9× 16" | 12.1" | Built (USA), museum |

**Analysis:** Incomparable would have been larger than Hood, faster than Yamato, but totally impractical.

## If It Had Been Built - Hypothetical Assessment

**Potential Strengths:**
- Fastest capital ship in world (35 knots)
- Most powerful guns afloat (20-inch)
- Intimidation factor enormous
- Could destroy any ship at extreme range
- No ship could catch it

**Fatal Weaknesses:**
- Minimal armor (6-4 inches belt)
- One magazine hit = catastrophic explosion
- Vulnerable to torpedoes
- Vulnerable to mines
- Vulnerable to submarines
- Huge target
- Massive cost vs limited utility

**Likely Fate:**
- If built and used at Jutland: **Almost certainly destroyed**
- Thin armor like Indefatigable/Queen Mary/Invincible
- Would have exploded from plunging fire
- Loss would have been catastrophic (£10 million + 1,500 crew)

**Strategic Impact:**
- If lost: Huge blow to British morale and resources
- If survived: Limited utility post-Jutland
- Too valuable to risk
- Would likely spend war in port
- "Fleet in being" with no actual purpose

## Design Assessment - Why It Was Absurd

**Extreme "Speed is Armor":**
- Taken to logical extreme
- Proved fatally flawed at Jutland
- No armor = magazine explosion risk
- Fast but fragile
- One hit could doom ship

**Scale Problems:**
- 48,000 tons unprecedented in 1915
- Structural challenges enormous
- Stability questionable
- Maneuvering difficult
- Dry dock facilities inadequate

**Gun Problems:**
- 20-inch guns never developed
- Manufacturing impossible in timeframe
- Shell production problematic
- Recoil forces unprecedented
- Loading mechanisms untested

**Cost vs Benefit:**
- Cost of 3-4 battleships
- Utility of 1 (questionable)
- Risk enormous
- Better to build proven designs
- Resources wasted

## Legacy

**Fisher's Last Battlecruiser Dream:**
- Ultimate expression of Fisher's philosophy
- Never progressed beyond concept
- Demonstrated limits of battlecruiser concept
- Jutland proved him wrong

**Largest Warship Never Built:**
- 48,000 tons in 1915 was absurd
- Not exceeded until Yamato (1941)
- Vanguard (1946) barely matched displacement
- Shows ambition of British designers

**20-Inch Guns Never Realized:**
- Largest guns proposed but never built
- Yamato's 18.1-inch closest approach
- Technical limits of gun development
- Impractical for naval use

**Lesson in Naval Design:**
- Balance essential: armor, speed, firepower
- Extremes don't work
- Practical > theoretical
- Cost matters
- Mission must justify design

**Alternative History:**
- Popular subject for naval historians
- "What if" scenarios
- Likely would have been disaster
- Probably would have exploded at Jutland
- Better never built
