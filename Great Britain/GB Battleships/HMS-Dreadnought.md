# HMS Dreadnought (1906)

## Overview
HMS Dreadnought was a revolutionary battleship commissioned by the Royal Navy in 1906 that gave her name to an entire generation of capital ships. Her design was so advanced that she rendered all existing battleships obsolete overnight, dividing naval history into "pre-dreadnought" and "dreadnought" eras. The ship featured an all-big-gun armament of ten 12-inch guns and steam turbine propulsion, making her faster and more powerful than any contemporary battleship. During World War I, she achieved the unique distinction of being the only battleship in history to sink a submarine by ramming (U-29 in 1915).

## Revolutionary Design

### The "All-Big-Gun" Concept

HMS Dreadnought's most revolutionary feature was her **uniform main battery** of ten 12-inch guns, abandoning the mixed-caliber approach of pre-dreadnought battleships:

**Previous battleships** (Pre-Dreadnought Era):
- 4× 12-inch heavy guns
- 12-16× 6-inch or 9.2-inch secondary guns
- Multiple smaller guns

**HMS Dreadnought:**
- 10× 12-inch guns (all main caliber)
- 27× 3-inch guns (anti-torpedo boat only)
- Single-caliber main battery simplified fire control

**Advantages:**
1. **Firepower:** All ten 12-inch guns could engage capital ships
2. **Fire control:** Single range and ballistic calculation
3. **Ammunition:** Simplified logistics (only 12-inch shells for main battery)
4. **Salvo firing:** All guns aimed at single target
5. **Range:** Entire main battery effective at long range (16,000+ yards)

### Steam Turbine Propulsion

Dreadnought was the **first major warship with steam turbines** instead of reciprocating engines:

**Powerplant:**
- 2× paired direct-drive turbines
- 4× propeller shafts
- 18× Babcock & Wilcox boilers (250 psi)
- 23,000 shaft horsepower

**Advantages over Reciprocating Engines:**
1. **Higher speed:** 21+ knots vs 18 knots (contemporary battleships)
2. **Smoother operation:** Less vibration
3. **Better fuel economy:** At cruising speeds
4. **Lighter weight:** Turbines lighter than reciprocating engines
5. **More reliable:** Fewer moving parts

**Disadvantages:**
- Poor fuel economy at low speeds (direct-drive turbines)
- Difficult to reverse (required separate reverse turbines)
- New technology (unproven in large warships)

### Rapid Construction

HMS Dreadnought was built with unprecedented speed:

- **Laid down:** 2 October 1905
- **Launched:** 10 February 1906 (**4 months**)
- **Commissioned:** 2 December 1906 (**1 year total**)

This rapid construction was possible because:
1. **Pre-fabrication:** Components built before keel laid
2. **Experienced workforce:** Portsmouth Dockyard specialists
3. **Priority:** Highest-priority project
4. **Simplified design:** No complex mixed armament
5. **Admiral Fisher's drive:** First Sea Lord pushed for speed

**Comparison:**
- Contemporary battleships: 2-3 years construction
- Dreadnought: 1 year construction
- **Result:** Strategic surprise to other navies

## Design History

### Origins and Admiral Fisher

HMS Dreadnought was the brainchild of **Admiral Sir John "Jacky" Fisher**, First Sea Lord (1904-1910):

**Fisher's Vision:**
1. **Speed:** Fast battleships to dominate the fleet
2. **Firepower:** All-big-gun armament
3. **Simplification:** Single-caliber main battery
4. **Technology:** Steam turbines for reliability and speed

**Committee on Designs (December 1904):**
Fisher established a committee to design the new battleship:
- Admiral Sir John Fisher (chairman)
- Naval constructors and gunnery experts
- First sketch approved **15 January 1905**

**Design Influences:**
1. **Battle of Tsushima (1905):** Japanese victory showed importance of long-range gunnery
2. **HMS Untakeable (design study):** All-big-gun concept from 1904
3. **Italian Vittorio Cuniberti:** Published all-big-gun concept (1903)
4. **US South Carolina-class:** Simultaneous all-big-gun design (authorized 1905, built later)

### Main Armament Layout

The ten 12-inch guns were arranged in five twin turrets:

**Turret Arrangement:**
- **"A" Turret:** Forward centerline (superfiring)
- **"B" Turret:** Forward centerline (low)
- **"P" Turret:** Port wing (amidships)
- **"Q" Turret:** Starboard wing (amidships)
- **"X" Turret:** Aft centerline (superfiring)
- **"Y" Turret:** Aft centerline (low) - **REMOVED 1916-1918**

**Fire Arcs:**
- **Forward fire:** 6 guns ("A", "B", "P", "Q" when trained forward)
- **Broadside:** 8 guns (all except turret on opposite side)
- **Aft fire:** 6 guns ("P" or "Q", "X", "Y")

**Note:** The amidships wing turrets ("P" and "Q") had limited fire arcs and were controversial. This layout was not repeated in later British dreadnoughts.

### 12-Inch Gun Specifications

**BL 12-inch Mark X gun:**
- **Caliber:** 12 inches (305mm) / 45 caliber
- **Barrel length:** 45 feet (540 inches)
- **Shell weight:** 850 pounds (386 kg)
- **Muzzle velocity:** 2,725 ft/s (830 m/s)
- **Maximum range:** 18,850 yards (armor-piercing shells)
- **Rate of fire:** ~2 rounds per minute
- **Ammunition:** 80 rounds per gun (800 total)

**Turret Details:**
- **Mark BVIII twin turret**
- **Armor:** 11-inch face, 8-inch sides, 3-inch roof
- **Training:** Hydraulic power
- **Elevation:** -3° to +13.5° (original), later increased

### Armor Protection

HMS Dreadnought used **Krupp cemented armor** throughout:

**Main Belt:**
- **11 inches** thick (amidships, protecting machinery and magazines)
- **8 inches** upper belt
- **7 inches** lower edge of main belt
- **6 inches** forward extension
- **4 inches** aft extension

**Turrets and Barbettes:**
- **11 inches** turret faces
- **8 inches** turret sides

**Deck Armor:**
- **3 inches** over magazines
- **1.5 inches** over machinery
- **0.75 inches** elsewhere

**Conning Tower:**
- **11 inches** sides
- **3 inches** roof

**Protection Philosophy:**
The armor scheme was designed to resist 12-inch shells at battle ranges (8,000-12,000 yards), reflecting contemporary naval doctrine.

## Service History

### Pre-War Service (1906-1914)

**1906-1911: Home Fleet Flagship**

HMS Dreadnought was commissioned as **Flagship of the Home Fleet** on 2 December 1906, reflecting her status as the most powerful warship afloat.

**Key Events:**
- **1907:** Home Fleet exercises, training new all-big-gun tactics
- **1909:** Fire control system upgrades, experimental director firing tested
- **1910:** **"Dreadnought Hoax"** - Horace de Vere Cole arranged fake tour by "Abyssinian royals" (including Virginia Woolf in disguise), embarrassing the Royal Navy
- **1911:** Participated in **King George V's Coronation Fleet Review** (June 1911)

**1911-1914: 1st Battle Squadron**

By 1911, newer super-dreadnoughts (Orion, King George V classes) with 13.5-inch guns had eclipsed Dreadnought. She was reassigned to:
- **1911:** 1st Battle Squadron, Home Fleet
- **1912:** 4th Battle Squadron, based at Scapa Flow

### World War I (1914-1918)

**1914-1915: North Sea Operations**

At the outbreak of WWI, Dreadnought served with the **4th Battle Squadron, Grand Fleet** at Scapa Flow.

**Operations:**
- **August 1914:** Grand Fleet mobilization, North Sea patrols
- **1914-1915:** Numerous North Sea sweeps searching for German High Seas Fleet
- **Battle of Jutland (1916):** **MISSED** - undergoing refit at the time

**18 March 1915: Sinking of U-29 (Unique Achievement)**

HMS Dreadnought achieved a **unique distinction** in naval history:

**Incident:**
- **Location:** Pentland Firth (between Scotland and Orkney Islands)
- **Enemy:** German submarine **SM U-29** (Type U 27)
- **Action:** Dreadnought **rammed and sank** U-29
- **Result:** U-29 sunk with all hands (36 crew lost)
- **Significance:** **Only battleship in history to purposefully sink a submarine**

**Details:**
U-29 had just sunk HMS Dryad (minesweeper) and surfaced to observe the wreckage. Dreadnought, steaming at high speed, sighted the submarine and altered course to ram. The battleship's bow struck U-29 amidships, cutting the submarine in two. The wreck of U-29 was later found at the bottom of Pentland Firth.

**Irony:**
The world's first all-big-gun turbine battleship, designed to fight other battleships at long range with 12-inch guns, achieved her only "kill" by ramming - a tactic from the age of galleys.

**1916: Refit and Jutland**

Dreadnought underwent a **major refit** in early 1916:

**Modifications:**
- Aft centerline turret **"Y" removed** (to improve stability and reduce weight)
- Anti-aircraft guns added (QF 3-inch 20 cwt)
- Fire control upgraded (director firing system likely installed)
- Armor and protection improvements

**Battle of Jutland (31 May 1916):**
Dreadnought **missed the battle** due to her refit. This was fortunate - her older 12-inch guns and slower speed would have been at a disadvantage against German dreadnoughts with 11-inch and 12-inch guns.

**1916-1918: Coastal Defense and Reserve**

After her refit, Dreadnought's role diminished:

- **July 1916:** Assigned to **coastal defense duties** (English Channel)
- **1916-1918:** Reserve Fleet and training duties
- **March 1918:** Rejoined Grand Fleet briefly
- **7 August 1918:** **Paid off** (decommissioned)
- **February 1919:** Recommissioned as **tender** (non-operational support ship)

### Post-War and Scrapping

**Disposal:**
- **31 March 1920:** Put up for sale
- **9 May 1921:** Sold to **Thos. W. Ward** for scrapping
- **Sale price:** Approximately **£36,630** (about 2% of original cost)
- **2 January 1923:** Arrived at **Inverkeithing, Scotland** for breaking up

**Final Fate:**
HMS Dreadnought was scrapped in 1923, less than 17 years after commissioning. By that time, she was thoroughly obsolete - surpassed by super-dreadnoughts with larger guns, thicker armor, and higher speeds.

## Impact and Legacy

### Naval Revolution

HMS Dreadnought's launch triggered the greatest naval arms race in history:

**Immediate Impact (1906):**
- **All existing battleships rendered obsolete** overnight
- **New terminology:** Ships became "dreadnoughts" vs "pre-dreadnoughts"
- **International panic:** Every major navy forced to build dreadnoughts
- **Strategic reset:** Pre-1906 naval superiority no longer mattered

**International Response:**
| Nation | Response | First Dreadnought |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Germany** | Immediate rival construction | Nassau (1908) |
| **United States** | Authorized South Carolina class | South Carolina (1910) |
| **Japan** | Aki and Satsuma classes | Satsuma (1910) |
| **France** | Courbet class | Courbet (1913) |
| **Italy** | Dante Alighieri | Dante Alighieri (1913) |
| **Russia** | Gangut class | Gangut (1914) |
| **Austria-Hungary** | Viribus Unitis class | Viribus Unitis (1912) |

### Anglo-German Naval Race

Dreadnought sparked the most intense naval rivalry:

**British Construction (1906-1914):**
- 22 dreadnought battleships
- 10 battlecruisers
- Total: 32 capital ships

**German Construction (1906-1914):**
- 15 dreadnought battleships
- 5 battlecruisers
- Total: 20 capital ships

**Political Impact:**
- Strained Anglo-German relations
- Major cause of diplomatic tensions before WWI
- "We want eight and we won't wait!" (British public demand for dreadnoughts, 1909)
- Massive financial burden on both nations

### Technological Legacy

HMS Dreadnought established principles that defined battleship design for 40 years:

**Design Principles Established:**
1. **All-big-gun armament** - Became universal standard
2. **Uniform main battery** - Simplified fire control
3. **Steam turbines** - Became standard propulsion
4. **Superfiring turrets** - Maximized firepower
5. **Thick armor belt** - Protected vital spaces
6. **Long-range gunnery** - Fire control systems evolved

**Evolution from Dreadnought:**
- **1906:** Dreadnought - 10× 12-inch guns
- **1909:** Bellerophon class - 10× 12-inch (improved)
- **1910:** Orion class - 10× 13.5-inch guns
- **1915:** Queen Elizabeth class - 8× 15-inch guns
- **1916:** Hood - 8× 15-inch guns, 31 knots
- **1940:** King George V class - 10× 14-inch guns (treaty limit)

### Cultural Impact

HMS Dreadnought became synonymous with naval power:

**The Name:**
- "Dreadnought" = "fear nothing"
- Became generic term for all-big-gun battleships
- Used to describe any revolutionary weapon or technology
- Modern usage: "dreadnought guitar" (large body acoustic guitar)

**Famous Incidents:**
1. **Dreadnought Hoax (1910):** Virginia Woolf and friends posed as "Abyssinian royals" and were given official tour, embarrassing the Navy
2. **"Dreadnought Fever":** Public fascination with the ship
3. **Naval propaganda:** Symbol of British maritime supremacy

**Namesakes:**
- **HMS Dreadnought (S101):** First British nuclear submarine (1960-1982)
- **HMS Dreadnought:** Lead ship of future British SSBN class (2030s)
- Multiple merchant ships and tugboats named Dreadnought

- **Total:** 6 turbines driving 4 shafts

**Performance:**
- **Ahead:** High and low pressure turbines drove inner and outer shafts
- **Astern:** Separate reverse turbines on inner shafts only
- **Efficiency:** Good at high speed, poor at low speed (direct drive)

**Fuel System:**
- Coal primary fuel: 2,868 tons
- Oil fuel for spraying: 1,120 tons
- **Oil spraying:** Increased coal combustion efficiency
- **Bunker arrangement:** Coal bunkers also provided torpedo protection

## Conclusions

HMS Dreadnought was the most revolutionary warship of the 20th century. In a single leap, she rendered every existing battleship obsolete and sparked a global naval arms race. Her design principles - all-big-gun armament, steam turbine propulsion, and heavy armor - defined battleship design for the next 40 years.

**Key Achievements:**
1. **Revolutionary design:** All-big-gun, steam turbines
2. **Rapid construction:** Built in 1 year (vs 2-3 years for contemporaries)
3. **International impact:** Triggered global naval arms race
4. **Unique record:** Only battleship to sink submarine by ramming
5. **Legacy:** Name became generic term for entire class of warships

**Limitations:**
- Quickly surpassed by improved designs (13.5-inch, 15-inch guns)
- Wing turrets proved inefficient (not repeated)
- Direct-drive turbines inefficient at low speeds
- By WWI, obsolescent compared to super-dreadnoughts

**Historical Significance:**
HMS Dreadnought's significance lies not in her combat record (minimal) but in her **revolutionary impact** on naval warfare. She proved that radical innovation could instantly obsolete all existing weapons, forcing every major navy to rebuild their battle fleets. The "Dreadnought Revolution" changed naval strategy, international relations, and military technology.

The name "Dreadnought" - meaning "fear nothing" - became synonymous with revolutionary power, a fitting tribute to the ship that changed naval history forever.
