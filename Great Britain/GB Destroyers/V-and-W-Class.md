# V and W-Class Destroyers (1917)

## Overview
The V and W-class were the most numerous and successful British destroyers of WWI, with 67 ships built across six similar sub-classes. Designed for high-speed fleet operations in the North Sea, they set the standard for future destroyer design worldwide. Many served into WWII after modifications, demonstrating their excellent design. They were the best destroyers of WWI and influenced all subsequent British destroyers.

## Six Sub-Classes

**1. Admiralty V-Class Leaders (5 ships):**
- Larger flotilla leaders (1,554 tons)
- 5× 4.7-inch guns

**2. Admiralty V-Class (23 ships):**
- Most numerous sub-class
- Standard design

**3. Admiralty W-Class (19 ships):**
- Ordered December 1916
- Similar to V-class

**4. Thornycroft V and W-Class (4 ships):**
- Special designs by Thornycroft
- Higher speed

**5. Thornycroft Modified W-Class (2 ships):**
- Further improvements

**6. Admiralty Modified W-Class (7 ships):**
- January 1918 order
- 7 completed, 7 cancelled

**Total:** 60 V-class, 7 W-class variants = 67 ships

## Design Features

**Advanced for WWI:**
- 34 knots (very fast for era)
- Heavy torpedo armament (6 tubes)
- Good gun armament (4-5 guns)
- Excellent seakeeping
- Reliable machinery

**Innovations:**
- Geared turbines (fuel efficient)
- High forecastle (good seakeeping)
- Triple torpedo mounts
- Set pattern for future destroyers

## Service History

### World War I (1917-1918)

**Grand Fleet Service:**
- Escorted battle fleet
- North Sea operations
- Anti-submarine patrols
- Few saw major action (commissioned late in war)

### Interwar Period (1919-1939)

**Extensive Modifications:**
- Some converted to minelayers
- Some to anti-aircraft escorts
- Many modernized for WWII
- 40+ still in service by 1939

### World War II (1939-1945)

**Still Valuable 20+ Years Later:**
- **Atlantic:** Convoy escorts
- **Mediterranean:** Fleet operations
- **Home Waters:** Anti-submarine patrols
- **Dunkirk (1940):** Multiple V&W destroyers evacuated troops

**Losses:**
- Many lost to bombs, torpedoes, mines
- Proved still effective despite age
- Some served entire war

**Post-WWII:**
- Last V&W scrapped late 1940s
- 30-year service life (exceptional)

## Legacy

**Best WWI Destroyers:**
- Set standard for destroyer design
- Influenced British destroyers through 1945
- Proven by long service life (1917-1949)

**Design Influence:**
- A-I interwar classes based on V&W design
- Tribal and later WWII classes evolved from V&W
- Established 4-gun, 6-torpedo layout

**Longevity:**
- Designed 1916, last scrapped 1949
- **33-year service span**
- Testimony to excellent design
