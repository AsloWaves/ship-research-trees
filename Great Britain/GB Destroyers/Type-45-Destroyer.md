# Type 45 Destroyer - Daring-Class (2009)

## Overview
The Type 45 (Daring-class) are advanced air-defense destroyers built around the revolutionary SAMPSON AESA radar and Sea Viper missile system, capable of tracking 1,000 targets simultaneously. Six ships commissioned 2009-2013 represent the Royal Navy's most advanced surface combatants, designed primarily for anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare. Despite propulsion problems requiring Power Improvement Project (PIP) upgrades, they have proven highly effective in Red Sea operations against Houthi drones/missiles. Based at Portsmouth.
