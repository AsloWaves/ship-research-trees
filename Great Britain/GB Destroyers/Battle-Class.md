# Battle-Class Destroyers (1943)

## Overview
The Battle-class were large fleet destroyers designed for improved anti-aircraft defense and stability, representing the ultimate development of British WWII destroyer design. Twenty-four ships built in two groups (1943-1946), but only seven commissioned before WWII ended and only one (HMS Barfleur) saw combat. Post-war, many were modernized and served into the 1970s, with some sold to allied navies.

## Design Features

**Improved AA Capability:**
- Designed after lessons learned in WWII
- Emphasis on anti-aircraft defense
- Better stability for AA gunnery
- Dual-purpose 4.5-inch guns

**Larger Size:**
- 2,315 tons (larger than previous destroyers)
- Better seakeeping
- More internal space
- Improved crew habitability

**Two Design Groups:**
- **Group I (1942 design):** 16 ships, 4× 4.5-inch guns
- **Group II (1943 design):** 7 ships, 5× 4.5-inch guns, improved
- **Extended Design:** 2 planned (1 built as HMS Jutland, 1 cancelled)

## Construction & WWII Service

**Slow Construction:**
- Ordered 1942-1943
- Construction slow due to equipment shortages
- Low priority as war outcome assured
- Most completed post-war

**WWII Service:**
- Only **7 commissioned before VJ Day** (September 1945)
- Only **HMS Barfleur saw combat** - British Pacific Fleet
- Too late for Atlantic/Mediterranean operations
- Reduced from planned numbers

**HMS Barfleur - Only Combat:**
- Commissioned March 1944
- British Pacific Fleet 1945
- Bombardment operations against Japan
- Only Battle-class to see WWII action

## Post-War Service

**Cold War (1945-1970s):**
- Served as fleet destroyers
- NATO operations
- Training ships
- Reserve fleet

**Modernizations:**
- Some received radar upgrades
- AA armament updated
- Fire control improvements
- Sonar additions

**Korean War (1950-1953):**
- Several Battle-class served
- Shore bombardment
- Screening duties
- Demonstrated continued relevance

**Suez Crisis (1956):**
- Multiple Battle-class participated
- Shore bombardment
- Fleet screening

## Ships Sold to Allied Navies

**Pakistan Navy:**
- HMS Cadiz → PNS Khaibar
- HMS Gabbard → PNS Badr

**Royal Australian Navy:**
- HMS Anzac (built for RAN)
- HMS Tobruk (built for RAN)

## Notable Ships

**HMS Barfleur (D80):**
- Only Battle-class to see WWII combat
- British Pacific Fleet 1945
- Korean War service
- Scrapped 1966

**HMS Armada (D14):**
- Flagship duties
- Mediterranean Fleet
- Scrapped 1965

**HMS St. Kitts (later Jutland) (D82):**
- Only "extended" Battle-class completed
- Larger design with 5× 4.5-inch guns
- Scrapped 1965

## Decommissioning

**1960s-1970s:**
- Most scrapped 1960s
- Replaced by County-class guided missile destroyers
- Some served into early 1970s
- Last scrapped ~1975

**Service Life:**
- Average 15-20 years
- Shorter than intended (rapid technological change)
- Superseded by guided missile ships

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Excellent sea boats
- Good AA capability
- Too late for WWII
- Successful post-war destroyers

**Ultimate WWII Destroyer:**
- Represented peak conventional destroyer design
- Last gun-armed fleet destroyers
- Superseded by missile ships

**Influence:**
- Design influenced post-war destroyers
- Daring-class evolved from Battle-class
- Established large destroyer size trend
