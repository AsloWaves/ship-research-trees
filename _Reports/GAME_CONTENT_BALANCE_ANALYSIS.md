## 1. SHIPS - NATION COMPARISON

### Total Ships by Nation

| Nation         | Total Ships | Battleships | Carriers | Cruisers | Destroyers | Submarines | Other |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|------------|------------|-------|
| **USA**        | 247         | 25          | 26       | 49       | 32         | 61         | 54    |
| **Germany**    | 195         | 59          | 15       | 37       | 39         | 45         | 0     |
| **Great-Britain** | 177      | 32          | 20       | 46       | 45         | 34         | 0     |
| **Japan**      | 137         | 18          | 20       | 32       | 41         | 23         | 3     |
| **Total**      | **756**     | 134         | 81       | 164      | 157        | 163        | 57    |

### Ship Type Balance

#### Battleships (134 total)
- **Germany:** 59 (44%) - 🔥 **Strongest coverage**
- **Great-Britain:** 32 (24%)
- **USA:** 25 (19%)
- **Japan:** 18 (13%)

**Analysis:** Germany has excellent battleship representation (likely includes pre-dreadnoughts, WWI, WWII planned). USA and Japan have fewer but this is historically accurate (both favored fewer, more modern designs).

#### Carriers (81 total)
- **USA:** 26 (32%) - 🔥 **Strongest coverage**
- **Great-Britain:** 20 (25%)
- **Japan:** 20 (25%)
- **Germany:** 15 (18%) - ⚠️ Below average (38.5% of average)

**Analysis:** Germany's carrier count is low but historically accurate (Plan Z carriers, Graf Zeppelin). Consider adding paper designs if game needs more German carrier content.

#### Cruisers (164 total - includes all cruiser types)
- **USA:** 49 (30%)
- **Great-Britain:** 46 (28%)
- **Germany:** 37 (23%)
- **Japan:** 32 (19%)

**Analysis:** Well balanced. Japan's "Cruisers" folder only has 3 files because Japan uses Heavy-Cruisers (10) and Light-Cruisers (19) as separate categories.

#### Destroyers (157 total)
- **Great-Britain:** 45 (29%)
- **Japan:** 41 (26%) - Includes 11 modern destroyers
- **Germany:** 39 (25%)
- **USA:** 32 (20%)

**Analysis:** Excellent balance. Japan has bonus modern destroyers (11 files) for post-war content.

#### Submarines (163 total)
- **USA:** 61 (37%) - 🔥 **Strongest coverage**
- **Germany:** 45 (28%)
- **Great-Britain:** 34 (21%)
- **Japan:** 23 (14%) - Includes 3 modern submarines

**Analysis:** USA dominance reflects massive WWII submarine fleet. All nations have adequate coverage for gameplay.

### Ship Content Gaps

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Germany Carriers:** Only 15 carriers (38.5% of average) - Consider adding paper designs
2. **Japan Modern Ships:** Only 1 modern frigate, 3 modern subs - Need more JMSDF content

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** balance for Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers, and Submarines
- ⚠️ Consider adding 5-10 more German carrier designs (paper ships, conversions)
- ⚠️ Consider adding 10-15 more JMSDF modern ships (frigates, destroyers)

- **Great-Britain:** 5 (19%)

**Analysis:** Excellent balance. Japan's modern focus shows in helicopter numbers.

### Aircraft Content Gaps

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Japan Land Bombers:** 0 files - Need G4M Betty, G5N, Ki-67 for game balance
2. **Germany Naval Aviation:** 3 fighters, 3 bombers - Historically accurate but may need more for gameplay
3. **Land Reconnaissance:** Missing for Germany, partial for others

**Recommendations:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Add 5-8 Japanese land bombers (G4M, G5N, Ki-67, Ki-49)
- ⚠️ **Optional:** Add 5-10 more German naval aircraft (paper designs, captured aircraft)
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** balance for fighters, helicopters, strike aircraft
