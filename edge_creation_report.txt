HORIZONTAL MARK PROGRESSION EDGES (240 total)
----------------------------------------------
These edges connect sequential marks within the same caliber and mount type.

Example chains created:
- 3": Mk 10 → 17 → 18 → 22 → 26 → 27 → 33 → 34 (7 edges × 4 mount types = 28 edges)
- 4": Mk 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 12 (4 edges × 4 mount types = 16 edges)
- 5": Mk 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 21 → 22 → 24... (complex, multiple variants)
- 6": Mk 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18
- 8": Mk 9 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 71
- 12": Mk 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8
- 13": Mk 1 → 2
- 14": Mk 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11
- 16": Mk 1 → 2 → 2/3 → 3 → 5 → 5/8 → 6 → 7 → 8
- 18": Mk 1 (no progression, only one mark)

VERTICAL MOUNT TYPE UPGRADE EDGES (211 total)
----------------------------------------------
These edges connect different mount types within the same caliber and mark.
Pattern: Single → Twin → Triple → Quad

Examples:
- 3" Mk 10: Single → Twin → Triple → Quad (3 edges)
- 5" Mk 11: Single → Twin → Triple → Quad (3 edges)
- 16" Mk 2/3: Single → Twin → Triple → Quad (3 edges)

Not all marks have all four mount types, so vertical edges only created where applicable.

STRATEGIC CROSS-CALIBER EDGES (11 total)
-----------------------------------------
These edges show historically significant upgrade paths between different calibers.

Successfully Created:
1. 4" Mk 12 Twin → 5" Mk 7 Twin (Early DD upgrade)
2. 5" Mk 15 Twin → 5" Mk 12 Twin (Transition to DP)
3. 5" Mk 39 Twin → 5" Mk 16 Twin (WWII to Cold War)
4. 5" Mk 42 Single → 5" Mk 45 Single (Modern automation)
5. 5" Mk 15 Twin → 6" Mk 6 Twin (Light cruiser branch)
6. 6" Mk 6 Triple → 6" Mk 11 Triple (Treaty cruiser upgrade)
7. 12" Mk 8 Triple → 14" Mk 1 Triple (Dreadnought evolution)
8. 3" Mk 34 Twin → 4" Mk 7 Twin (Light AA upgrade)
9. 4" Mk 12 Twin → 5" Mk 7 Twin (Secondary battery upgrade)
10. 12" Mk 5 Twin → 13" Mk 1 Twin (Experimental heavy gun)
11. 13" Mk 2 Twin → 14" Mk 1 Twin (Standard battleship gun)

Missing (turret variants not found in database):
- 6" Mk 16 Triple → 8" Mk 9 Triple (Heavy cruiser branch)
- 14" Mk 7 Triple → 16" Mk 1 Triple (Super-battleship upgrade)
- 16" Mk 3 Triple → 16" Mk 5 Triple (Fast battleship pinnacle)
- 16" Mk 7 Triple → 18" Mk 1 Triple (Ultimate concept)
- 8" Mk 16 Triple → 12" Mk 3 Triple (Pre-dreadnought to dreadnought)

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------
1. File Formats: The script handles multiple designation formats:
   - Pattern 1: With gun length - "5"/38 Mark 24 Single Mount"
   - Pattern 2: Duplicate "Mark Mark" - "5" Mark Mark 11 Single DP Turret"
   - Pattern 3: Simple format - "16" Mark 1 Triple Turret"

2. Edge IDs: Sequential numbering from edge_0001 to edge_0462

3. Implementation: All edges are directional, showing progression from older/simpler to newer/more advanced

4. Canvas Format: Standard Obsidian canvas JSON format with nodes and edges arrays

VERIFICATION
------------
To verify edges in Obsidian:
1. Open: C:\Research\Weapons\Naval-Weapons\Naval-Weapons Tree.canvas
2. Check that turret nodes now have connecting lines showing progression paths
3. Horizontal edges show mark evolution (left-to-right typically)
4. Vertical edges show mount type upgrades (same position, different mount counts)
5. Cross-caliber edges show strategic upgrade paths between different gun sizes
