## Research Findings & Formulas

### Established Formulas (Evidence-Based)
- **Shell Length**: AP = 4.5 calibers, HC = 4.0 calibers (from 16" Mark 8 confirmed at 72" = 4.5 × 16")
- **AP Bursting Charge**: 1.5% of projectile weight (from 16" Mark 8: 40.5 lbs / 2,700 lbs = 1.5%)
- **HC Bursting Charge**: 8-10% of projectile weight (from 16" Mark 13: 154 lbs / 1,900 lbs = 8.1%)

### Cartridge Type Standards
- **Separate**: Projectile and powder bags loaded separately (calibers ≥8")
- **Semi-fixed**: Projectile attached to powder case (calibers 6"-8")
- **Fixed**: Projectile crimped to powder case (calibers ≤5")

### Armor Standards
- **Class A**: Face-hardened armor (turret faces, sides)
- **Class B**: Homogeneous armor (roofs, decks)
- **STS**: Special Treatment Steel (backing plates)

## Key Historical Findings

### 16"/50 Mark 7 (Iowa class)
- Most powerful US naval gun ever fielded
- 19.5" turret face armor (17" Class B + 2.5" STS)
- Fired 2,700 lb shells at 2,500 fps to 24 miles range
- Crew of 94 per turret (1,708 ton turret weight)

### 5"/38 Mark 12
- Most produced US naval gun (>2,000 units)
- VT proximity fuze increased AA effectiveness from 5% to 50%+
- Dual-purpose (surface and anti-aircraft)
- Fixed ammunition with 47.5" complete rounds

### 18"/48 Mark 1
- Experimental gun never completed
- Washington Naval Treaty (1922) prohibited guns >16"
- Prototype relined and finished as 16"/56 Mark 4

## Remaining Work

### Missing Data (Priority Order)
1. **Turret Crew Sizes**: 61 entries still NULL (95% missing)
2. **Turret Armor**: 57-59 entries still NULL (89-92% missing)
3. **Ammunition Bursting Charges**: 72 entries still NULL (89% missing)
4. **Ammunition Shell Lengths**: 72 entries still NULL (89% missing)
5. **Cartridge Types**: 67 entries still NULL (83% missing)
6. **Traverse/Elevation Rates**: 59-61 entries still NULL (92-95% missing)

### Research Challenges Identified
1. **Data Availability**: Not all historical data is publicly available or digitized
2. **Source Conflicts**: Different sources report conflicting specifications (especially crew sizes)
3. **Missing Records**: Some experimental/early guns have incomplete historical records
4. **Format Variations**: Data formats vary across sources (calibers vs inches, degrees vs mils)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Continue with Option 1 (exhaustive research) for remaining high-priority guns (14"-16" battleship guns)
2. Research dual-purpose guns (5"/54, 6"/53) which have better documentation
3. Apply intelligent defaults for common secondary guns where exact data is unavailable
4. Validate estimated values against multiple sources where possible

## Time Tracking

**Total Research Time**: ~8 hours
- Phase 1 (Format Fixes): ~2 hours
- Phase 2 (First 8 guns): ~4 hours
- Phase 3 (Final 2 guns): ~2 hours

**Estimated Remaining Time for Full Completion**: ~15-20 hours
- High-priority battleship guns: ~6 hours
