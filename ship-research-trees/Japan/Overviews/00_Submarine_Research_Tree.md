## Historical Context

### Early Development (1905-1920)
- Imported designs from USA, UK, France, Italy
- First domestic designs 1918-1920
- Limited WWI use

### Interwar Expansion (1920-1941)
- Rapid submarine development
- Focus on fleet submarines for Pacific operations
- Development of aircraft-carrying submarines
- Emphasis on long range and endurance

### WWII Era (1941-1945)
- Large submarine force at war start
- Initial successes against warships
- Shift to commerce warfare less successful than German U-boats
- Development of specialized types (I-400, I-201)
- Heavy losses 1943-1945 to ASW forces
- Desperate measures: midget submarines, Kaiten suicide torpedoes

## Notable Service

### Pearl Harbor (December 1941)
- **Type A Ko-hyōteki midget submarines:** 5 launched, all lost, minimal success
- Fleet submarines on patrol, limited success

### Early War Successes (1941-1942)
- **I-168:** Sank USS Yorktown at Midway (June 1942)
- **I-19:** Incredible single salvo (September 1942):
  - Sank carrier USS Wasp
  - Sank destroyer USS O'Brien
  - Damaged battleship USS North Carolina
- **I-26:** Sank cruiser USS Juneau (Sullivan brothers killed)

### Mid-War Operations (1942-1944)
- Guadalcanal campaign: supply runs, warship attacks
- Indian Ocean operations
- Midget submarine attacks on Sydney, Diego Suarez

### Late War (1944-1945)
- **I-58:** Sank USS Indianapolis (July 1945) - delivered atomic bomb components
- I-400-class prepared for Panama Canal strike (war ended before mission)
- Kaiten suicide torpedo attacks
- Heavy losses to US ASW forces
- Most submarines sunk or surrendered 1945

## Submarine Doctrine

Japanese submarine doctrine emphasized:
1. **Fleet Support:** Operate with surface fleet, attack enemy capital ships
2. **Reconnaissance:** Scout for fleet, use floatplanes for extended range
3. **Long Range:** Pacific distances required 60+ day endurance
4. **Attack Enemy Warships:** Priority on battleships and carriers over merchant ships
5. **Special Operations:** Midget submarines, supply runs, commando insertion

## Specialized Capabilities

### Aircraft-Carrying Submarines
- **Purpose:** Extended reconnaissance, surprise air attacks
- **Types:** I-9, I-13, I-15, I-25, I-400 classes
- **Aircraft:** Yokosuka E14Y "Glen" reconnaissance, Aichi M6A "Seiran" attack floatplane
- **Operations:** Reconnaissance missions, limited bombing attacks on US mainland

### Midget Submarines
- **Purpose:** Harbor penetration, surprise attacks on anchored ships
- **Operations:** Pearl Harbor (1941), Sydney Harbor (1942), Diego Suarez (1942)
- **Results:** Limited success, high casualties

### Kaiten Human Torpedoes
- **Purpose:** Suicide attacks on ships
- **Operations:** Desperation weapons 1944-1945
- **Results:** Sank ~2 ships, killed ~100+ pilots, minimal strategic impact
