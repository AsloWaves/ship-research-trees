**First 21-inch Torpedoes** - Major upgrade from 18-inch to 21-inch (533mm) Mark 8 torpedoes, significantly increasing striking power.

**Game Changers:**
- 🚀 **First 21-inch Torpedoes** - Mark 8, 533mm (vs 18-inch/450mm)
- 🔧 **Zoelly Turbines** - Direct-drive steam turbines
- ⚙️ **Cruising Engines** - Most had triple-expansion reciprocating engines for efficiency
- 📈 **+1,000 shp** - 17,000 shp vs 16,000 shp

**vs [[Aylwin-Class]]:** +14t | +1,000 shp | 18"→**21" torpedoes** | Zoelly turbines

**Notable:** USS Cushing had 2 geared steam turbines for cruising (experimental)

**WWI:** Depth charges added | No original AA guns
