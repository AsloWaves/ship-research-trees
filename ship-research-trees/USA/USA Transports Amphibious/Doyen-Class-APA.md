**First Dedicated APAs** - Doyen-class were first purpose-built attack transports for US Navy. 2 ships. Inspired by British "Glen" liner conversions with shallow draft for beach operations.

**Key Specs:** 4,351/6,710 tons | 415ft | 19 kn | 710 troops | 75,000 cuft cargo | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First attack transports designed from keel-up rather than converted from other hulls. Built on commercial standards with military features incorporated during construction. Unusually shallow 18.5-foot draft allowed closer beach approaches. Originally classified AP-2, reclassified APA-1 on February 1, 1943.

**Ships:**
- **USS Doyen (APA-1)** - Commissioned May 22, 1943, decommissioned 1946
- **USS Feland (APA-11)** - Commissioned May 22, 1943, decommissioned 1946

**Service:** Both ships commissioned May 1943 and served through Pacific War. Provided troop transport and amphibious assault capabilities for island-hopping campaign. Relatively small size (710 troops vs 1,500+ for later APAs) but proved concept of purpose-built attack transport.

**Design:** Westinghouse turbines provided 8,000 SHP for 19-knot speed. Four 3-inch/50 cal guns for fire support, supplemented by 40mm and 20mm AA weapons. Cargo capacity of 75,000 cubic feet. Carried LCVPs and LCMs for ship-to-shore movement. Both ships named after Marine Corps generals.

**Legacy:** Established template for attack transport design. Demonstrated value of purpose-built APAs versus conversions. Led directly to much larger Harris, Bayfield, and Haskell classes that formed backbone of WWII amphibious forces.
