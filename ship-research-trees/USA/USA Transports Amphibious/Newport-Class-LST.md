**Revolutionary Modern LST** - Newport-class were revolutionary non-beaching LSTs with derrick arm bow ramp, destroyer bow, and 20+ knot speed. 20 ships. Final and largest LST design, served 1969-2002.

**Key Specs:** 5,190/8,550 tons | 522ft | 20-22 kn | 431 troops | 500 tons vehicles | 20 ships

**Design:** Revolutionary departure from traditional LST concept. Destroyer-type sharp bow instead of blunt beaching bow. Distinctive 112-foot aluminum derrick arm bow ramp (34 tons, supports 75-ton loads) eliminated traditional bow doors. Ramp supported by two derrick arms extending beyond bow (total length over derrick arms: 562 ft). Hydraulic operation. Ships built at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (3 ships: LST-1179 to 1181) and National Steel and Shipbuilding San Diego (17 ships: LST-1182 to 1198).

**Propulsion:** First 3 ships (LST-1179-1181): 6× GM 16-645-ES diesels. Remaining 17 ships (LST-1182-1198): 6× ALCO 16-251 diesels. Configuration: 3 engines per shaft, 2 shafts. Total power: 16,500 BHP. Speed: 22 knots maximum (short period), 20 knots sustained, 14 knots cruising. Range: 2,500 nm at 14 knots. Fuel capacity: 1,750 long tons diesel.

**Landing System:** Bow ramp system eliminated traditional beach grounding. Ramp extends to shore from offshore position. Stern gate unloads amphibious vehicles into water or onto LCU/pier. Helicopter deck atop stern gate enables vertical assault capability. More conventional hull form optimized for speed over beaching. Cargo area: 19,000 sqft (1,800 m²) for tanks and vehicles. Vehicle weight capacity: 500 long tons (508 metric tons).

**Ships:** USS Newport (LST-1179), USS Manitowoc (LST-1180), USS Sumter (LST-1181), USS Fresno (LST-1182), USS Peoria (LST-1183), USS Frederick (LST-1184), USS Schenectady (LST-1185), USS Cayuga (LST-1186), USS Tuscaloosa (LST-1187), USS Saginaw (LST-1188), USS San Bernardino (LST-1189), USS Boulder (LST-1190), USS Racine (LST-1191), USS Spartanburg County (LST-1192), USS Fairfax County (LST-1193), USS La Moure County (LST-1194), USS Barbour County (LST-1195), USS Harlan County (LST-1196), USS Barnstable County (LST-1197), USS Bristol County (LST-1198). 27 ships originally planned, 20 built, 7 cancelled.

**Service:** Active 1969-2002. Vietnam War (final years), Cold War amphibious exercises, Persian Gulf operations, global deployments. First LSTs capable of keeping up with carrier battle groups (20+ knots). Declared obsolete 1987 after LCAC introduction but continued service for fuel transport capability (hundreds of thousands of gallons capacity critical for Marine Expeditionary Force logistics). Armament removed by 1994 for weight reduction.

**Foreign Transfers:** Mexico, Australia (operated as Kanimbla-class), Taiwan/ROC (modernization programs, some still in service 2020s), Spain (operated as Pizarro-class), Chile. Transfers began early 1990s, accelerated mid-1990s. Some ships still operational in foreign service 2020s. Extended service life beyond US Navy use.

**Legacy:** Final LST design represented revolutionary change from traditional beaching concept. 20+ knot speed enabled task force integration. Derrick arm ramp system provided flexibility. Stern gate and helicopter deck enhanced operational versatility. Largest LST ever built (522 ft, 8,550 tons). Changed LST operational doctrine from beach grounding to offshore ramp operations.
