**Light Carriers** - Independence-class were light carriers converted from Cleveland-class cruiser hulls. 9 ships built rapidly 1942-1943 to provide carriers quickly during WWII buildup.

**Key Specs:** 11,000/15,100 tons | 622ft | 31.5/32 kn | 30-45 aircraft | Converted cruiser hulls | 9 ships

**Innovation:** Emergency conversion of Cleveland-class cruiser hulls to light carriers (CVL). Retained cruiser machinery (100,000 shp, 32 knots). Fast construction - 11-15 months keel to commission. Smaller air groups but fast and available quickly.

**Design:** Cruiser hull with flight deck added. Fast (32 kn) but limited aircraft capacity. Narrow flight deck. Small hangar. Two elevators. No island on some. Rapid construction program.

**Ships:** Independence, Princeton (lost Leyte Gulf), Belleau Wood, Cowpens, Monterey (Gerald Ford served aboard), Langley, Cabot, Bataan, San Jacinto (George H.W. Bush flew from).

**Service:** Pacific War 1943-1945. Fast carrier task forces. Smaller air groups supplemented Essex-class. Battle of Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf. Several transferred to France, Spain postwar. Princeton sunk October 1944 by dive bomber.
