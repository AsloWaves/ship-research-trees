**First Purpose-Built** - Ranger (CV-4) was first US carrier designed and built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier (not a conversion). Commissioned 1934.

**Key Specs:** 14,500/17,577 tons | 769ft | 29.5 kn | 86 aircraft | 53,500 shp | First purpose-built carrier

**Innovation:** First US carrier built as carrier from start (not converted). Smaller than Lexington to maximize numbers under treaty limits. Flush deck, no island initially. Six internal catapults.

**Design:** Small displacement to maximize carrier numbers. No island superstructure initially (added 1942). Thin armor. Flush flight deck. Limited speed. Maximized air group size.
