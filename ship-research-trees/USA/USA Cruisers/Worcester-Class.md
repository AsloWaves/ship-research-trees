**Automatic 6-inch Gun Cruisers** - Worcester-class featured revolutionary automatic-loading 6-inch guns (150 rpm). Largest, most powerful light cruisers.

**Key Specs:** 14,700t | 680ft | 33kn | 12× 6"/47 Mark 16 auto guns | 2 ships (Worcester, Roanoke)

**Innovation:** 6-inch/47 Mark 16 automatic guns - 10 rounds/min/barrel (150 rpm total), vs 8-10 rpm manual

**Note:** Only 2 of 10 planned completed. Too expensive for post-war budget.
