**First All-Turbine Battleships** - Florida-class were first US battleships with turbine propulsion for both ships. 2 ships. Improved Delaware design with better machinery arrangement.

**Key Specs:** 21,825/23,033 tons | 522ft | 20.75 kn | 10× 12"/45 (5 twin turrets) | 11" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** First class where both ships used turbine propulsion. Florida and Utah improved on Delaware design with better internal arrangement and fire control systems. Four-shaft turbine arrangement provided better maneuverability than Delaware's two-shaft design.

**Ships:**
- **Florida (BB-30)** - Commissioned Sept 15, 1911, decommissioned Feb 15, 1931, scrapped 1932
- **Utah (BB-31)** - Commissioned Aug 31, 1911, converted to target ship 1931, sunk at Pearl Harbor Dec 7, 1941

**Service:** WWI convoy escort duties. Florida participated in occupation of Vera Cruz 1914. Utah converted to mobile target ship (AG-16) 1931, sunk during Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

**Design:** Final evolution of 10-gun dreadnought design before switch to 12-gun arrangement. Parsons turbines more reliable than North Dakota's experimental Curtis turbines. Mixed coal/oil firing with 1,825 tons coal and 400 tons oil capacity.

**Legacy:** Utah remains at Pearl Harbor as war grave. Bridge between Delaware and Wyoming classes. Demonstrated viability of all-turbine propulsion for US battleships.
