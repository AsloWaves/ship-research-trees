**Improved Design** - B-class submarines were larger with two torpedo tubes. 3 boats built by Fore River Shipbuilding.

**Key Specs:** 145/173 tons | 82ft | 9/8kn | 2× 18" torpedo tubes | Gasoline/electric | 3 boats (Viper, Cuttlefish, Tarantula)

**Design:** Significant size increase over A-class. Two torpedo tubes (major improvement). Better seakeeping for coastal operations.

**Service:** Training and patrol 1907-1922. All three decommissioned 1922.
