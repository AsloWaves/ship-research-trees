**Experimental Midget Submarine** - X-1 was smallest US Navy submarine. Midget submarine for research and harbor defense evaluation. Originally hydrogen peroxide powered, converted to diesel-electric after explosion. Evaluated offensive and defensive capabilities of midget submarines.

**Key Specs:** 31/36 tons | 49.5ft | 10-15 kn | 4 crew | Diesel-electric (originally H₂O₂) | No armament | EXPERIMENTAL

**Innovation:** First and only US Navy midget submarine. Tested hydrogen peroxide propulsion (Walter cycle). Evaluated midget submarine capabilities for harbor defense and attack. Helped develop defensive measures against small submarines.

**Design:**
- **Length:** 49.5 feet (15.1 m)
- **Beam:** 7 feet (2.1 m)
- **Displacement:** 31 tons surface / 36 tons submerged
- **Crew:** 4 (1 officer, 3 enlisted)
- **Speed:** 10-15 knots
- **Depth:** Limited (shallow water operations)

**Construction:**
- **Project:** SCB 65
- **Laid down:** June 8, 1954, Fairchild Engine & Airplane, Deer Park, NY
- **Launched:** September 7, 1955
- **In service:** October 7, 1955
- **Original cost:** Unknown
- **Purpose:** Research and evaluation

**Propulsion History:**
- **Original (1955-1957):** Hydrogen peroxide/diesel and battery system
- **May 20, 1957:** Hydrogen peroxide supply exploded
- **Post-1957:** Modified to diesel-electric drive
- **Reason:** Hydrogen peroxide too dangerous for operational use

**Walter Cycle (Original System):**
Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) propulsion provided:
- **High underwater speed:** 15 knots submerged
- **Air-independent:** No need to surface or snorkel
- **Quiet operation:** No noisy diesel exhaust
- **Limitation:** Hydrogen peroxide unstable and dangerous

**Research Mission:**
- **Harbor defense:** Evaluate ability to defend ports against midget subs
- **Offensive capability:** Determine attack potential of small submarines
- **Limitations:** Identify tactical and technical constraints
- **Countermeasures:** Develop defense against midget submarine threats
- **Crew training:** Train personnel in midget submarine operations

**Operational History (1955-1973):**
X-1 conducted extensive tests and evaluations of midget submarine capabilities. Served in research capacity testing:
- Detection systems for small submarines
- Tactics for harbor penetration
- Defensive sonar systems
- Small submarine handling characteristics

**Why Midget Submarines Were Studied:**
- **WWII experience:** Japanese, Italian, German midget subs in combat
- **Harbor attacks:** Pearl Harbor, Sydney, Madagascar
- **Cold War concern:** Soviet midget submarine development
- **US vulnerability:** Major ports potentially vulnerable to attack
- **Defensive need:** Develop countermeasures and detection

**Comparison to Foreign Midget Subs:**
| Feature | X-1 (US) | Seehund (German) | Kaiten (Japanese) | X-Craft (British) |
|---------|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Crew | 4 | 2 | 1 (suicide) | 4 |
| Length | 49.5 ft | 39 ft | 48 ft | 51 ft |
| Tonnage | 36 tons | 15 tons | 8 tons | 30 tons |
| Role | Research | Attack | Suicide | Attack |
| Armament | None | 2 torpedoes | 1 torpedo | 2 charges |

**Hydrogen Peroxide Explosion (1957):**
- **Date:** May 20, 1957
- **Location:** New London, CT
- **Cause:** Hydrogen peroxide instability
- **Result:** Explosion, no fatalities reported
- **Consequence:** X-1 converted to conventional diesel-electric
- **Impact:** US abandoned hydrogen peroxide submarine propulsion

**Post-Service:**
- **Decommissioned:** 1973
- **Stricken:** 1973
- **Fate:** Museum ship
- **Location:** Submarine Force Museum, Groton, Connecticut
- **Status:** On display since 2001

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Hydrogen peroxide:** Too dangerous for operational submarines
- **Midget submarines:** Limited operational value for US Navy
- **Harbor defense:** Improved detection systems developed
- **Size limitations:** Too small for US Navy operational needs
- **Defensive doctrine:** Better understanding of small submarine threats

**Why US Didn't Pursue Midget Submarines:**
1. **Size:** US Navy focused on large, long-range submarines
2. **Doctrine:** Blue-water navy, not coastal defense
3. **Technology:** Nuclear power made small subs unnecessary
4. **Tactics:** No strategic need for harbor penetration
5. **Alternatives:** Full-size submarines more versatile

**Impact:**
- **Harbor security:** Improved detection of small submarines
- **Sonar development:** Better systems for small target detection
- **Defensive measures:** Nets, sonar, patrols in sensitive harbors
- **Intelligence:** Understanding of Soviet midget submarine programs
- **Training:** ASW forces learned to detect small submarines

**Foreign Adoption:**
Many navies continued midget submarine development:
- **Soviet Union:** Multiple classes for Spetsnaz delivery
- **North Korea:** Large fleet of midget submarines
- **Italy:** Continued WWII midget submarine tradition
- **Iran:** Imported North Korean designs
- US Navy focused on full-size nuclear submarines instead

**Legacy:**
- Only US Navy midget submarine
- Demonstrated hydrogen peroxide propulsion risks
- Provided valuable data for harbor defense
- Helped develop ASW tactics against small submarines
- Now preserved as museum exhibit
