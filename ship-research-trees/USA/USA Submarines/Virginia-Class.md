**Current SSN Class** - Virginia-class are current US attack submarines. 24 built, 66 planned. More affordable than Seawolf while maintaining high capability.

**Key Specs:** 7800/10200 tons | 377ft (Block V: 460ft) | 25+/33+ kn | 4× 21" tubes + 12-40× VLS | S9G reactor (life-of-ship) | 24+ boats

**Innovation:** Life-of-ship reactor core (no refueling needed). Photonics masts replace periscopes. Block V adds Virginia Payload Module (VPM) with 28 additional Tomahawk tubes (40 total). Fly-by-wire joystick controls.

**Design Evolution:**
- Block I/II (SSN-774 to 783): Base design, 12 VLS
- Block III (SSN-784 to 791): Cost reduction, new bow
- Block IV (SSN-792 to 801): Further improvements
- Block V (SSN-802+): VPM module, 460ft long, 40 VLS

**Service:** Global operations 2004-present. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria operations. All 24 boats active. Production ongoing through 2040s.
