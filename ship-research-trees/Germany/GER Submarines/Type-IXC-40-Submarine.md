**Enhanced Type IX - 87 Boats! Most Numerous!** - 87 boats commissioned 1941-1944: U-167 to U-1235 series. **MOST NUMEROUS TYPE IX VARIANT!** Enhanced Type IXC. 1144 tons surfaced, **6× 53.3cm torpedo tubes**, **22 torpedoes carried**, 18.3 knots surfaced/7.3 knots submerged. **11,400 nm range** (enhanced 3.6% over IXC 11,000 nm!). **87 BOATS BUILT!** - most successful Type IX production run! **Together with IXC (54): 141 boats = 72% of 194 Type IX total!** Wartime mass production 1941-1944. Global operations standard. Late-war AA armament increased (1× 3.7cm + 4-6× 2cm Flak!). Final Type IX production variant before IXD ultra-long-range.

**Key Features:** 87 BOATS! (most Type IX!) | 11,400 nm range (enhanced!) | 1144 tons (refined) | 22 torpedoes (maximum) | Mass production 1941-1944 | IXC + IXC/40 = 141 boats! | 72% of Type IX total! | Global ops standard | Most successful production

**Ships:** 87 boats (U-167 to U-1235 series, commissioned 1941-1944, global long-range operations, heavy combat losses 1943-1945, few survivors)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1941-1945). WWII service (1941-1945): **MOST NUMEROUS TYPE IX VARIANT!** **87 boats built** 1941-1944 - exceeded Type IXC (54 boats) as largest Type IX production run. **Together IXC + IXC/40 = 141 boats** represented 72% of 194 Type IX total family! Type IXC/40 became standard long-range submarine 1942-1945 as Type VIIC dominated North Atlantic. **Enhanced design improvements**: 1144 tons surfaced (IXC: 1120 tons - 2% larger). Slightly longer (252.3 ft vs. 251.9 ft). Extra fuel tanks added for **11,400 nm range** (IXC: 11,000 nm - 3.6% improvement). Designation "C/40" refers to 1940 design modification (Mod 1940). Enhanced hull strengthening, improved crew quarters, better ventilation for tropical operations. **Extended range advantage**: 11,400 nm range enabled even deeper global penetration. Could reach: **Indian Ocean** (8,000 nm from France) operating from Penang, Malaysia base. **South Atlantic** (6,500 nm) hunting Cape Town-Brazil convoys. **Caribbean** (5,500 nm) targeting oil tankers. **US East/Gulf Coast** (5,000 nm) attacking coastal shipping. **West Africa** (4,500 nm) intercepting Freetown convoys. Could patrol 5-6 months without refueling. **Wartime mass production**: Peak Type IXC/40 production 1942-1943 as Germany maximized U-boat construction. Multiple shipyards building simultaneously. Average build time: 9-12 months (longer than Type VIIC 72 days due to larger size/complexity). But still impressive given wartime resource constraints and Allied bombing. **Global operations**: Type IXC/40 boats operated on all oceans and seas 1941-1945: **Indian Ocean operations**: Operated from Penang, Malaysia (Japanese-controlled). Attacked British convoys India-Middle East-East Africa routes. U-183 operated 2.5 years in Far East! U-532 operated Malacca Strait, Java Sea. **Caribbean/US operations**: Continued Operation Drumbeat missions. U-518 operated Caribbean 1942-1943. U-847 attacked Brazil coast. **South Atlantic**: Hunted Allied convoys between Cape Town and Brazil. U-848 operated off West Africa. U-172 patrolled South Atlantic. **AA armament escalation**: Early IXC/40 (1941-1942): 10.5cm deck gun + 1× 3.7cm + 1-2× 2cm Flak. Mid-war (1943): Deck gun often retained + 1× 3.7cm + 2-4× 2cm Flak. **Late-war (1944-1945): Deck gun REMOVED + 1× 3.7cm + 4-6× 2cm Flak!** Some boats fitted Flak Vierling (quad 2cm) + twin 2cm mounts. Reflected Allied air dominance - U-boats fought aircraft more than ships. Heavy AA turned Type IXC/40 into anti-aircraft platforms late-war. **Combat effectiveness**: Type IXC/40 achieved mixed results. Early boats (1941-1943) very successful in distant waters with weak defenses. Late boats (1944-1945) struggled as Allied ASW became global. Operated in safer distant waters longer than Type VII North Atlantic boats. Average Type IXC/40 sank 8-12 ships (40,000-80,000 tons) during service. **Combat losses**: Catastrophic losses 1943-1945 as Allied ASW extended worldwide. Approximately 73 of 87 Type IXC/40 lost (84% loss rate!). Depth charges, aircraft, destroyer escorts, submarines, mines. **U-848** sunk November 1943 (aircraft, South Atlantic - 5 aircraft destroyed attacking!). **U-534** sunk May 1945 (aircraft, Kattegat - last days of war!). **U-853** sunk May 1945 (destroyer, off Rhode Island - last U-boat sunk WWII Atlantic!). Only 14 Type IXC/40 survived war. **Famous boats**: **U-505** (Type IXC, not IXC/40, but operated alongside) - captured intact June 1944 by US Navy! Enigma machine and codebooks seized! Now Chicago Museum. **U-183** - operated Indian Ocean 2.5 years from Penang! Longest deployment! Sunk April 1945 (submarine, Java Sea). **U-532** - survived war, turned over to US Navy, tested then scuttled. **Historical significance**: Type IXC/40 represented **peak Type IX mass production**. 87 boats proved design viable for sustained wartime construction. Combined with Type IXC (54 boats), IXC/IXC/40 represented Germany's commitment to global submarine warfare. While Type VIIC fought North Atlantic (577-593 boats), Type IXC/40 hunted worldwide (87 boats). **Legacy**: Type IXC/40 established standard for long-range submarine operations. Post-WWII Soviet Union studied Type IX extensively. Foxtrot-class submarines (1958-1983, 75 built!) incorporated Type IX design features (long range, ocean-going, diesel-electric). US Navy Balao-class (1943-1945, 120 built!) designed to counter Type IX with similar size/range. Type IXC/40 influenced submarine design for decades.
