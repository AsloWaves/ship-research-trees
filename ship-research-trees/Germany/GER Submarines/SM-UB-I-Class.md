**First German Coastal Submarine - Confined Waters Operations** - 17 boats commissioned 1915: UB-1 to UB-17. **First German coastal submarine!** Designed for **confined waters** operations (Mediterranean, Baltic, Flanders coast). 127 tons surfaced (tiny!), **2× 45cm torpedo tubes**, 2 torpedoes carried, 6.5 knots surfaced/5.5 knots submerged. **Transportable by rail/canal** for deployment far from German shipyards. Gasoline propulsion (small engine), 1,650 nm range. Mediterranean operations, Baltic Sea, Flanders Flotilla. Small crew (14), simplified single hull construction.

**Key Features:** First coastal U-boat! | Tiny (127 tons!) | Confined waters | Transportable (rail/canal!) | Mediterranean/Baltic/Flanders | 2 torpedoes | 17 boats built | Gasoline propulsion | Small crew (14)

**Ships:** 17 boats (UB-1 to UB-17, commissioned 1915, WWI coastal operations, most lost in combat, survivors scrapped 1919)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1915-1919). WWI service (1915-1918): **Coastal submarine pioneer** - designed for operations in confined waters where large ocean-going U-boats couldn't operate effectively. **Transportable design**: UB-I class small enough to transport by rail and canal! Built in Germany, transported overland/canal to Mediterranean (UB-7 to UB-17), Baltic (UB-1 to UB-6), Flanders coast. Enabled rapid deployment to distant theaters without long voyage. **Mediterranean operations**: UB-7 to UB-17 deployed to Adriatic/Mediterranean targeting Allied shipping in confined waters (Otranto Straits, Aegean Sea, coastal areas). Too shallow for large U-boats. **Flanders Flotilla**: Some boats operated from Bruges/Zeebrugge attacking English Channel shipping. Short-range missions in shallow coastal waters. **Baltic Sea**: UB-1 to UB-6 operated against Russian Navy in confined Baltic waters. **Limitations**: Tiny size (127 tons) limited combat effectiveness - only 2 torpedoes, slow speed (6.5 knots), limited range (1,650 nm). Gasoline engines dangerous in enclosed hull. Small crew (14) struggled with long patrols. **Combat losses**: Most UB-I lost 1915-1918 (mines, depth charges, ramming). UB-3 sunk April 1915 (mine). UB-13 sunk April 1916 (depth charge). UB-10 survived war, scrapped 1919. **Historical significance**: Proved coastal submarine concept viable - specialized designs for specific theaters more effective than one-size-fits-all approach. **Transportability revolutionary**: Building submarines in Germany and transporting overland to distant theaters enabled rapid deployment without British naval interception. **Legacy**: UB-I experience influenced UB-II (doubled size, diesel), UB-III (advanced coastal), and WWII Type II coastal submarines. Demonstrated need for specialized coastal boats alongside ocean-going types.
