**1906 Type Large Torpedo Boats - Turbine-Powered** - 12 ships commissioned 1906-1907: S138-S149. First "Large Torpedo Boats" (1906 Type program) with turbine propulsion standard. 533 tons, 2× 5cm guns, 3× 45cm torpedoes, **30.5 knots** (significantly faster than predecessors). Steam turbines (8,400 SHP) provided higher speed and better reliability. Improved seakeeping for North Sea operations. 12 ships built (successful class). WWI North Sea and Baltic operations (1914-1918). Many survived WWI, scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles.

**Key Features:** 1906 Type program (first "Large Torpedo Boats") | Turbine propulsion standard (30.5 knots) | Improved seakeeping | 12 ships built | Many WWI survivors

**Ships:** 12 ships (S138-S149, commissioned 1906-1907, many WWI survivors, scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1906-1920). North Sea and Baltic operations, fleet screening, torpedo attacks. WWI service (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations, Jutland (31 May 1916 - several ships engaged), night surface actions. Faster and more seaworthy than earlier classes, better suited to North Sea combat. Several losses from mines, submarine attacks, surface engagements. Many survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles. Demonstrated effectiveness of turbine propulsion for torpedo boats, influencing all future German destroyer designs.
