**Improved Torpedo Boats with Early Turbines (FREE Starting Ship)** - 6 ships commissioned 1900-1901: G108-G113. Improved S90 design with higher speed and early turbine technology. 433 tons, 3× 5cm guns, 3× 45cm torpedoes, **29 knots** (+2 knots improvement). Pioneering early steam turbine technology (turbines rare in 1900). Larger hull for better seakeeping in North Sea. FREE starting ship for tutorial purposes. Served WWI North Sea operations. Germaniawerft design (G-series). Most scrapped 1916-1920 after obsolescence.

**Key Features:** Improved speed (29 knots, +2 knots vs. S90) | Early steam turbine technology (pioneering) | FREE starting ship | Better seakeeping | Germaniawerft design

**Ships:** 6 ships (G108-G113, commissioned 1900-1901, scrapped 1916-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1900-1920). North Sea and Baltic operations, fleet screening, coastal patrol. WWI service (1914-1918): North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations, limited frontline service due to age. Better seakeeping than S90-class allowed longer North Sea patrols. Early turbine technology provided lessons learned for later destroyer development. Most withdrawn from frontline service 1916-1917, used as training vessels. Scrapped 1916-1920. Demonstrated viability of turbine propulsion for small warships, influencing later destroyer designs.
