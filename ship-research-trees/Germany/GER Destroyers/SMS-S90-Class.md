**First Modern German Torpedo Boats (FREE Starting Ship)** - 12 ships commissioned 1898-1899: S90-S101. First modern torpedo boat class for Kaiserliche Marine. 388 tons, 3× 5cm guns, 3× 45cm torpedoes, 26.5 knots. Established torpedo boat template: small, fast, coal-fired, unarmored coastal attack vessels. Proven design served early 1900s and early WWI. FREE starting ship for tutorial purposes. Most scrapped 1914-1920 after obsolescence. Foundation for German torpedo warfare doctrine.

**Key Features:** First modern German torpedo boats | FREE starting ship | 12 ships built (proven design) | Established torpedo boat template | 26.5 knots, 3× 45cm torpedoes

**Ships:** 12 ships (S90-S101, commissioned 1898-1899, most scrapped 1914-1920 after obsolescence)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1898-1920). Coastal defense, fleet screening, North Sea/Baltic operations. Early WWI service (1914-1916): Obsolete by WWI standards, limited to coastal patrol, harbor defense. Most withdrawn from frontline service 1914-1915 due to age and limited seaworthiness. Some served as training vessels 1916-1920. Scrapped 1914-1920. Established German torpedo warfare doctrine: small, fast, unarmored vessels carrying powerful torpedo armament for attacks on capital ships. Foundation for later torpedo boat and destroyer development.
