**1912 Improved Design - Fastest Early Destroyers** - 6 ships commissioned 1912-1913: S31-S36. Improved 1912 design refining S-series lessons learned. 585 tons, 2× 8.8cm guns, 4× 50cm torpedoes, **33.5 knots** (fastest 1911/1912 Program ships). Best range of early destroyers (2,100 nm) for extended North Sea operations. Balanced size, speed, and maneuverability. 6 ships built (successful class). Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916). Last pre-V25 destroyer design. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920.

**Key Features:** Fastest early destroyers (33.5 knots) | Best range (2,100 nm) | Balanced design | Last pre-V25 class | Battle of Jutland | Served entire WWI

**Ships:** 6 ships (S31-S36, commissioned 1912-1913, Battle of Jutland participants, survivors scrapped 1919-1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1912-1920). High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, North Sea operations. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service entire war, High Seas Fleet screening, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - multiple ships engaged in night actions), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations. Excellent balance of speed, range, and maneuverability made them highly effective. Several losses during war. Survivors scrapped 1919-1920 under Treaty of Versailles. Represented culmination of 1911/1912 Program destroyer development before revolutionary V25-class mass production began.
