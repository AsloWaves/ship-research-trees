**Type 1934 Production Ships - Enhanced AA** - 2 ships commissioned 1938: **Z3 Max Schultz**, Z4 Richard Beitzen. Type 1934 production ships with slight improvements over Z1/Z2. 2,239 tons standard, **5× 12.7cm (127mm) guns**, **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 38.5 knots. **Enhanced AA armament** (8× 20mm vs. 6×), slightly better range (4,450 nm). **Named after naval heroes** (Max Schultz = German officer). Same Type 1934 stability problems (top-weight issues). WWII service (1939-1944): **Norway campaign** (Z3 lost First Battle of Narvik 1940), Atlantic operations, English Channel. **Both ships lost in combat** (Z3 1940, Z4 1944). Continued revolutionary Type 1934 program.

**Key Features:** Type 1934 production | Enhanced AA (8× 20mm) | Better range (4,450 nm) | 5× 127mm guns | 38.5 knots | Both lost WWII | Narvik participants | Stability problems

**Ships:** 2 ships (Z3 Max Schultz, Z4 Richard Beitzen, commissioned 1938, both lost WWII combat: Z3 1940 Narvik, Z4 1944 air attack)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1938-1944). WWII service (1939-1944): **First Battle of Narvik** (10 April 1940 - Z3 Max Schultz sunk by British destroyers HMS Bedouin and Punjabi, major loss for Kriegsmarine), Atlantic convoy operations, English Channel operations, North Sea patrols, mine-laying missions. Production ships incorporated minor improvements from Z1/Z2 experience: enhanced AA capability (8× 20mm), slightly better range. Still suffered Type 1934 stability problems from excessive top-weight. **Z3 Max Schultz** lost 1940 Narvik - one of 10 German destroyers lost in two Battles of Narvik (devastating blow to German destroyer force). Z4 Richard Beitzen survived until 1944 (sunk by air attack). Type 1934 production demonstrated revolutionary German destroyer capability but highlighted critical stability flaws that led to Type 1934A and Type 1936 improvements.
