# Armament (Defensive Focus)
main_guns: "8× 15cm SK C/28 guns" (reduced for armor weight!)
secondary_guns: "20× 10.5cm SK C/33 AA guns" (HEAVY AA!)
aa_armament: "40× 3.7cm SK C/30 + 60× 2cm Flak 38" (MAXIMUM AA!)
armor_belt: 100-150mm (HEAVY belt armor!)
armor_deck: 120mm flight deck armor (ARMORED DECK!)
hangar_armor: 80mm hangar deck armor (British-style!)

# Technology (British-Influenced)
flight_deck_design: HEAVY 120mm armored flight deck (British Illustrious-style!)
hangar_design: Fully armored enclosed hangar (80mm deck armor)
aircraft_handling: Armored elevators, protected aircraft operations
damage_control: Enhanced survivability, armored compartments
fire_control: Advanced fire control, protected fire directors
protection_philosophy: Survivability over aircraft capacity (British concept!)

# British Influence (HMS Illustrious-class Study)
illustrious_lessons: Armored flight deck survivability (Mediterranean combat!)
kamikaze_resistance: Heavy armor vs. kamikaze attacks (Pacific lessons)
bomb_resistance: 120mm deck resists 500kg bombs
trade_off: Aircraft capacity reduced (40 vs. 50) for +40% survivability!

# Design Philosophy
armor_priority: Maximum survivability (British approach)
german_engineering: Dual-purpose guns retained (8× 15cm)
aa_emphasis: MAXIMUM AA armament (20× 10.5cm + 100× light AA!)
operational_concept: Survive in high-threat environments

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Improved-Graf-Zeppelin-Carrier]]"
successor: "[[Plan-Z-Super-Carrier]]"
contemporary: British Implacable-class (1944), US Midway-class (1945)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - ARMORED DECK CARRIER! (British-influenced design!)
  - "British Influence" special ability (+40% survivability, UNIQUE!)
  - 120MM ARMORED FLIGHT DECK! (British Illustrious-style!)
  - 80mm hangar deck armor (fully armored hangar!)
  - 150mm belt armor (HEAVY protection!)
  - British armored carrier concept (HMS Illustrious lessons!)
  - Survivability over aircraft capacity (trade-off!)
  - 40 aircraft (reduced from 50 for armor weight)
  - MAXIMUM AA: 20× 10.5cm + 40× 3.7cm + 60× 2cm (100+ guns!)
  - Protected against 500kg bomb hits (armored deck!)
  - Kamikaze resistance (Pacific War lessons!)
  - German dual-purpose guns retained (8× 15cm)
  - Intelligence on HMS Illustrious Mediterranean performance
  - PAPER SHIP! (-25% reliability penalty, pure speculation)
  - Would have been most survivable German carrier design
  - Never built due to carrier program abandonment

**British-Style Armored Carrier - 1944 Paper Ship!** - 0 boats: **ARMORED DECK CARRIER** - **Theoretical carrier incorporating British armored flight deck concept!** Influenced by **HMS Illustrious-class** Mediterranean combat performance and Pacific kamikaze threats. **42,000 tons**, **32.5 kts** (reduced for armor weight), **40 aircraft** (reduced from 50 for armor trade-off!). **REVOLUTIONARY ARMOR**: **120mm armored flight deck** (British-style!), **80mm hangar deck**, **150mm belt armor** (HEAVY protection!). Resists 500kg bomb hits, kamikaze attacks. **Trade-off**: Survivability over aircraft capacity (+40% survivability!). **MAXIMUM AA armament**: 20× 10.5cm + 40× 3.7cm + 60× 2cm = **100+ AA guns!** Retained German dual-purpose design (8× 15cm guns, reduced from 16). **PAPER SHIP** - pure speculation based on intelligence about British armored carriers. Never built. Would have been Germany's most survivable carrier design!
