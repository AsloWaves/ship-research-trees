**Fast Light Cruiser Design** - 2 ships built (1914): Karlsruhe, Rostock. Enhanced Magdeburg design: faster (28.5 knots), waterline belt armor (60mm), increased torpedo armament (4× tubes vs. 2×). 4,820 tons, 12× 10.5cm SK L/45 guns. **SMS Karlsruhe**: Famous Caribbean raider (Aug-Nov 1914), sank 16 Allied merchant ships, lost to internal magazine explosion (4 Nov 1914, 263 killed, 146 survivors). **SMS Rostock**: High Seas Fleet flagship, sunk at Battle of Jutland after torpedo damage (1 Jun 1916, 14 killed, 559 survivors).

**Key Features:** 28.5 knots (fast) | Karlsruhe: Caribbean raider (16 ships sunk) | Karlsruhe: Magazine explosion (263 killed) | Rostock: Sunk at Jutland

**Ships:** SMS Karlsruhe (magazine explosion 4 Nov 1914, 263 killed, 146 survivors), SMS Rostock (torpedoed at Jutland, scuttled 1 Jun 1916, 14 killed, 559 survivors)

**Service:** WWI operations (1914-1916). Karlsruhe: Caribbean commerce raider (Aug-Nov 1914), sank 16 Allied merchant ships totaling 76,777 GRT, lost to internal magazine explosion (4 Nov 1914, 263 killed, 146 survivors, cause unknown). Rostock: High Seas Fleet 2nd Scouting Group flagship, Battle of Jutland (31 May-1 Jun 1916), torpedoed by British destroyer Acasta, scuttled by German destroyers after crew evacuation (1 Jun 1916, 14 killed, 559 survivors). Both ships demonstrated successful fast light cruiser design.
