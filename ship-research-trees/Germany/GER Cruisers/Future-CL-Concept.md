**Postwar Light Cruiser Concept (Paper Ship) - Never Built** - Theoretical postwar light cruiser design incorporating WWII lessons learned and advanced technology. 12,000 tons, **12× 15cm automatic rapid-fire guns (6× twin turrets)**, missile capability, 36 knots. Maximum range (12,000 nm at 20 knots), combined steam/diesel propulsion for efficiency, advanced radar and automated fire control. First German cruiser concept with automatic guns and guided missile capability. Design study only, speculative postwar evolution. Would have represented 1950s-1960s technology level: automated turrets, guided missiles (surface-to-air + anti-ship), advanced electronics, hybrid propulsion. Never formally proposed, remained theoretical "what-if" exploring postwar cruiser evolution.

**Key Features:** Postwar concept (1950s-1960s technology) | Automatic rapid-fire guns (12× 15cm) | Missile capability (SAMs + anti-ship) | Maximum range (12,000 nm)

**Ships:** None (design study only, speculative postwar evolution, never formally proposed)

**Service:** Never built. Theoretical design study exploring postwar light cruiser evolution incorporating WWII lessons learned and 1950s-1960s technology. Proposed automatic rapid-fire 15cm guns (6× twin turrets, fully automated loading, higher rate of fire), guided missile capability (surface-to-air missiles for fleet defense, anti-ship missiles for offensive capability), advanced radar and fire control (automated targeting, electronic warfare systems), combined steam/diesel propulsion (cruising diesels for 12,000 nm range, turbines for 36-knot sprint speed). Would have represented Germany's postwar cruiser philosophy: automation, long range, missile armament, multi-role capability. Never formally proposed, remained speculative "what-if" scenario exploring how German cruiser design might have evolved in peacetime with access to advanced technology. Similar to actual postwar cruisers: HMS Tiger, USS Des Moines (automatic guns), Soviet Sverdlov-class (conventional), missile cruisers of 1960s.
