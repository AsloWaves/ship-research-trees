# Innovation
firsts:
  - Improved armored cruiser design (smaller, faster than Fürst Bismarck)
  - First German cruiser to achieve 20 knots speed
  - Reduced main armament (2× 24cm vs. 4× 24cm) for higher speed
  - Enhanced secondary armament (10× 15cm guns)
  - Demonstrated trade-off: fewer heavy guns for higher speed and maneuverability
  - Last German armored cruiser with 24cm main guns (later classes used 21cm)

**Improved Armored Cruiser Design (Single Ship)** - Commissioned 1902, decommissioned 1920. Improved design: smaller (8,887 tons vs. 10,690), faster (20 knots vs. 18.5) than Fürst Bismarck. 2× 24cm + 10× 15cm guns. Demonstrated trade-off: reduced main armament (2× vs. 4× 24cm) for higher speed and better maneuverability. First German cruiser to achieve 20 knots. Last German armored cruiser with 24cm guns (later classes adopted 21cm standard). Survived WWI, scrapped 1920.

**Key Features:** First German cruiser to achieve 20 knots | Smaller, faster than Fürst Bismarck | 2× 24cm + 10× 15cm guns | Speed-over-firepower trade-off

**Ships:** SMS Prinz Heinrich (single ship)

**Service:** Overseas service (1902-1914): East Asia, Mediterranean. WWI: High Seas Fleet service, Baltic operations. No major combat. Survived WWI, used as training ship 1918-1920. Scrapped 1920. Validated speed-over-firepower philosophy, influenced subsequent armored cruiser designs.
