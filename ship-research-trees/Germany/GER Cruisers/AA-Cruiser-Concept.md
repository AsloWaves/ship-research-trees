  - No main gun armament (AA specialist)
  - Advanced radar fire control system
  - Designed for fleet air defense
  - Would have protected battleships/carriers from air attack
  - Design study only (never progressed beyond planning)
  - Reflected growing importance of air defense

**Dedicated Anti-Aircraft Cruiser (Paper Ship) - Never Built** - Theoretical AA cruiser design optimized for fleet air defense. 9,500 tons, **16× 10.5cm SK C/33 AA guns (8× twin mounts)**, 24× 3.7cm AA, 48× 2cm AA, 34 knots. No main gun armament (dedicated AA specialist), advanced radar fire control system. Designed to protect battleships and carriers from air attack, provide fleet air defense umbrella. Design study only, never formally proposed. Similar concept to USS Atlanta-class (AA cruiser). Would have addressed Kriegsmarine's critical weakness: inadequate fleet air defense. Reflected growing importance of air power in naval warfare.

**Key Features:** Dedicated AA specialist (16× 10.5cm + 24× 3.7cm + 48× 2cm) | No main guns (AA only) | Advanced radar fire control | Fleet air defense role

**Ships:** None (design study only, never formally proposed for construction)

**Service:** Never built. Theoretical design study examining dedicated anti-aircraft cruiser for fleet air defense. Proposed maximum AA firepower: 16× 10.5cm SK C/33 dual-purpose guns (8× twin mounts, radar-directed), 24× 3.7cm SK C/30 AA (12× twin mounts), 48× 2cm AA (24× twin mounts). Advanced radar fire control: multiple radar directors, automated fire control systems, centralized AA direction. Designed to screen battleships/carriers from air attack, provide fleet air defense umbrella, counter Allied air superiority. No main gun armament (specialized AA role). Would have addressed Kriegsmarine's critical weakness in fleet air defense. Never formally proposed, remained theoretical exercise. Similar concept to USS Atlanta-class, HMS Dido-class (dedicated AA cruisers). Reflected recognition that air power had become dominant threat to surface fleets.
