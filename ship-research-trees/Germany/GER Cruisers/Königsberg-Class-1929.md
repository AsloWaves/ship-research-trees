**First Modern German Light Cruisers** - 3 ships built (1929-1930): Königsberg, Karlsruhe, Köln. Revolutionary design: 9× 15cm guns in **3× triple turrets** (first triple turrets on German cruisers), 32.8 knots (fastest German light cruisers). 6,650 tons. Modern fire control, high-pressure oil boilers. **All three lost in WWII**: **Königsberg**: First German cruiser sunk WWII (10 Apr 1940, Bergen, bombed by Fleet Air Arm Skuas). **Karlsruhe**: Torpedoed by British submarine Truant (9 Apr 1940, Operation Weserübung, 40 killed). **Köln**: Sunk by US bombers (30 Mar 1945, Wilhelmshaven).

**Key Features:** First triple turrets (9× 15cm guns) | Fastest German light cruisers (32.8 knots) | All three sunk WWII | Königsberg: First cruiser lost WWII (10 Apr 1940)

**Ships:** Königsberg (bombed Bergen 10 Apr 1940, first German cruiser lost WWII), Karlsruhe (torpedoed by HMS Truant 9 Apr 1940, 40 killed, 87 wounded), Köln (bombed by USAAF 30 Mar 1945, capsized)

**Service:** WWII operations (1939-1945). Königsberg: Operation Weserübung (Norway invasion, Apr 1940), Bergen occupation, bombed by Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skuas (10 Apr 1940, 500-lb bombs, 15 hits, capsized, first German cruiser lost WWII, first ship sunk by dive bombing). Karlsruhe: Operation Weserübung (Kristiansand occupation), torpedoed by British submarine HMS Truant (9 Apr 1940, 2 torpedoes, 40 killed, 87 wounded, scuttled by German torpedo boat).
