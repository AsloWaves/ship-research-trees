shafts: 3
fuel_type: Diesel
range: 12000 nm at 19 knots (estimated)

# Armament (H-39 design)

secondary_guns: "12× 15cm (5.9-inch) SK C/28"

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Bismarck-Class]]"
successor: None (never built, last German battleship design)
contemporary: "[[USS Iowa]]"

# Innovation
firsts:
  - Plan Z centerpiece (6× H-39 battleships, 1945-1948 completion projected)
  - H-39: 2 keels laid (Jul-Sep 1939), scrapped Nov 1941 (zero operational value)
  - H-44: Largest battleship ever designed (139,272 tons, 8× 50.8cm/20-inch guns)
  - Design escalation absurdity (H-39 → H-41 → H-42 → H-43 → H-44)
  - 300-500 million RM wasted (could have built 300-500 U-boats)
  - Strategic delusion (Plan Z approved 18 Jan 1939, war started 1 Sep 1939 = 7.5 months!)

**Nazi Germany's Ultimate Battleship Fantasy** - Plan Z's centerpiece (approved 18 Jan 1939, war started 1 Sep 1939 = 7.5 months later!). H-39: 56,444 tons, 8× 40.6cm (16-inch) guns, 12,000 nm range (diesel). 2 keels laid (Jul-Sep 1939), construction halted immediately (30 Sep 1939, U-boat priority), scrapped Nov 1941. Design escalation: H-39 (56,444 tons) → H-41 (74,799 tons, 42cm guns) → H-42 (96,555 tons, 48cm guns) → H-43 (111,000 tons) → **H-44** (139,272 tons, 8× 50.8cm/20-inch guns, largest battleship ever designed). 300-500 million RM wasted (could have built 300-500 U-boats). Strategic delusion: Projected 1945-1948 completion, war decided before ships operational. Zero ships launched, zero operational value.

**Key Features:** H-44 largest battleship designed (139,272 tons, 20-inch guns) | Plan Z strategic waste | 2 keels scrapped 1941 | 300-500 million RM wasted

**Ships:** "H" (keel laid 15 Jul 1939), "J" (keel laid 1 Sep 1939), "K"/"L"/"M"/"N" (contracts canceled, never laid down)

**Service:** None—2 keels laid (Jul-Sep 1939), construction halted 30 Sep 1939 (U-boat priority), keels scrapped Nov 1941. Plan Z approved 18 Jan 1939, war started 1 Sep 1939 (7.5 months!). Resources wasted: 300-500 million RM could have built 300-500 Type VII U-boats (14.5 million GRT sunk 1939-1945 vs. H-class: 0 GRT).
