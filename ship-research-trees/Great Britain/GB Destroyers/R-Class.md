# Admiralty R-Class Destroyers (1916)

## Overview
The Admiralty R-class were improved M-class destroyers, with 62 ships built 1916-1917 (51 completed before war's end). They featured slightly improved armament and enhanced anti-submarine capability. The class represented incremental refinement of the successful M-class design for continued mass production.

## Design

**Improvements Over M-Class:**
- Slightly larger (1,036 vs 994 tons)
- Higher power (27,000 vs 25,000 shp)
- Better range (3,450 vs 2,530 nm)
- Enhanced ASW capability

**Key Features:**
- Depth charge capability added
- Improved seaworthiness
- Higher speed (36 knots)
- Better endurance

**Design Philosophy:**
- M-class refinement
- Continued standardization
- Enhanced capability
- Mass production focus

## Production

**Wartime Completion:**
- 51 ships completed before Armistice
- 11 completed 1919-1920
- Multiple builders
- Rapid construction

**Builder Distribution:**
- Yarrow, Thornycroft, Denny
- Hawthorn Leslie, Swan Hunter
- Fairfield, Beardmore
- Other major yards

## Service History

**WWI Operations:**
- Grand Fleet service
- North Sea patrols
- Convoy escort
- Anti-submarine warfare

**Major Operations:**
- Late-war North Sea actions
- Convoy protection
- U-boat hunting
- Mine warfare

**Notable Ships:**
- HMS Rosalind - Extensive service
