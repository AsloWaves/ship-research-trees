# Type 42 Destroyers (1971-1985)

## Overview
The Type 42 destroyers were the Royal Navy's primary air defense destroyers from the 1970s-2000s, with 14 ships built 1971-1985 in three batches. Designed around the Sea Dart SAM system, they served extensively during the Cold War, Falklands War (1982), and Gulf conflicts. The class suffered notable losses in the Falklands but proved the value of area air defense, serving until the 2010s.

## Design Evolution

**Batch 1 (6 ships, 1975-1979):**
- 3,500 tons, 410 ft
- Original Sea Dart system
- Twin-arm launcher
- Shorter hull (stability issues)

**Batch 2 (4 ships, 1979-1982):**
- Similar to Batch 1
- Improved electronics
- Enhanced communications
- Built for export (Argentina order cancelled)

**Batch 3 (4 ships, 1982-1985):**
- 4,775 tons, 436 ft (26 ft longer)
- Improved seaworthiness
- Better stability
- Enhanced electronics
- Post-Falklands improvements

## Ships by Batch

**Batch 1 (1975-1979):**
1. HMS Sheffield (D80) - Lost Falklands 1982
2. HMS Birmingham (D86)
3. HMS Newcastle (D87)
4. HMS Glasgow (D88) - Damaged Falklands
5. HMS Cardiff (D108)
6. HMS Coventry (D118) - Lost Falklands 1982

**Batch 2 (1979-1982):**
7. HMS Exeter (D89)
8. HMS Southampton (D90)
9. HMS Nottingham (D91)
10. HMS Liverpool (D92)

**Batch 3 (1982-1985):**
11. HMS Manchester (D95)
12. HMS Gloucester (D96)
13. HMS Edinburgh (D97)
14. HMS York (D98)

## Falklands War (1982)

**Ships Present:**
- HMS Sheffield - Sunk by Exocet, May 4, 1982 (20 killed)
- HMS Coventry - Sunk by bombs, May 25, 1982 (19 killed)
- HMS Glasgow - Damaged by bomb (unexploded), survived
- HMS Cardiff - Successful Sea Dart engagements
- HMS Exeter - Sea Dart kills

**Combat Performance:**
- Sea Dart successful (several aircraft kills)
- Exocet vulnerability exposed (Sheffield)
- Close-in defense inadequate
- Type 965 radar limitations
- Aluminum superstructure fire risk

**Lessons Learned:**
- Need for close-in weapons (Phalanx added)
- Better damage control needed
- Improved radar systems required
- Longer hull necessary (Batch 3)
- Aluminum construction risk

## Service History

**Cold War (1975-1991):**
- NATO operations
- Mediterranean deployments
- Atlantic patrols
- Armilla Patrol (Gulf)
- Flag showing duties

**Gulf War (1991):**
- HMS Cardiff, Gloucester, Exeter
- Sea Dart air defense
- Mine countermeasures
- Effective combat performance

**Post-Cold War:**
- Balkans operations
- Iraq patrols
- Anti-piracy operations
- Training duties
- UN operations

## Modernization

**Post-Falklands Upgrades:**
- Phalanx CIWS added
- Type 996 radar (later ships)
- Enhanced communications
- Improved damage control
- Better fire suppression

**1990s Updates:**
- Electronics modernization
- Exocet SSM removed (some)
- Radar upgrades
- ASW improvements
- Command systems

## Decommissioning

**2000s-2010s Retirement:**
- First decommissioned 1999
- Last (HMS Edinburgh) 2013
- Replaced by Type 45 destroyers
- 25-38 year service lives

**Final Fates:**
- All scrapped or expended as targets
- None preserved initially
- HMS Edinburgh became museum ship (temporary)
- Long service lives overall

## Export Variants

**Argentina:**
- ARA Hércules (D1) - Batch 2, ex-HMS Sheffield (cancelled order)
- ARA Santísima Trinidad (D2) - Batch 2

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Effective area air defense
- Falklands exposed weaknesses
- Long service lives
- Cost-effective design

**Historical Significance:**
- Falklands War crucial
- Sheffield loss shocked nation
- Proved Sea Dart effectiveness
- Last RN destroyers with single gun

**Operational Impact:**
- Effective Cold War deterrent
- Gulf War proven
- Falklands lessons applied
- Influenced Type 45 design

**Falklands Impact:**
- HMS Sheffield loss - May 4, 1982 (first RN loss since WWII)
- HMS Coventry loss - May 25, 1982
- Revolutionized naval warfare thinking
- Led to improved defensive systems
