# Queen Elizabeth-Class Aircraft Carriers (2017)

## Overview
The Queen Elizabeth-class are the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy and the most powerful surface combatants in British history. Two 65,000-ton supercarriers featuring ski-jump ramps for F-35B Lightning II operations, they represent Britain's return to full carrier capability after decades of smaller V/STOL carriers. HMS Queen Elizabeth commissioned 2017, HMS Prince of Wales 2019. Both operate globally as flagships of British power projection.

## Global Significance

**Largest RN Warships Ever:**
- 65,000 tons (larger than WWII carriers)
- Nearly as large as US Navy supercarriers
- Only UK carriers since Ark Royal (1979)

**Power Projection:**
- First true British carriers since 1970s
- Return to "blue water" carrier capability
- Symbol of post-Brexit "Global Britain"
- NATO's second-most capable carriers (after US)

**Comparison to Predecessors:**
- Invincible-class (1980-2014): 20,000 tons, Harriers
- Queen Elizabeth-class: 65,000 tons, F-35Bs
- **3× larger, far more capable**

## Cost and Controversy

**Total Programme Cost:**
- £6.2 billion for both ships
- £3.1 billion each
- Most expensive UK defense project

**Controversies:**
- No catapults (CATOBAR vs STOBAR debate)
- Limited to F-35B (cannot operate conventional aircraft)
- High operating costs
- Crew shortages
- Mechanical issues (Prince of Wales propeller shaft)

**Defenders:**
- Provide credible power projection
- Interoperable with US Navy (F-35B commonality)
- Largest RN warships ever
- Essential for global operations

## Comparison to Contemporary Carriers

| Carrier | Nation | Year | Displacement | Aircraft | Type |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Queen Elizabeth** | UK | 2017 | 65,000 tons | 40 (72 max) | STOBAR (ski-jump) |
| Gerald R. Ford | USA | 2017 | 100,000 tons | 75+ | CATOBAR (catapult) |
| Charles de Gaulle | France | 2001 | 42,000 tons | 40 | CATOBAR (nuclear) |
| Liaoning | China | 2012 | 60,000 tons | 40 | STOBAR (ski-jump) |
| Vikrant | India | 2022 | 45,000 tons | 30 | STOBAR (ski-jump) |

**Analysis:** Queen Elizabeth-class are second only to US supercarriers in Western world.

## Future Plans

**2025-2030:**
- Both ships fully operational
- Increased F-35B numbers (goal: 48 UK F-35Bs)
- NATO carrier strike groups
- Global deployments
- Continuous carrier availability (one always ready)

**Planned Upgrades:**
- Sea Ceptor missile defense
- Enhanced radar systems
- Improved electronic warfare
- F-35B Block 4 upgrades

**Service Life:**
- Designed for 50-year lifespan
- Expected service until 2060s-2070s
- Likely to receive mid-life refits

## Conclusions

The Queen Elizabeth-class carriers represent Britain's return to supercarrier operations after decades of smaller vessels. At 65,000 tons, they are the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy and demonstrate British commitment to global power projection in the 21st century.

**Key Points:**
1. **Largest RN warships ever** (65,000 tons)
2. **F-35B Lightning II** operations (stealth fighters)
3. **Ski-jump STOBAR** design (no catapults)
4. **Twin island** configuration (unique)
5. **Global deployments** (Indo-Pacific 2021)
6. **NATO flagship** capability
7. **50-year service life** (2017-2060s+)

These carriers symbolize "Global Britain" and provide the UK with power projection capability matched only by the United States. They ensure the Royal Navy remains one of the world's premier naval forces.
