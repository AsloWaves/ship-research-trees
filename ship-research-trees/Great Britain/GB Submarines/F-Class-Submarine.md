# F-Class Submarines (1913-1916)

## Overview
The F-class were coastal submarines with 3 boats built 1913-1916. They were designed as improved C-class coastal boats but incorporated diesel propulsion, representing a diesel-powered coastal design parallel to the fleet E-class. All three saw WWI service with one loss.

## Design

**Diesel Coastal Type:**
- Improved C-class with diesel power
- Smaller than E-class (coastal vs fleet)
- Good range for size (3,000 nm)
- Simple and reliable
- Limited production

**Key Features:**
- Diesel-electric propulsion
- Three torpedo tubes
- No deck gun
- Coastal defense role
- Economical design

## Boats

1. **F1** - 1915
2. **F2** - 1916
3. **F3** - 1916, lost 1916

## WWI Service

**Operations:**
- North Sea patrols
- Coastal defense
- Anti-U-boat operations
- Limited offensive operations
- Home waters only

## Loss

**Single Loss: F3 (1916):**
- Collision in North Sea, 1916
- All crew lost
- 33% loss rate

## Fate

**Survivors:**
- F1, F2 scrapped 1920
- Short operational lives
- Replaced by modern types
- Limited wartime impact

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Small class (3 boats)
- Diesel coastal design proven
- Overtaken by larger types
- Limited production run

**Historical Significance:**
- Diesel coastal submarine
- Parallel to E-class development
- Limited impact
- Design not repeated
