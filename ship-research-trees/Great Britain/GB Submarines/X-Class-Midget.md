# X-Class Midget Submarines (1942-1945)

## Overview
The X-Class were British midget submarines developed 1942-1945 for special operations against heavily defended enemy warships and coastal targets. Operating with a crew of four and displacing only 30 tons submerged, these tiny submarines achieved remarkable success, most notably crippling the German battleship Tirpitz in Operation Source (September 1943). Twelve operational X-craft (X5-X10, X20-X25) served in WWII, conducting attacks, reconnaissance, and beach survey missions. They represented peak British ingenuity in special operations warfare.

## Design and Development

### Origins (1942)

**Concept Genesis:**
- Response to Italian "human torpedo" attacks (Alexandria 1941)
- Need for attacks on heavily defended ships in harbors
- Conventional submarines too large for fjords and anchorages
- Special operations capability against high-value targets

**Design Philosophy:**
- Minimum size compatible with crew survival
- Detachable explosive charges (not suicide mission)
- Diesel-electric for endurance and stealth
- Towed to operational area by conventional submarine
- Four-man crew for watch-keeping and operations

### Technical Design

**Hull Design:**
- Riveted mild steel construction
- 51 feet long, 5.75 feet beam (very cramped)
- Wet-and-dry chamber for diver egress
- Periscope, compass, depth gauge
- Minimal internal space (four men lying down)

**Propulsion:**
- Gardner 4LK diesel engine (42 bhp)
- Electric motor (30 hp) for submerged operations
- Single propeller shaft
- Speed slow but adequate for mission
- Endurance limited by air quality and crew fatigue

**Weapons:**
- 2× detachable side charges (2 tons amatol each)
- Released under target via quick-release mechanism
- Time-delay fuses (up to 6 hours)
- Alternative: Diver-placed limpet mines
- No torpedoes (too large for craft size)

**Habitability:**
- Four men in 51-foot hull (extreme discomfort)
- No galley, minimal toilet facilities
- Sleeping in shifts (two on watch, two resting)
- CO2 absorption limited (mission endurance critical)
- Crew had to be specially selected for psychological resilience

## Operational History

### Operation Source (September 1943) - Attack on Tirpitz

**The Mission:**
- **Target**: German battleship Tirpitz in Kåfjord, Norway
- **Date**: 22 September 1943
- **X-Craft Deployed**: X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, X10
- **Method**: Towed 1,000 miles by conventional submarines, final approach independent

**The Attack:**
- **X5** (Lt. Henty-Creer): Lost with all hands, fate unknown
- **X6** (Lt. Cameron): Placed charges under Tirpitz, crew captured, survived
- **X7** (Lt. Place): Placed charges under Tirpitz, crew captured, three survived
- **X8** (Lt. McFarlane): Mechanical problems, scuttled, crew rescued
- **X9**: Lost under tow, cause unknown
- **X10** (Lt. Hudspeth): Periscope damaged, aborted mission, returned

**Results:**
- Tirpitz crippled by explosions from X6 and X7 charges
- Out of action for 6 months (repairs never fully completed)
- Lt. Donald Cameron and Lt. Basil Place: Victoria Cross
- Strategic success: Tirpitz never operational threat again

### Other Operations

**Operation Guidance (April 1944):**
- Beach reconnaissance for D-Day landings
- X-craft surveyed Normandy beaches
- Acted as navigation markers on D-Day (6 June 1944)
- Critical intelligence for amphibious landings
