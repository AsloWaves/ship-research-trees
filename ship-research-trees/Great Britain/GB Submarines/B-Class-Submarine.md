# B-Class Submarines (1904-1906)

## Overview
The B-class were improved A-class submarines, with 11 boats built 1904-1906. They featured modest improvements in speed, range, and habitability while retaining the petrol-electric propulsion system. They represented incremental development before the transition to diesel propulsion with the D-class.

## Design

**Incremental Improvements:**
- 50% larger than A-class
- Significantly better range (1,000 vs 320 nm)
- Higher speed (12 vs 10 knots)
- Better crew accommodation
- Improved seakeeping

**Key Features:**
- Longer hull for more fuel
- Enhanced diving capabilities
- Better surface performance
- Still petrol-electric (hazardous)

## Service History

**Pre-WWI (1905-1914):**
- Training and exercises
- Tactical development
- Home waters operations
- Fleet exercises
- Improved reliability

**WWI Service (1914-1918):**
- Coastal defense patrols
- Mediterranean deployment (B6, B9, B10, B11)
- Dardanelles operations
- Adriatic patrols
- Limited offensive success

**Notable Actions:**
- B11 - Torpedoed Turkish battleship Messudieh, Dardanelles, December 1914
- Mediterranean operations
- Adriatic Sea patrols

## Losses

**Operational Losses (3 of 11, 27%):**
- **B2** - Collision with SS Amerika, 1912 (15 killed)
- **B6** - Collision with steamer, Adriatic, 1918
- **B9** - Lost after collision, 1916
- **B10** - Collision with Italian steamer, 1916

**Lower Loss Rate:**
- Better than A-class (27% vs 38%)
- Still hazardous operations
- Improved safety features

## Operational Achievements

**B11 - Dardanelles Hero:**
- Penetrated minefields, December 13, 1914
- Torpedoed battleship Messudieh
- First submarine to sink warship with torpedo
- Lt. Norman Holbrook awarded Victoria Cross
- Legendary achievement

## Fate

**Scrapped 1919-1921:**
- Obsolete by war's end
- Replaced by modern types
- Some had 15-year service lives
- Mediterranean veterans

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Last major petrol-electric development
- Significantly improved capabilities
- Proven in combat (B11)
- Transition design

**Historical Significance:**
- B11's Dardanelles success legendary
- First submarine VC
- Proved submarine combat potential
- Mediterranean operations pioneering

**Operational Impact:**
- Demonstrated submarine effectiveness
- Mediterranean experience valuable
- Combat proven
- Led to D-class diesel development
