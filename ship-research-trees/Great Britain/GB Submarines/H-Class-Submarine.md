# H-Class Submarines (1915-1920)

## Overview
The H-class were mass-produced coastal submarines with 44 boats built 1915-1920. Designed for rapid wartime production, many were built in the United States and Canada before being shipped to Britain. The class represented economical, effective coastal defense submarines that saw limited WWI service but extensive post-war use with foreign navies.

## Design

**Rapid Production Design:**
- Based on American Electric Boat Company design
- Simple construction
- Proven components
- Mass production capable
- Coastal defense role

**Key Features:**
- Four bow torpedo tubes
- 21-inch torpedoes
- Good submerged speed (10 knots)
- Reliable diesel-electric
- No deck gun initially

**Production Groups:**
- **H1-H20:** Built in USA, shipped to UK
- **H21-H32:** Built in Canada, shipped to UK
- **H33-H44:** Built in UK (Vickers)
- **H45-H51:** Cancelled 1919

## Boats by Groups

**American-Built (H1-H20):**
- Fore River Shipbuilding (H1-H10)
- Union Iron Works (H11-H20)
- Shipped disassembled
- Reassembled in UK

**Canadian-Built (H21-H32):**
- Canadian Vickers, Montreal
- 12 boats
- Shipped to UK

**British-Built (H33-H44):**
- Vickers, Barrow
- 12 boats
- Late production

## WWI Service

**Limited War Service:**
- Most commissioned 1918-1920 (post-armistice)
- Late arrivals from USA/Canada
- Coastal defense patrols
- Training duties
- Limited combat

**Operational Use:**
- North Sea patrols
- Defensive operations
- Anti-submarine training
- Home waters only

## Losses

**Single WWI Loss:**
- **H6** - Collision with British steamer, 1918

**Post-WWI Losses:**
- **H42** - Collision, 1922
- Low loss rate overall (2 of 44, 4.5%)

## Post-WWI Service

**Extensive Foreign Sales:**
- Chile (H1-H6): Renamed, long service
- Canada (H1-H2 returned): HMCS CH-14, CH-15
- Netherlands (H1-H4): Retired 1930s
- Several others transferred

**Royal Navy:**
- Most scrapped 1920s-1930s
- Some continued training duties
- Economical to operate
- Replaced by new designs

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful mass production
- Reliable coastal submarine
- Economical design
- Excellent foreign service

**Historical Significance:**
- Largest production WWI coastal class (44 boats)
- International production (USA, Canada, UK)
- Extensive foreign service
- Mass production model

**Operational Impact:**
- Limited WWI impact (late arrival)
- Post-war value significant
- Foreign sales successful
- Economical coastal defense
