# Dreadnought-Class Nuclear Ballistic Submarines (Future Program)

## Overview
The Dreadnought-class are next-generation nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with 4 boats under construction to replace the Vanguard-class. Armed with Trident II D5 missiles and featuring the new PWR3 reactor and advanced stealth technology, they will maintain Britain's continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent from the 2030s through the 2060s and beyond.
