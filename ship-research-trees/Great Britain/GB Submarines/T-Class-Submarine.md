# T-Class Submarines (1938)

## Overview
The T-class were the Royal Navy's standard ocean-going patrol submarines of WWII, with 53 built between 1937-1945. Designed for Far East operations, they served in every theater from the North Sea to the Pacific. They were the most successful British submarine class, with excellent range, reliability, and combat effectiveness. About 25% were lost in combat, but survivors had distinguished records. Post-war, many were converted to anti-submarine vessels.

## Design Features

**Ocean Patrol Submarine:**
- Designed for Far East operations
- Long range (originally 8,000 nm, increased to 11,000 nm)
- Good seakeeping
- Reliable diesel engines

**Heavy Torpedo Armament:**
- 11 torpedo tubes (most of any British submarine)
- 8 internal bow tubes
- 2 external bow tubes
- 1 external stern tube
- Could fire devastating 8-torpedo salvo

**Variants:**
- **Group 1 (1937-1941):** Original design, 22 boats
- **Group 2 (1940-1942):** Modified, 7 boats
- **Group 3 (1941-1945):** Simplified wartime, 24 boats

## WWII Service

### North Sea & Arctic (1940-1945)

- Patrol operations off Norway
- Attacked German shipping
- Supported Allied convoys
- Harsh operating conditions

### Mediterranean (1940-1943)

**Most Intensive Operations:**
- Malta-based submarines
- Attacked Axis convoys to North Africa
- Heavy losses but critical disruption
- Several T-class sunk by depth charges, mines

### Far East & Pacific (1943-1945)

**Original Design Purpose:**
- Operated from Ceylon (Sri Lanka)
- Attacked Japanese shipping
- Long-range patrols

**Notable Victories:**
- **HMS Tigris sank Japanese heavy cruiser Ashigara (1945)** - One of largest enemy warships sunk by British submarine

### Notable Ships

**HMS Triton (N15):**
- First of class (commissioned 1938)
- **Sank German submarine U-5 (1940)** - First British submarine to sink enemy submarine in WWII
- Lost 1940 (friendly fire by HMS Oxley)

**HMS Tigris (N63):**
- **Sank Japanese cruiser Ashigara (8 June 1945)**
- 15,700-ton heavy cruiser
- Most significant T-class kill

**HMS Torbay:**
- One of most successful British submarines
- Mediterranean operations
- Multiple merchant and warship sinks

## Losses

**Combat Losses:**
- ~13 of 53 lost (about 25%)
- Mines, depth charges, aircraft
- Acceptable loss rate for intensive operations

**Causes:**
- Mines (Mediterranean, North Sea)
- Depth charges (convoy escorts)
- Aircraft (increasing threat)
- Friendly fire (HMS Triton)

## Post-War

**Anti-Submarine Conversion (1948-1955):**
- Oldest boats scrapped
- Remainder converted to anti-submarine training vessels
- Counter Soviet submarine threat
- New designation: T(A/S)

**Streamlining:**
- Removed deck gun
- Improved sonar
- Better underwater performance
- Training role

**Service Life:**
- Last T-class scrapped 1970s
- 30+ year service for some boats
- Excellent design longevity

## Legacy

**Most Successful British WWII Submarine:**
- 53 boats built
- Served all theaters
- Heavy torpedo armament
- Good reliability

**Combat Record:**
- Sank numerous Axis merchantmen
- Sank warships (cruiser Ashigara)
- First enemy submarine kill (U-5)
- ~25% loss rate (acceptable)

**Design Influence:**
- Established ocean patrol submarine design
- Influenced post-war A-class
- Standard for British submarines until nuclear age
