# Lion-Class Battleships (1939) - Cancelled

## Overview
The 1939 Lion-class were Britain's most advanced battleship design of WWII, intended as 16-inch gun super-battleships to counter Japanese Yamato and American Iowa classes. Six ships planned (Lion, Temeraire, Conqueror, Thunderer, and two unnamed) with two actually laid down in 1939. Construction suspended after WWII outbreak, briefly resumed 1939-1940, then permanently cancelled May 1940. Design revised 1942-1943 incorporating war lessons but scrapped on slipways in 1942. Would have been most powerful British battleships ever built.

## Design Development

**Response to Foreign Threats (1936-1938):**
- Japanese Yamato-class (18-inch guns, 70,000+ tons)
- American Iowa-class (9× 16-inch guns, 33 knots)
- British needed to counter these super-battleships
- King George V-class limited by treaty (14-inch guns)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Enlarged and improved King George V-class
- **9× 16-inch guns** (vs 10× 14-inch on KGV)
- 30-knot speed (same as KGV)
- Improved armor protection
- Better underwater protection
- ~40,000-ton standard displacement

**Three Triple Turrets:**
- "A"-"B"-"Y" arrangement (2 forward, 1 aft)
- 16-inch/45 cal Mk II guns
- Same guns designed for G3 battlecruisers (1921)
- Guns and turrets already in production when war started
- Shell weight: 2,375 lbs
- Range: 38,000 yards at 45° elevation

## Six Ships Planned

### Naval Programmes:

**1938 Programme:**
1. **HMS Lion** - Ordered 28 February 1939, laid down 4 July 1939 (Vickers-Armstrong, Walker)
2. **HMS Temeraire** - Ordered 28 February 1939, laid down 1 June 1939 (Cammell Laird, Birkenhead)

**1939 Programme:**
3. **HMS Conqueror** - Ordered 15 August 1939 (possibly), never laid down (John Brown, Clydebank)
4. **HMS Thunderer** - Scheduled for order 15 November 1939, never ordered (Fairfield, Govan)

**1940 Programme:**
5. **Unnamed** - Planned, never ordered
6. **Unnamed** - Planned, never ordered

## Construction History

### July-September 1939: Initial Construction
- **HMS Lion** laid down 4 July 1939 at Vickers, Walker
- **HMS Temeraire** laid down 1 June 1939 at Cammell Laird, Birkenhead
- Work proceeded slowly
- Material arriving at yards
- Early construction of hull plates and frames

### September-October 1939: First Suspension
- **3 September 1939:** War declared
- **Early October 1939:** Work suspended by Admiralty
- One-year suspension ordered
- Construction of 16-inch guns and turrets continued
- Shipyard workers reassigned to more urgent projects

### November 1939: Brief Resumption
- **15 November 1939:** Work authorized to resume "whenever there was available labour"
- Very limited progress
- Only when no urgent work available
- Mostly maintenance of what had been built

### May 1940: Permanent Suspension
- **May 1940:** All work permanently suspended
- Fall of France changed priorities
- Destroyers, corvettes, landing craft more urgent
- Lion and Temeraire remained on slipways

### 1942: Design Revision
- Design thoroughly revised incorporating war lessons
- Increased displacement to ~50,000 tons
- Improved horizontal armor (against bombs)
- Enhanced torpedo defense
- Some proposals reduced armament to 6× 16-inch guns (2 triple turrets)
- Strengthened flight deck for aircraft operations

### October 1942: Cancellation
- Director of Naval Construction wrote to shipyards
- "Requesting them to clear the slipways and reuse the material"
- **Lion and Temeraire scrapped on slipways**
- Steel recycled for escort vessels and landing craft
- 16-inch gun turrets placed in storage

## 1942-1945 Revised Design

**1942-1943 War Modifications:**
- Displacement increased to **~50,000 tons**
- Horizontal armor increased from 6" to **9-10 inches** (bomb protection)
- Beam increased to **108 feet** (improved torpedo defense)
- Some proposals: Reduce to **6× 16-inch guns** (2 turrets) to save weight
- Enhanced AA armament
- Radar and fire control improvements

**1944-1945 Post-War Studies:**
- Further revisions for 1945 Naval Programme
- Displacement approached **55,000 tons**
- Emphasis on air defense and horizontal protection
- **Rejected October 1945** as unaffordable
- Post-war austerity killed any chance

**Why Design Evolution Failed:**
- Weight spiraled upward with each revision
- Cost prohibitive
- Jet aircraft made battleships obsolete
- Carrier aviation prioritized
- Financial constraints

## Why They Were Cancelled

**Immediate War Priorities (1939-1940):**
- Destroyers and escorts desperately needed for convoy defense
- U-boat threat prioritized
- ASW vessels more valuable than battleships
- Shipyard labor and material diverted

**Strategic Situation (1940-1942):**
- Fall of France (May-June 1940) changed strategic picture
- No German battleship threat (Bismarck sunk 1941, Tirpitz hiding)
- Japanese not yet enemy (until December 1941)
- Aircraft carriers more valuable than battleships
- Battle of Britain showed air power dominance

**Resource Constraints:**
- Steel needed for merchant ships, landing craft, destroyers
- Shipyard capacity limited
- 3-4 year construction time unacceptable
- King George V-class sufficient for needs

**Post-War (1945):**
- Financial austerity
- Carrier aviation prioritized
- Battleship era clearly ending
- Atomic weapons changed naval warfare
- HMS Vanguard (completed 1946) was enough

## Fate of 16-Inch Guns

**Guns Already in Production:**
- Multiple 16-inch/45 Mk II gun barrels manufactured
- Three triple turrets in various stages of construction
- Extensive investment already made

**Post-War Storage:**
- Guns and turrets placed in storage
- Considered for shore batteries
- Proposals for fitting to Vanguard (rejected)
- Some used as test weapons

**Final Disposition:**
- Eventually scrapped 1950s-1960s
- Never fired in anger
- Never mounted on a warship
- Expensive waste of resources

## What If They Had Been Completed?

**Potential Service:**
- Earliest completion: 1943-1944 (Lion, Temeraire)
- Too late for critical early war period
- Would have missed Battle of Atlantic
- Could have served Pacific 1944-1945

**Hypothetical Capabilities:**
- Most powerful British battleships ever
- Superior to King George V-class
- Comparable to American Iowa-class
- Outgunned by Yamato but faster

**Strategic Value:**
- Marginal by 1943-1944
- Carriers dominated Pacific War
- Aircraft more effective than battleship guns
- Enormous cost for limited utility

**Post-War Role:**
- Could have served 1946-1960s like Iowa-class
- Shore bombardment (Korea)
- Training and show-the-flag
- But Britain couldn't afford to operate them

## Comparison to Contemporaries

| Class | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Armor (belt) | Status |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Lion (1939)** | UK | Cancelled | 40,550 tons | 30 kn | 9× 16" (3×3) | 15-13" | Laid down, scrapped 1942 |
| Iowa | USA | 1943 | 45,000 tons | 33 kn | 9× 16" (3×3) | 12.1" | 4 built, all served |
| Yamato | Japan | 1941 | 65,000 tons | 27 kn | 9× 18.1" (3×3) | 16.1" | 2 built, both sunk |
| Bismarck | Germany | 1940 | 42,300 tons | 30 kn | 8× 15" (4×2) | 12.6" | 2 built, both sunk |
| Vanguard | UK | 1946 | 44,500 tons | 30 kn | 8× 15" (4×2) | 14" | 1 built, scrapped 1960 |

**Analysis:** Lion would have been comparable to Iowa, inferior to Yamato but better balanced than King George V.

## Design Assessment

**Strengths:**
- 9× 16-inch guns (superior to KGV's 14-inch)
- 30-knot speed (fast enough for fleet operations)
- Better armor than KGV
- Improved underwater protection
- Modern dual-purpose secondary armament

**Weaknesses:**
- Still smaller than Iowa or Yamato
- Only 15-inch belt armor (vs Iowa's protection scheme)
- Horizontal armor insufficient initially
- Large target for air attack
- Expensive and slow to build

**Overall:**
- Well-balanced design for 1939
- Would have been excellent in 1941-1943
- Obsolescent by 1944-1945
- Cancellation probably correct decision

## Legacy

**Largest British Battleship Designed:**
- 40,000+ tons standard (larger than any British battleship)
- Only Vanguard came close (44,500 tons)
- Most ambitious Royal Navy battleship project

**Last British Battleship Design:**
- No battleships designed after 1945 revisions
- HMS Vanguard (1946) was last British battleship completed
- Carrier aviation took priority post-war
- End of British battleship era

**"What Might Have Been":**
- Popular subject for naval historians
- Numerous books and articles
- Alternative history scenarios
- Symbol of British naval ambition

**Material Salvaged:**
- Steel from Lion and Temeraire recycled
- Used for destroyers, corvettes, landing craft
- More valuable contribution than as battleships
- Practical decision in desperate circumstances
