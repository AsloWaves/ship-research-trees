# St Vincent-Class Dreadnought Battleships (1908-1910)

## Overview
The St Vincent-class were three dreadnought battleships built 1907-1910, featuring 12-inch/50 cal guns (longer barrels than earlier dreadnoughts), improved fire control, and 21-knot speed. As the third British dreadnought class, they incorporated incremental improvements while maintaining the proven all-big-gun layout. HMS St Vincent, HMS Collingwood, and HMS Vanguard served throughout WWI with the Grand Fleet, participating in Jutland (1916). HMS Vanguard was destroyed by internal magazine explosion (1917, 804 killed). Survivors scrapped 1921.

- North Sea exercises and war games
- Gunnery practice with new 50-caliber guns
- Fleet reviews and diplomatic missions
- Tactical development

**Mediterranean Deployment:**
- Brief deployments for flag-showing
- Fleet exercises with allied navies
- Training and readiness drills

### World War I (1914-1918)

**Grand Fleet Service:**
- 4th Battle Squadron (later 1st Battle Squadron)
- Scapa Flow and Rosyth bases
- North Sea patrols and sweeps
- Maintained constant readiness
- Core of British battle line

**Battle of Jutland (31 May - 1 June 1916):**
- All three ships participated
- 1st Battle Squadron, Vice-Admiral Jerram
- Engaged German High Seas Fleet battleline
- Heavy firing during fleet action

**Jutland Performance:**
- **HMS St Vincent**: Fired 85× 12-inch shells

**HMS Vanguard Disaster (9 July 1917):**
- **Location**: Scapa Flow, at anchor
- **Cause**: Internal magazine explosion (cause uncertain)
- **Details**: Massive explosion destroyed entire ship
- **Casualties**: 804 killed (out of 845), only 41 survivors (2 crew + 39 onshore)
- **Investigation**: Likely unstable cordite, though cause never definitively established
- **Impact**: Worst RN loss of life in single incident (until HMS Hood 1941)
- **Lessons**: Magazine safety and cordite stability critical concerns

**Later War Service (Survivors):**
- HMS St Vincent and HMS Collingwood continued North Sea operations

- Reduced crews post-Armistice

## Design Assessment

### Strengths
- 50-caliber guns superior range and accuracy
- 21-knot speed (tactical advantage)
- Good protection scheme
- Reliable machinery and systems
- Enhanced fire control

### Weaknesses
- Only 10× 12-inch guns (later super-dreadnoughts had 13.5-inch)
- Armor adequate but not exceptional
- Magazine safety concerns (Vanguard explosion)
- Outclassed by super-dreadnoughts by 1912
- Lower freeboard than ideal (wet in heavy seas)

### Historical Significance
- Validated longer-gun concept
- Demonstrated importance of range and accuracy
- Jutland performance proved design worth
- Vanguard disaster highlighted magazine safety issues
- Last British dreadnoughts with 12-inch guns (next used 13.5-inch)

## HMS Vanguard Disaster (9 July 1917)

### The Explosion
- **Date**: 9 July 1917, 23:20 hours
- **Location**: Scapa Flow (at anchor)
- **Witnesses**: Massive explosion visible across fleet
- **Details**: Ship destroyed instantly, broke in two, sank immediately
- **Duration**: Less than 90 seconds from explosion to complete sinking

### Casualties
- **Total Crew**: 845
- **Killed**: 804 (includes 2 survivors who died from injuries)
- **Survivors**: 2 on ship + 39 ashore on leave
- **Recovery**: Most bodies never recovered
- **Impact**: Worst RN peacetime loss until HMS Hood (1941)

### Investigation
- **Royal Navy Board of Inquiry**: Inconclusive
- **Likely Cause**: Unstable cordite in magazine
- **Alternative Theories**: Electrical fault, spontaneous combustion, sabotage (ruled out)
- **Verdict**: Accidental explosion, exact cause unknown
- **Recommendations**: Improved magazine cooling, cordite inspection, safety procedures

### Similar Incidents
- HMS Bulwark (1914): 738 killed, magazine explosion
- HMS Natasha (1915): Russian battleship, magazine explosion
- Multiple cordite-related incidents 1914-1918
- Demonstrated persistent magazine safety problem

## Battle of Jutland (1916)

### 1st Battle Squadron Performance
- Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram
- HMS St Vincent
- HMS Collingwood
- HMS Vanguard
- Deployed in main battle line

**Engagement:**
- **17:00-19:30**: Extended engagement with German battleships
- **Range**: 14,000-16,000 yards (50-cal guns effective)
- **HMS Collingwood**: Confirmed hit on SMS Markgraf
- **Results**: Contributed to forcing German withdrawal

**Assessment:**
- Long-range gunnery effective
- 50-caliber guns performed as designed
- Fire control adequate
- Solid performance in line
- No major damage sustained

## Comparison to Contemporaries

### vs Bellerophon-Class (Britain, 1907)
- **St Vincent**: 12-inch/50 vs Bellerophon: 12-inch/45 (longer guns)
- **St Vincent**: 21 knots vs Bellerophon: 20.75 knots (faster)
- **St Vincent**: Better fire control
- **Verdict**: St Vincent clear improvement

### vs HMS Neptune (Britain, 1909)
- **Neptune**: Experimental superfiring layout
- **St Vincent**: Conventional wing turrets
- **Neptune**: Better turret arrangement but teething problems
- **Verdict**: St Vincent more reliable, Neptune more advanced

### vs Helgoland-Class (Germany, 1909)
- **St Vincent**: 10× 12-inch vs Helgoland: 12× 12-inch
- **Germany**: More guns but shorter range
- **St Vincent**: 21 knots vs Helgoland: 20.5 knots
- **Verdict**: German firepower, British range and speed

### vs USS Delaware (USA, 1909)
- **St Vincent**: 10× 12-inch vs Delaware: 10× 12-inch (similar)
- **Delaware**: Superfiring turrets (better layout)
- **St Vincent**: Conventional wing turrets
- **Verdict**: US better turret arrangement

## Legacy

**Design Evolution:**
- Last British 12-inch gun dreadnoughts
- Led to super-dreadnoughts (13.5-inch/45 Orion-class 1910)
- Validated long-range gunnery concept
- Demonstrated need for superfiring turrets (next classes adopted)

**Operational Impact:**
- Core of Grand Fleet 1914-1918
- Jutland participants (proved effectiveness)
- HMS Vanguard loss highlighted magazine safety
- Maintained British naval supremacy

**Magazine Safety Legacy:**
- Vanguard disaster led to enhanced safety procedures
- Cordite stability and storage improvements
- Temperature monitoring in magazines
- Influenced all subsequent battleship designs

**Tactical Lessons:**
- Long-range gunnery critical (50-cal guns validated)
- Speed advantage tactical benefit
- Magazine safety cannot be compromised
- Reliable designs preferred over experimental

**Quote:**
"The St Vincent-class marked the peak of British 12-inch gun dreadnought design before the leap to 13.5-inch super-dreadnoughts. Their WWI service culminated in Jutland success but was overshadowed by HMS Vanguard's tragic loss at Scapa Flow - a devastating reminder that the greatest threat to a battleship could come from within."
