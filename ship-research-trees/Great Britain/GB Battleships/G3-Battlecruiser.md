# G3 Battlecruiser (Cancelled 1921)

## Overview
The G3 battlecruisers were a class of battlecruisers planned by the Royal Navy after World War I in response to naval expansion programmes by the United States and Japan. Four ships were ordered in 1921 but were cancelled later that year under the Washington Naval Treaty before any were laid down. The G3s would have been the most powerful battlecruisers ever built, combining heavy firepower, strong protection, and high speed.

## Design

### Revolutionary Features

The G3 design incorporated several revolutionary features that would have made them the most advanced capital ships of their era:

1. **All-or-nothing armor scheme** - Concentrated thick armor over vital areas
2. **Triple 16-inch gun turrets** - First British design with 16-inch guns
3. **High speed** - 32 knots, faster than any contemporary battleship
4. **Powerful secondary battery** - 16× 6-inch guns in twin turrets
5. **Long range** - 7,000 nautical miles
6. **Advanced fire control** - Director control for all guns

### Main Armament

The G3s were designed to carry nine 16-inch/45 caliber guns in three triple turrets, all mounted forward of the superstructure. This unusual arrangement placed:
- Two turrets superfiring forward
- One turret aft of the superstructure, also forward-facing

This forward concentration of firepower was similar to the later Royal Navy's Nelson-class battleships, which were essentially treaty-limited derivatives of the G3 design.

### Armor Protection

The G3 design used an "all-or-nothing" armor scheme:
- **Belt armor:** 14 inches over machinery and magazines
- **Deck armor:** 8 inches (heavy horizontal protection)
- **Turret armor:** 14-17 inches
- **Conning tower:** 12 inches
- **Unprotected areas:** Minimal or no armor to save weight

This was a revolutionary departure from the incremental armor schemes of WWI battlecruisers, providing protection against 16-inch shells at battle ranges.

### Propulsion

The G3s were designed with four-shaft geared steam turbines producing 160,000 shaft horsepower, giving them a design speed of 32 knots - making them faster than any battleship afloat and as fast as contemporary battlecruisers, but with much heavier armor.

## Ordered Ships

Four G3 battlecruisers were ordered:

| Ship Name | Ordered | Builder | Fate |
|-----------|---------|---------|------|
| **G3** (name not selected) | October 1921 | Fairfield Shipbuilding | Cancelled November 1921 |
| **G3** (name not selected) | October 1921 | John Brown & Company | Cancelled November 1921 |
| **G3** (name not selected) | November 1921 | Swan Hunter | Cancelled November 1921 |
| **G3** (name not selected) | November 1921 | Cammell Laird | Cancelled November 1921 |

Names were not assigned before cancellation, though "Invincible," "Inflexible," "Indomitable," and "Indefatigable" were likely candidates.

## Development History

### Background

Following World War I, the Royal Navy faced new threats from the United States and Japan, both of which were building large numbers of powerful battleships and battlecruisers:

- **United States:** Lexington-class battlecruisers (8× 16-inch guns, 33 knots)
- **Japan:** Amagi-class battlecruisers (10× 16-inch guns, 30 knots)
- **Japan:** Kii-class battleships (10× 16-inch guns, 29.75 knots)

### Design Process

The G3 design evolved through 1920-1921 under the direction of Director of Naval Construction Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt. The design went through multiple iterations to balance:

1. **Firepower** - 16-inch guns to match or exceed foreign designs
2. **Protection** - Heavy armor to survive 16-inch shell hits
3. **Speed** - 32 knots to catch or escape from any enemy
4. **Treaty compliance** - Initial designs ignored treaty limits

### Board Approval

The G3 design was approved by the Board of Admiralty on **12 August 1921**, with four ships ordered in October and November 1921.

### Washington Naval Treaty

The **Washington Naval Conference** began in November 1921, shortly after the G3s were ordered. The resulting **Washington Naval Treaty** (signed 6 February 1922) imposed:

- **Capital ship holiday:** No new battleships or battlecruisers for 10 years
- **Tonnage limits:** Maximum 35,000 tons standard displacement
- **Gun limits:** Maximum 16-inch guns (but G3s complied)

### Cancellation

Work on the G3 battlecruisers was **suspended in November 1921** with the beginning of the Washington Naval Conference. The ships were **formally cancelled** before any were laid down.

The Royal Navy was allowed to build **two new battleships** under the Washington Treaty to replace older ships. These became the **Nelson-class battleships**, which were essentially scaled-down, slower (23 knots vs 32 knots) versions of the G3 design to fit the 35,000-ton treaty limit.

## Comparison to Other Designs

### G3 vs Hood (Previous RN Battlecruiser)

| Characteristic | G3 | HMS Hood |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| Displacement | 48,400 tons | 42,000 tons |
| Speed | 32 knots | 31 knots |
| Main guns | 9× 16-inch | 8× 15-inch |
| Belt armor | 14 inches | 12 inches |
| Deck armor | 8 inches | 3 inches |

The G3 design was significantly better protected than Hood, especially against plunging fire (deck armor 8" vs 3").

### G3 vs Nelson (Treaty Derivative)

| Characteristic | G3 | Nelson |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Displacement | 48,400 tons | 33,950 tons |
| Speed | 32 knots | 23 knots |
| Main guns | 9× 16-inch | 9× 16-inch |
| Belt armor | 14 inches | 14 inches |
| Gun arrangement | 3 triple forward | 3 triple forward |

The Nelson-class retained the G3's armament and armor layout but sacrificed speed and size to meet treaty limits.

### G3 vs Foreign Contemporaries

**vs Lexington-class (USA):**
- G3: 9× 16-inch, 32 knots, 14" belt
- Lexington: 8× 16-inch, 33 knots, 7" belt
- **Advantage:** G3 had heavier armament and much better protection

**vs Amagi-class (Japan):**
- G3: 9× 16-inch, 32 knots, 14" belt
- Amagi: 10× 16-inch, 30 knots, 10" belt
- **Advantage:** G3 had better protection, Amagi had one more gun

## Legacy and Impact

### Nelson-Class Battleships

The G3 design directly influenced the **Nelson-class battleships** (HMS Nelson and HMS Rodney), which were authorized under the Washington Treaty:

- Same 9× 16-inch gun arrangement (3 triple turrets forward)
- Same all-or-nothing armor scheme
- Reduced to 35,000 tons treaty limit
- Speed reduced to 23 knots (vs 32 knots)

### Influence on Future Designs

The G3 design influenced:

1. **King George V-class (1936):** British fast battleships adopted high speed + heavy armor
2. **Iowa-class (USA):** American fast battleships combined speed, armor, and firepower
3. **All-or-nothing armor:** Became standard for all future battleships

### International Impact

The G3 design contributed to the naval arms race that led to the **Washington Naval Treaty**:

- G3 design shocked the United States and Japan
- Demonstrated British willingness to build extremely powerful ships
- Helped convince nations that unlimited naval competition was unsustainable
- Led to the Washington Treaty "battleship holiday"

## Technical Innovation

### Gun Layout

The unusual arrangement of all three 16-inch turrets forward of the superstructure offered several advantages:

**Advantages:**
- Concentrated firepower for broadside fire
- Better protection (machinery spaces farther aft)
- Reduced torpedo danger to magazines
- Simplified armor layout

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited stern arc of fire
- Unusual appearance
- Top-heavy (high center of gravity)

This layout was later used on the Nelson-class and influenced some foreign designs.

### Fire Control

The G3 design incorporated advanced fire control systems:

- Director control for all guns (main, secondary, AA)
- 15-foot rangefinders in main turrets
- 30-foot rangefinder in director control tower
- Advanced mechanical fire control computers

### Propulsion

The G3s were designed with **geared steam turbines** to efficiently produce 32 knots. The geared turbines allowed:

- Higher propeller efficiency
- Better fuel economy at cruising speeds
- Reduced engine size and weight
- Higher maximum speed

## What If: G3 in Service

Had the G3 battlecruisers been built, they would have been the most powerful warships in the world from 1924-1930:

### Hypothetical Capabilities

1. **Engagement range:** Could engage any enemy at 30,000+ yards with 16-inch guns
2. **Speed advantage:** 32 knots allowed them to catch or escape from any contemporary battleship
3. **Protection:** 14-inch belt and 8-inch deck could resist 16-inch shells at battle ranges
4. **Firepower:** Nine 16-inch guns matched or exceeded any foreign design

### Hypothetical WWII Service

If G3 battlecruisers had been built and survived to WWII:

**Advantages:**
- Heavy armor would have prevented a Hood-style catastrophic loss
- 16-inch guns more powerful than actual RN battleships (14-15 inches)
- 32-knot speed valuable for carrier escorts and hunting commerce raiders

**Disadvantages:**
- Large size (856 ft) difficult to dock and maintain
- High fuel consumption at 32 knots
- Would have been 20+ years old by 1940
- Expensive to modernize

### Comparison to HMS Hood's Fate

HMS Hood was sunk by Bismarck in 1941 due to inadequate deck armor (3 inches). A G3 battlecruiser with 8-inch deck armor would likely have survived the same hit.

## Conclusion

The G3 battlecruisers represented the ultimate evolution of the battlecruiser concept: a ship combining battleship-level firepower and protection with cruiser-level speed. Their cancellation under the Washington Naval Treaty denied the Royal Navy what would have been the most powerful warships in the world.

The design's influence lived on in the Nelson-class battleships and established principles (all-or-nothing armor, high speed, heavy guns) that defined battleship design for the next two decades.
