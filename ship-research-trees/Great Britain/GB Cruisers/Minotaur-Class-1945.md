- Pacific operations 1945
- Too late for major combat
- Effective modern ships

**Post-War:**
- Several completed ships had long careers
- Some converted to different roles
- Tiger and Blake became helicopter cruisers
- HMCS Ontario served Canada

## Conversions

**HMS Tiger and HMS Blake:**
- Completed 1959 and 1961
- Helicopter cruiser conversions
- Tiger further modified in 1970s
- Last RN gun cruisers

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Final WWII cruiser design
- Good combat characteristics
- Too late for war
- Influenced postwar designs

**Historical Significance:**
- Most completed postwar
- Some never finished
- Tiger and Blake became helicopter cruisers
- End of gun cruiser era for RN

**Post-War Evolution:**
