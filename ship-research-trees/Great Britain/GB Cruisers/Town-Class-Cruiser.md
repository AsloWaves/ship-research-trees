| Class | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Town** | UK | 1937 | 11,540 tons | 32 kn | 12× 6" (4×3) | 4/10 lost, Belfast preserved |
| Brooklyn | USA | 1937 | 10,000 tons | 32.5 kn | 15× 6" (5×3) | All scrapped |
| Mogami | Japan | 1935 | 11,200 tons | 35 kn | 15× 6.1" (5×3) | All sunk WWII |
