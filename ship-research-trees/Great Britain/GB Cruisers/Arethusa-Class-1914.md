# Arethusa-Class Light Cruisers (1914)

## Overview
The Arethusa-class were the Royal Navy's first purpose-built light cruisers, designed to lead destroyer flotillas and counter German light cruisers. Eight ships represented a new type of warship optimized for speed and firepower rather than armor. They served extensively in WWI, particularly in the North Sea.

- Minimal armor for speed
- Strong torpedo armament

**Key Features:**
- Small, fast design
- Mixed 6-inch and 4-inch battery
- Eight torpedo tubes
- Oil-fired boilers

**Design Philosophy:**
- Counter German light cruisers
