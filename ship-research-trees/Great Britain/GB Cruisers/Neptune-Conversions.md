# Neptune-Class Cruiser Conversions (Cancelled)

## Overview
The Neptune-class represented a series of proposed conversion plans for existing cruisers to guided missile cruisers in the 1950s. Various schemes were studied to convert Tiger, Blake, and other cruisers into missile-armed ships, but all were ultimately cancelled in favor of new-build guided missile destroyers.

## Design Proposals

**Conversion Concept:**
- Convert existing cruisers to missile ships
- Seaslug missile system
- Remove main gun armament
- Modern radar and fire control

**Proposed Modifications:**
- Seaslug launcher aft
- Magazine and handling systems
- Type 984 3D radar
- Modern combat information center
- Reduced gun armament

**Candidate Ships:**
- HMS Neptune (proposed name)
- Tiger-class cruisers
- Colony-class cruisers
- Minotaur-class cruisers

## Cancellation

**Reasons for Cancellation:**
- Excessive conversion costs
- Aging hull structures
- County-class DLG program preferred
- Limited operational value
- Better to build new ships

**Alternative:**
- County-class guided missile destroyers chosen
- New construction more cost-effective
- Better capabilities
- Modern systems integration

## Specifications (Proposed)

| Characteristic | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Displacement** | ~12,500 tons standard, ~15,000 tons full |
| **Dimensions** | 555 ft × 64 ft × 17 ft |
| **Propulsion** | Existing steam turbines, 72,500 shp |
| **Speed** | 31 knots |
| **Range** | 8,000 nmi at 13 knots |
| **Armament** | Seaslug SAM<br/>4× 3-inch AA<br/>Sea Cat<br/>1 helicopter |
| **Electronics** | Type 984 3D radar<br/>Modern fire control |

## Related Programs

**County-Class DLG:**
- New-build guided missile destroyers
- Seaslug missile system
- More cost-effective
- Eight ships completed

**Tiger Helicopter Conversion:**
- Alternative use for Tiger and Blake
- Helicopter cruiser role
- Actually completed
- Limited success

## Legacy

**Design Impact:**
- Showed conversion uneconomical
- Led to new-build missile ships
- Influenced County-class
- Demonstrated need for purpose-built designs

**Historical Significance:**
- Represented end of gun cruiser concept
- Transition to missile age
- Economic realities of conversions
- New construction preferred

**Lessons Learned:**
- Converting old ships expensive
- Purpose-built designs better
- Modern systems need modern hulls
- Cost-effectiveness critical
