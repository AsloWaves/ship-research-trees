# Monmouth-Class Armored Cruisers (1903)

## Overview
The Monmouth-class were County-type armored cruisers built for trade protection and colonial service. Ten ships served globally, with two lost at the Battle of Coronel in 1914. They sacrificed heavy main armament for a uniform 6-inch battery, emphasizing broadside firepower over heavyweight guns.

## Design

**County-Type Armored Cruiser:**
- Uniform 6-inch battery (no large guns)
- Lighter armor for extended range
- Trade protection emphasis
- Good speed (23 knots)

**Design Philosophy:**
- High rate of fire over heavy punch
- Extended endurance
- Colonial station service
- Cost-effective design

## Ships and Fates

## Battle of Coronel (November 1, 1914)

**British Defeat:**
- HMS Monmouth heavily damaged by German fire
- Attempted to escape but caught by SMS Nürnberg
- Sank with all 735 hands
- No survivors

**Tactical Issues:**
- Outgunned by German armored cruisers
- Poor gunnery conditions (silhouetted against sunset)
- 6-inch guns inadequate against German 8.2-inch

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Controversial uniform 6-inch battery
- Good for trade protection
- Inadequate for fleet action
- Weak armor (4-inch belt)

**Combat Lessons:**
- Outmatched by heavier armored cruisers
- Demonstrated need for heavy guns
- Valuable for colonial service
- Not suitable for major fleet actions
