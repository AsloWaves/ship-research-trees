## Historical Background

The Grumman TBF Avenger was the US Navy's standard torpedo bomber from 1942 to the end of WWII, replacing the obsolete TBD Devastator whose squadrons were decimated at Midway. The Avenger proved far more survivable, with armor protection, self-sealing fuel tanks, and a powered turret.

Despite their disastrous debut at Midway (5 of 6 TBFs lost), Avengers went on to sink numerous Japanese warships including the super-battleships Yamato and Musashi. Future President George H.W. Bush flew TBMs with VT-51.

The aircraft's large bomb bay could accommodate a Mark 13 torpedo, 2,000 lbs of bombs, or depth charges, making it versatile for anti-submarine and ground attack missions as well as torpedo strikes.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for game balance*

- **Role**: Primary US torpedo/strike aircraft
- **Strengths**: Versatility, survivability, defensive armament, crew protection
- **Weaknesses**: Slower than dive bombers, large target
- **Historical Accuracy**: Very high - workhorse of Pacific carrier operations
- **Comparable Aircraft**: B6N Jill (faster), Barracuda (UK)

### Tactical Tips
- Use fighter escort against defended targets
- Coordinate attacks to split AA fire
- Consider bombing when torpedo attacks are suicidal
- ASW loadout excellent for convoy escort
