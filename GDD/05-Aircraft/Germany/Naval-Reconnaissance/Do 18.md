## History

The Dornier Do 18 was Germany's primary maritime reconnaissance flying boat in the late 1930s and early years of World War II. Developed from the record-breaking Do 16 mail plane, the Do 18 combined Dornier's distinctive sponson hull design with efficient diesel engines mounted in a unique tandem push-pull configuration above the wing.

The aircraft first gained fame in peacetime when a Do 18 set a seaplane distance record of 8,391 km in March 1938. By the outbreak of war, Do 18s equipped several Küstenfliegergruppen (coastal aviation groups) and saw extensive service in the North Sea and Baltic. The type's diesel engines provided excellent range and fuel economy, making it ideal for long maritime patrols.

However, the Do 18 proved vulnerable to enemy fighters, suffering heavy losses early in the war. Its defensive armament was inadequate and performance modest. By 1940, most Do 18s in frontline reconnaissance units were replaced by the superior Bv 138. Surviving Do 18s were relegated to air-sea rescue duties with Seenotdienst units, equipped with medical supplies, survival equipment, and rescue rafts. In this role, they served effectively until 1943, saving numerous downed airmen from both sides in accordance with rescue protocols.
