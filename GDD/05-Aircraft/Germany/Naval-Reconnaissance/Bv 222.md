## History

The Blohm & Voss Bv 222 Wiking was the largest flying boat to achieve operational status during World War II and remained the largest flying boat ever built until the post-war era. Originally designed as a transatlantic airliner for Deutsche Lufthansa, the prototype was commandeered by the Luftwaffe upon completion in 1940 and pressed into military transport service.

The massive six-engine aircraft proved invaluable for long-range transport missions, particularly supporting Rommel's Afrika Korps by flying supplies and personnel across the Mediterranean from bases in Greece. The Bv 222's enormous capacity allowed it to carry up to 92 fully-equipped troops or 72 stretcher patients, making it crucial for evacuating wounded soldiers. The type also served in maritime reconnaissance roles over the Atlantic and Arctic oceans.

Despite heavy defensive armament, Bv 222s were vulnerable to fighter attack due to their size and relatively modest performance. Several were lost to Allied fighters and anti-aircraft fire. The aircraft also suffered from chronic engine reliability problems, as the Bramo 323 engines were overstressed by the massive airframe. Only 13 were completed before production ceased in 1944. Three surviving aircraft were captured by the Allies at the war's end and briefly tested before being scrapped.
