## History

The Ha 139 began life as a transatlantic mail seaplane for Deutsche Lufthansa, designed to carry mail between Europe and the Americas via catapult launch from depot ships in the mid-Atlantic. Built by Hamburger Flugzeugbau (later absorbed into Blohm & Voss), the aircraft featured four diesel engines and an impressive range of 5,000 km.

Between 1937 and 1939, three Ha 139s operated commercially on Lufthansa's South Atlantic mail route, being catapult-launched from depot ships stationed in the mid-Atlantic. This innovative system allowed for faster mail delivery than traditional steamships. The aircraft proved reliable and efficient in this demanding role, establishing several seaplane performance records.

With the outbreak of World War II, the five existing Ha 139s (three civil aircraft plus two military variants) were impressed into Luftwaffe service for long-range maritime reconnaissance. Armed and equipped with radio and navigation equipment, they operated from Norwegian fjords and French coastal bases, conducting patrols over the North Atlantic. Their exceptional range made them valuable for tracking Allied convoys far from land, though their small numbers limited their impact. Most were lost to accidents or combat by 1943, with the survivors relegated to transport duties.
