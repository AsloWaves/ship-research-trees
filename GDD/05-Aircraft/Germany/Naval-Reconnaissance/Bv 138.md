## History

The Blohm & Voss Bv 138 was Nazi Germany's most important maritime patrol flying boat, serving throughout World War II in reconnaissance, anti-submarine, and convoy escort roles. Nicknamed the "Fliegender Holzschuh" (Flying Clog) due to its distinctive shape, the aircraft featured an unusual twin-boom configuration with three engines mounted above the wing.

Development was troubled, with early Ha 138 prototypes proving dangerously unstable. Extensive redesign by Blohm & Voss engineer Hermann Pohlmann transformed the aircraft into a reliable platform. The production Bv 138 entered service in 1940 and quickly proved invaluable for long-range maritime patrol operations, particularly in Arctic waters, the North Atlantic, and Mediterranean.

Bv 138s operated from coastal bases, sheltered fjords, and even from specially-equipped submarine supply vessels. They played crucial roles in detecting Allied convoys, directing U-boats to targets, air-sea rescue operations, and direct attacks on shipping with depth charges. The type's long endurance and robust construction made it ideal for operations in harsh Arctic conditions. Despite being vulnerable to fighter attack, the Bv 138 remained in service until the war's end, with some units operating until May 1945.
