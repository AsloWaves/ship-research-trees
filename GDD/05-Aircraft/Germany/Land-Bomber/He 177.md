## History

The Heinkel He 177 Greif was Germany's only operational long-range heavy bomber, but it was plagued by problems that prevented it from ever reaching its potential. The aircraft's design was compromised from the start by a requirement that it be capable of dive-bombing - an absurd demand for a heavy bomber that resulted in significant structural complications.

The He 177's most notorious feature was its paired engine configuration: four engines mounted in two nacelles, with each nacelle containing two coupled DB 605 engines driving a single propeller through a complex gearbox. This arrangement was intended to reduce drag, but the tightly-cowled engines suffered chronic overheating problems. Engine fires were so common that crews nicknamed the aircraft "Flaming Coffin" (Luftwaffenfeuerzeug). Many He 177s were lost to in-flight fires having nothing to do with enemy action.

Despite these problems, the He 177 saw extensive service from 1942 to 1945, particularly on the Eastern Front and in anti-shipping operations. When it worked, the aircraft had impressive capabilities: long range, heavy bomb load, and the ability to carry advanced guided weapons like the Hs 293 anti-ship missile and Fritz X guided bomb. He 177s attacked Arctic convoys, struck targets deep in the Soviet Union, and participated in operations against Allied shipping in the Atlantic. However, operational availability was always poor due to mechanical problems, and many missions ended in disaster due to engine failures. The type never achieved the success Germany desperately needed from a strategic bomber.

## Notable Features

- Unique coupled engine configuration (four engines, two propellers)
- Only operational German long-range heavy bomber
- Could carry Hs 293 and Fritz X guided missiles
- Dive-bombing capability (rarely used)
- Chronic engine fire problems
- Remote-controlled defensive gun positions
- Long range for strategic missions
- Sophisticated but unreliable design
