## History

The Dornier Do 17Z was the final production variant of the famous "Flying Pencil" (Fliegender Bleistift), nicknamed for its slender fuselage. The Z variant featured a completely redesigned forward fuselage with an extensively glazed "beetle's eye" nose that provided excellent visibility and housed three defensive machine guns. This represented a significant improvement over earlier variants with their limited defensive armament and cramped crew positions.

The Do 17Z entered service in January 1939 and equipped numerous Kampfgeschwader bomber units. It saw extensive combat during the Polish Campaign, the Battle of France, and particularly the Battle of Britain in 1940. During the Battle of Britain, Do 17Zs of KG 2, KG 3, and KG 76 formed a significant portion of the Luftwaffe's bomber force. However, the type's modest bomb load, inadequate defensive armament, and relatively slow speed made it vulnerable to RAF fighters, and losses were heavy.

By 1941, the Do 17Z was clearly obsolescent, outperformed by the Ju 88 and He 111. Most bomber units transitioned to more capable types, though Do 17Zs continued serving in reconnaissance, training, and secondary roles until 1943. Some were converted to night fighters (Do 17Z-10 Kauz) with additional cannon and radar, serving as interim night fighters before specialized types became available. The Do 17 series was important in the early war years but was quickly superseded by more advanced designs.
