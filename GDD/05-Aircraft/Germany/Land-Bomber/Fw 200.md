## History

The Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor began life as a civilian airliner designed for Deutsche Lufthansa's long-range routes. It set several long-distance records in the late 1930s, including Berlin to New York in 1938, and was considered one of the finest airliners of its era. However, with the outbreak of World War II, the Condor was hastily adapted into a long-range maritime patrol bomber and transport aircraft.

Winston Churchill famously called the Fw 200 the "Scourge of the Atlantic" during 1940-1941, when Condors operating from French bases wreaked havoc on Allied convoys. The aircraft's exceptional range allowed it to patrol far into the Atlantic, far beyond the reach of land-based Allied fighters. Condors would shadow convoys, report their positions to U-boat wolf packs, and attack stragglers with bombs. In the first six months of 1941, Fw 200s claimed over 90 merchant ships totaling more than 360,000 tons.

However, the Condor's success was short-lived. The type was structurally weak - its airframe was never designed for the stresses of military operations and low-level flight, leading to frequent structural failures. The introduction of long-range Allied fighters, escort carriers, and CAM ships with Hurricane fighters dramatically increased losses. Improved convoy defenses made Condor operations increasingly costly, and by 1943, the type was primarily relegated to transport duties, particularly supply missions to North Africa and the Eastern Front. Nevertheless, the Fw 200 demonstrated the potential of long-range maritime patrol aircraft and influenced post-war maritime patrol doctrine.

## Notable Features

- Originally designed as long-range civilian airliner
- Exceptional range for maritime patrol
- Structural weakness due to non-military design origin
- Four-engine configuration for reliability
- Forward ventral gondola for bomb-aimer
- Could carry bombs, depth charges, or mines
- Later variants equipped with FuG 200 Hohentwiel search radar
- Served as both bomber and VIP transport (including Hitler's personal transport)
- Nicknamed "Scourge of the Atlantic" by Churchill
