## History

The Arado Ar 234 Blitz holds the distinction of being the world's first operational jet bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. Designed by Walter Blume, it was a sleek, purpose-built jet aircraft that exploited the advantages of turbojet propulsion for high-speed reconnaissance and bombing missions. Unlike the Me 262 which was adapted from a fighter design, the Ar 234 was conceived from the outset for the bomber/reconnaissance role.

The first operational Ar 234s were reconnaissance variants (Ar 234B-1) which entered service in September 1944 with Sonderkommando Götz and later Sonderkommando Hecht. These unarmed photo-reconnaissance aircraft operated with near-impunity over Allied-held territory, as their 740+ km/h speed made interception by Allied fighters virtually impossible. They provided valuable intelligence on Allied movements, including monitoring the Remagen Bridge crossing and tracking Allied advances.

The bomber variant (Ar 234B-2) entered service in late 1944 and participated in the Battle of the Bulge, making it the only jet bomber to see combat in World War II. Ar 234s attacked the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen in March 1945, attempting unsuccessfully to destroy it and prevent Allied forces from crossing the Rhine. The aircraft's speed made it difficult to intercept, but the small bomb load and limited numbers meant it had minimal strategic impact. The type was also tested as a night fighter (Ar 234C-3/N) but this variant saw no combat. Like other advanced German aircraft, the Ar 234 arrived too late and in too few numbers to affect the war's outcome.

## Notable Features

- World's first operational jet bomber
- World's first operational jet reconnaissance aircraft
- Exceptional speed for immunity from interception
- Early prototypes used jettisonable takeoff dolly and landing skids
- Production aircraft had conventional tricycle landing gear
- RATO (rocket-assisted takeoff) capability for heavy loads
- Ejection seat in some variants
- Periscopic gunsight for rear-firing defensive guns
- Could outrun any Allied piston-engine fighter
- Autopilot system allowing pilot to operate bombsight
