## History

The Messerschmitt Me 323 Gigant was the largest land-based transport aircraft of World War II, developed from the Me 321 assault glider by adding six engines. The original Me 321 glider required three Bf 110s or a specially-developed He 111Z to tow it, a complex and dangerous operation. The powered Me 323 variant eliminated this limitation, creating a self-sufficient heavy transport capable of carrying entire vehicles and massive cargo loads.

The Me 323's construction was primarily wood and fabric over a steel tube frame to conserve strategic materials, with only critical areas using metal stressed-skin construction. This gave it enormous internal volume but made it structurally vulnerable. The cargo hold, accessed through massive clamshell doors in the nose, could accommodate a Panzer IV tank, 88mm flak gun with tractor, or 130 fully-equipped troops - loads impossible for any other German transport.

Me 323s saw extensive service supplying Axis forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Eastern Front from 1942-1944. However, the giant transports were terribly vulnerable to fighter attack - slow, cumbersome, and flammable. The most infamous loss occurred on 22 April 1943 when Allied fighters massacred a formation of Me 323s carrying fuel to Tunisia, shooting down 14 out of 16 aircraft in what became known as the "Palm Sunday Massacre." Despite heavy defensive armament added to later variants, the Me 323 remained a death trap when caught by fighters. Production ended in 1944 after about 213 aircraft, with surviving examples serving until Germany's surrender.
