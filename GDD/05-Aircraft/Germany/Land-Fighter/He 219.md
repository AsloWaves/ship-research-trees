## History

The Heinkel He 219 Uhu was Germany's most advanced and effective dedicated night fighter of World War II, featuring innovations that were years ahead of its time. Designed specifically for the night fighter role from the outset, it incorporated features like tricycle landing gear, ejection seats, and advanced avionics that made it superior to improvised night fighter conversions of day fighters and bombers.

The He 219 was equipped with FuG 212 or FuG 220 Lichtenstein radar systems that allowed crews to locate RAF bombers in darkness. The aircraft's heavy armament - typically six 30mm and 20mm cannons - could shred a bomber in a single pass. On its combat debut in June 1943, Major Werner Streib shot down five RAF bombers in a single night, demonstrating the type's devastating potential. He 219 pilots achieved remarkable success against the RAF's night bombing campaign, with some sources crediting the type with over 100 Mosquito kills - the RAF's fastest bomber was otherwise nearly impossible to intercept.

Despite its excellence, the He 219 suffered from production problems and political opposition. Ernst Heinkel had fallen out of favor with the Nazi leadership, and Erhard Milch actively worked to cancel the program in favor of simpler designs. Only about 300 were built, far fewer than needed. Those that served equipped specialist night fighter units (Nachtjagdgeschwader) and proved highly effective, but chronic shortages meant most night fighter squadrons flew obsolescent Bf 110s and Ju 88s instead. Had the He 219 been produced in larger numbers, it could have significantly impacted the Allied bomber offensive.

## Notable Features
