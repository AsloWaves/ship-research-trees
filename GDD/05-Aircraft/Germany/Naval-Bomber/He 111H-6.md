## History

The He 111H-6 was the primary torpedo bomber variant of Germany's most important medium bomber. Developed in 1941-42, it was specifically designed for anti-shipping operations and became the Luftwaffe's most capable torpedo bomber of World War II. The H-6 featured strengthened external hardpoints capable of carrying two LT F5b aerial torpedoes or a variety of external bomb loads.

This variant saw extensive service in anti-shipping operations across all theaters, but particularly in the Arctic convoys, Mediterranean, and Atlantic. He 111H-6 units achieved notable successes against Allied convoys, including attacks on the ill-fated PQ-17 convoy to Murmansk in July 1942. The aircraft's ability to carry two torpedoes made it particularly effective in coordinated strikes.

The H-6 also introduced improved defensive armament compared to earlier variants, with a 20mm cannon in the nose and better coverage from dorsal and ventral positions. Despite these improvements, losses to Allied fighters remained high, especially as Allied air superiority increased. By 1944, many H-6s were relegated to maritime reconnaissance and transport duties, though some continued torpedo operations until the war's end.

## Notable Features
