## History

The Me 410 Hornisse was developed as a successor to the problematic Me 210, correcting the earlier aircraft's severe stability and handling issues. The improvements included automatic leading-edge slats, lengthened fuselage, and revised engine nacelles. The result was a fast, heavily-armed heavy fighter that proved far more successful than its predecessor, though it never fully escaped the Me 210's tainted reputation.

The Me 410 entered service in early 1943 and was deployed in multiple roles: heavy fighter, bomber destroyer (Zerstörer), reconnaissance, and fast bomber. The type's high speed made it effective as a reconnaissance platform and hit-and-run bomber, conducting nuisance raids on Britain in 1943-1944. As a bomber destroyer, Me 410s equipped with heavy cannons (including the massive 50mm BK 5) achieved some success against Allied bomber formations, but suffered heavy losses to escort fighters.

The Me 410's remote-controlled defensive barbettes were an innovative feature, allowing the rear gunner to operate 13mm machine guns mounted in the rear fuselage sides via periscopic sights. However, these proved difficult to aim effectively in combat. By late 1944, the Me 410 was increasingly relegated to ground attack and night fighter roles as Allied air superiority made daylight operations suicidal. The type's high performance and heavy armament made it dangerous when conditions allowed, but it appeared too late and in insufficient numbers to significantly impact the war. Production ended in September 1944 after approximately 1,160 aircraft.

## Notable Features
