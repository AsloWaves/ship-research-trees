## History

The Bf 109T-2 was a modified version of the Bf 109T carrier fighter, adapted for land-based operations after the Graf Zeppelin carrier project was suspended in 1940. The original Bf 109T-0 and T-1 variants featured folding wings, arrester hook, and other navalizations, but when carrier operations became unlikely, the T-2 variant was developed.

The T-2 removed the folding wing mechanism and arrester hook, though it retained the strengthened landing gear and extended wingspan of the carrier variant. This gave it better low-speed handling characteristics compared to standard Bf 109E variants, making it suitable for operations from small or rough airfields. The aircraft also featured manually-operated leading-edge slats for improved low-speed performance.

Most Bf 109T-2s were deployed to Norway and assigned to coastal defense units, particularly in northern Norway where the improved low-speed handling was valuable for operations from short, rough airstrips. Some aircraft were also used for training purposes. The type saw limited combat action, primarily against Soviet aircraft in the Arctic theater, but was largely superseded by more modern Bf 109 variants by 1943.

## Notable Features

- Extended wingspan compared to standard Bf 109E (11.08m vs 9.87m)
- Reinforced landing gear designed for carrier deck operations
- Excellent low-speed handling characteristics
- Manually-operated leading-edge slats
- Modified for rough-field operations
- Retained naval-style flotation equipment in some examples
