## History

The Me 155B represented a significant redesign of the original Messerschmitt Me 155 carrier fighter program. When the Kriegsmarine's aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin project was revived in late 1942, work on the Me 155 was transferred from Messerschmitt to Blohm & Voss in early 1943. The naval shipbuilder had more experience with naval aircraft requirements and undertook a comprehensive redesign.

The B variant featured reinforced landing gear, an arrester hook, folding wings, and significant structural strengthening for carrier operations. Unlike the earlier Me 155A which was essentially a navalised Bf 109, the Me 155B was a substantially new design optimized for high-altitude performance and carrier operations. However, the programme became increasingly irrelevant as Germany's carrier ambitions collapsed and the emphasis shifted to defending the Reich from high-altitude bombers.

By 1944, the project was officially terminated as Germany abandoned its carrier program entirely. The design work contributed to the development of the high-altitude Blohm & Voss Bv 155, which was redesigned as a land-based interceptor. No Me 155B was ever completed or flown.
