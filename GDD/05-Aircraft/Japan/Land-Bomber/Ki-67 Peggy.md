## Notes

The Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryu represented the culmination of Japanese Army air force bomber design, developed initially as a successor to the Ki-49 with potential applications against Soviet forces in Manchuria. Originally designated as a heavy bomber, the Ki-67 actually fell into the medium bomber category when compared to contemporary American aircraft. Development commenced in 1941, and the first prototype conducted its maiden flight in December 1942. The aircraft incorporated several advanced features uncommon in Japanese military aviation of the era, including self-sealing fuel tanks and crew armor protection, enhancing crew survivability. Production delays and the demands of wartime manufacturing limited initial output, with significant production not commencing until 1944.

The Ki-67 made its operational debut in October 1944 as a torpedo bomber during the intense aerial and naval battles off the coast of Formosa (Taiwan). The aircraft subsequently saw combat in the Japanese counteroffensive at Iwo Jima and the Marianas, and participated in defense operations during the American landings at Okinawa. Despite its advanced design and superior performance characteristics—including impressive maneuverability, speed, and armament compared to contemporary Japanese bombers—the Ki-67 arrived too late to significantly impact the Pacific War. Approximately 698-767 aircraft were manufactured between 1942 and 1945, with production constantly hampered by Allied bombing raids against Japanese aircraft factories.

The Ki-67's combat record was limited by the deteriorating Japanese military situation in 1944-1945. Nevertheless, it earned respect from both Japanese and Allied aviation communities for its robust construction, reasonable defensive capabilities, and operational flexibility. Some aircraft were later converted into specialized variants, including the Ki-109 heavy fighter interceptor and the Ki-167 suicide aircraft, testament to the fundamental soundness of the airframe design. Though the Ki-67 never achieved the historical prominence of earlier Japanese bombers, it represented Japan's most advanced and capable bomber design of the WWII era, combining speed, protection, and firepower in a way no other Japanese bomber matched.
