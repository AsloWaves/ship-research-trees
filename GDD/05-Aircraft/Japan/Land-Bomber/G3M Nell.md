## Notes

The Mitsubishi G3M originated from a 1933-34 initiative by Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto seeking Japan's first modern land-based twin-engine naval bomber. The design evolved from the Ka-9 reconnaissance prototype (first flight April 1934) through the Ka-15 bomber variant (first flight July 1935), which entered production as the Type 96 G3M1 in June 1936. Mitsubishi prioritized long-range capability and speed over defensive armor, embodying Japan's naval aviation philosophy of striking enemy targets at distances beyond conventional fighter opposition. The aircraft became the embodiment of this doctrine until 1941, demonstrating the Japanese military's confidence in offensive power projection through extended range and altitude performance.

The G3M made its combat debut on August 14, 1937, during Japanese attacks on Shanghai and Nanking during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Initially suffering significant losses against Chinese opposition due to lack of fighter escort, the G3M subsequently dominated Chinese airspace and participated in extensive bombing campaigns. Its most significant achievement occurred on December 10, 1941, when 60 G3M2 aircraft from the Mihoro and Genzan Naval Air Corps participated in sinking the Royal Navy's battleship HMS Prince of Wales and battlecruiser HMS Repulse—the first capital ships actively defending themselves to be sunk solely by air power while in the open sea. The G3M served extensively in the Pacific War as both a torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, participating in operations from the Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942) through the war's end.

The G3M's design philosophy prioritized range and speed above all other considerations, making it one of the most formidable bombers of its era with a maximum range approaching 4,400 kilometers. However, this emphasis created a critical vulnerability: the aircraft lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and protective armor, earning it the grim nickname "one-shot lighter" or "flying lighter" from Allied fighter pilots who discovered that a single burst of gunfire could ignite the fuel system. From 1943 onward, most G3Ms were withdrawn from frontline bombing duties and converted to anti-submarine patrol, transport, and reconnaissance roles. Production continued until 1944, with a total of 1,048 aircraft manufactured by Mitsubishi and Nakajima. The G3M laid the groundwork for its more famous successor, the G4M Betty.
