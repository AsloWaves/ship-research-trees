## Notes

The Mitsubishi Ki-21 was developed in response to Japanese Army specifications issued in February 1936 for a modern heavy bomber. Following competitive selection, Mitsubishi and Nakajima were chosen to develop prototypes, with Mitsubishi's first prototype making its maiden flight on December 18, 1936. Powered by two Mitsubishi Ha-101 air-cooled radial engines producing 1,500 hp each, the aircraft entered service in 1939 and became the Japanese Imperial Army's principal heavy bomber throughout most of World War II, serving extensively in the Sino-Japanese War before expanding operations across the Pacific theater. Production ran through 1944, with 2,064 aircraft manufactured across all variants.

The Ki-21 demonstrated early promise but suffered from significant defensive vulnerabilities that became apparent during combat operations. When deployed over China, the 60th and 61st Sentai units experienced devastating losses. These limitations were brutally exposed in early encounters with Allied fighters; notably on December 23, 1941, twenty Ki-21s were shot down during raids on Rangoon at a cost of only two Allied pilots. The aircraft's inadequate defensive armor, limited armament, and relatively poor speed compared to contemporary Allied fighters made it increasingly vulnerable as the war progressed, resulting in unsustainable casualty rates for crews and the aircraft itself.

Despite the availability of the superior Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryu replacement, the lack of a timely alternative bomber meant that the Ki-21 remained in frontline service in large numbers well into 1944. The aircraft was produced in multiple variants from the Ki-21-Ia through Ki-21-IIb, with later models featuring the more powerful Mitsubishi Ha-101 engines and improved defensive turrets. By war's end, many remaining Ki-21s were converted for kamikaze suicide missions. The Ki-21 represented one of Japan's most heavily produced bomber aircraft and saw extensive combat throughout the Pacific War, despite its eventual obsolescence in the face of Allied air superiority.
