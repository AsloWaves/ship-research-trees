## Notes

The Nakajima G8N Renzan represented Japan's last and most sophisticated attempt to field a true strategic heavy bomber capable of matching American B-29 performance. In February 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy staff approached Nakajima with a demanding specification: a four-engine bomber capable of 370 mph while carrying an 8,800-lb bomb load 2,300 miles, or a reduced load an astonishing 4,600 miles. Nakajima's designers responded with an advanced aircraft featuring a high-aspect-ratio mid-mounted wing, tricycle landing gear, and powerful Nakajima NK9K-L Homare 24 18-cylinder radial engines producing 2,000 hp each, equipped with Hitachi 92 turbosuperchargers. The final specification was issued on September 14, 1943, and development began in earnest in January 1944.

The first prototype emerged from Nakajima's Koizumi plant in October 1944 and made its maiden flight on October 23rd. Three additional prototypes followed by June 1945. Flight testing revealed that, aside from minor turbosupercharger issues, the Renzan performed satisfactorily and even impressively, meeting most of its ambitious design goals. The remotely-operated defensive armament represented cutting-edge technology for Japanese aviation, and the tricycle landing gear provided excellent ground handling characteristics. The Navy, encouraged by the results, planned to complete 16 prototypes and 48 production G8N1 aircraft by September 1945, with a proposed G8N2 variant featuring even more powerful Mitsubishi MK9A engines (2,200 hp).

However, Japan's deteriorating war situation and a critical shortage of light aluminum alloys forced cancellation of the program in June 1945. One prototype was destroyed on the ground by U.S. carrier aircraft, while another was shipped to the United States after the war for evaluation before being scrapped. The Renzan never saw operational combat service, making it one of history's great "what if" aircraft—a capable strategic bomber that arrived too late to influence the Pacific War's outcome. Had materials been available and production begun earlier, the G8N might have provided Japan with a genuine strategic bombing capability comparable to the B-29, though by 1944-45 Japan lacked both the resources and strategic situation to employ such a weapon effectively.
