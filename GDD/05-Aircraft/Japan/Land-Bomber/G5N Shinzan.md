## Notes

The Nakajima G5N Shinzan represented Japan's ambitious attempt to develop a four-engine strategic heavy bomber during the early stages of World War II. Recognizing their lack of experience with such large, complex aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy took the unusual step of purchasing the American Douglas DC-4E airliner prototype for $950,000 in 1939. The aircraft was shipped to Tokyo, where Nakajima engineers dismantled and studied it extensively to inform their bomber design. Powered by four Nakajima NK7A "Mamori 11" 14-cylinder radial engines producing 1,870 hp each, the G5N made its first flight on April 8, 1941, but immediately revealed serious deficiencies.

The Shinzan proved a disappointment from the outset. The aircraft suffered from excessive weight, unreliable Mamori engines, and overall design complexity that Japanese industry struggled to master. Performance was so poor that the project was quickly deemed a failure. In a desperate attempt to salvage the program, two additional airframes were fitted with Mitsubishi Kasei engines and redesignated G5N2, but these proved even more underpowered than the originals. By 1943, the Navy abandoned any hope of using the type as a bomber. Four of the six completed aircraft were converted to G5N2-L transports and assigned to the 1021st Kōkūtai at Katori Air Base, where they served in long-range transport roles for the remainder of the war.

The Allies, who codenamed it "Liz," ironically expected Japan to develop a bomber from the DC-4E design, never knowing that the attempt had already failed spectacularly. The G5N's failure highlighted the enormous industrial and engineering gap between Japan and the United States in four-engine aircraft development. While the Americans successfully produced thousands of B-17s, B-24s, and B-29s, Japan could only manage six problematic examples of their Douglas-inspired heavy bomber. The Shinzan remained a footnote in aviation history—a cautionary tale about the challenges of reverse-engineering complex technology without the industrial base to support it.
