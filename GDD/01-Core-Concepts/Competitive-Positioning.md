# Competitive Positioning

## Overview
This document analyzes Fathoms Deep's competitive positioning in the naval combat and extraction shooter markets, identifying how we differentiate from major competitors and the unique market gap we fill.

## Implementation Status
**Status**: 📋 PLANNED - Market positioning strategy
**Phase**: Vision/Foundation
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for marketing and design differentiation

---

## Market Gap Analysis

### The Unfilled Niche
**No existing game combines:**
1. Tactical WWII naval combat
2. Extraction mechanics with permadeath stakes
3. Crew RPG progression systems
4. Massive-scale MMO persistence (300+ players)
5. Player-driven economy

**Why This Gap Exists:**
- **Naval games** focus on arcade action or match-based combat
- **Extraction shooters** lack naval settings and historical context
- **MMOs** rarely combine tactical combat with extraction mechanics
- **Tactical games** typically lack MMO persistence and scale

**Our Opportunity**: Create the definitive tactical naval extraction MMO that serves hardcore players seeking high-stakes WWII combat with meaningful progression and persistence.
