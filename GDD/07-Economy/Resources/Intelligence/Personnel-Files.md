## Lore

Personnel files represent the human side of naval intelligence - dossiers revealing who commands enemy vessels, their experience levels, decision-making patterns, and personal vulnerabilities. These files, captured from administration offices or intelligence services, contain service histories, training records, psychological evaluations, family information, and political affiliations. During WW2, knowing that a particular U-boat captain was aggressive and prone to taking risks versus another who was cautious affected Allied tactical decisions. Personnel intelligence also identifies recruitment targets - officers with financial troubles, political dissatisfaction, or family in Allied territories might be turned into double agents. Files reveal command relationships, showing which officers trust each other and which harbor rivalries. For players, personnel files provide context for enemy behavior and enable more sophisticated intelligence operations, including targeted recruitment of defectors and identification of incompetent commanders whose forces can be more easily defeated.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Administrative raids | Enemy naval headquarters | High | 3-5 |
| Captured from vessels | Enemy ships with personnel records | Medium | 1-2 |
| Espionage operations | Intelligence agencies | Very High | 5-10 |
| Defector information | Turned enemy personnel | Medium | 2-3 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with other intelligence to create Target Profiles
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Study files to reveal enemy commander traits and behaviors
- **Trade**: Moderate demand from intelligence services and psychological warfare units

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Personnel Files (10) | Intelligence Analysis | Commander Profiles | Intelligence Office |
| Personnel Files (5) | Recruitment Analysis | Defection Opportunity Reports | Counter-Intelligence |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~758 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher at intelligence headquarters and counter-intelligence offices |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy personnel administration (captured/stolen)
- **Major Consumers**: Counter-intelligence, psychological warfare, recruitment operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires successful raids or espionage, needs translation/analysis

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Personnel files provide softer intelligence about enemy human factors rather than direct tactical advantage. They enable sophisticated operations like targeted recruitment of defectors, psychological warfare campaigns, and prediction of enemy command decisions based on personality profiles. Players can identify enemy commanders with specific traits (aggressive, cautious, innovative) and adjust tactics accordingly. Uncommon rarity reflects moderate availability - personnel records exist widely but require targeted collection efforts to acquire in useful quantities.
