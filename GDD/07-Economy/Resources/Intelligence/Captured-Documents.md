## Lore

The catch-all category for enemy intelligence materials - captured documents span operation orders, logistics requisitions, fuel consumption reports, maintenance logs, diplomatic correspondence, and countless other papers that collectively reveal enemy capabilities and intentions. While less immediately valuable than specific intelligence like code books or patrol schedules, captured documents often contain unexpected treasures: a logistics report showing fuel shortages, diplomatic cables revealing alliance tensions, or maintenance logs indicating mechanical reliability problems. During WW2, mundane documents like requisition forms helped analysts track enemy supply chains, while personal letters revealed morale problems. The intelligence value often emerges only after extensive analysis - a fuel requisition from six months ago might seem worthless until combined with current convoy manifests to predict fleet operations. Players can sell captured documents for modest sums or invest time in analysis hoping for valuable intelligence breakthroughs. The variety and unpredictability of captured documents makes them interesting resources - you never know what might be lurking in a stack of enemy paperwork.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1515 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (steady utility) |
| **Regional Variance** | Slightly higher at intelligence centers with analysis capability |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy forces (captured materials)
- **Major Consumers**: Intelligence analysts, research departments

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Captured documents serve as the "mystery box" of intelligence resources - their value uncertain until analyzed. Players can accumulate documents from routine captures and either sell them for modest profits or invest in analysis hoping for valuable intelligence breakthroughs. The processing system creates interesting gameplay - do you sell 10 documents for safe credits, or process them for a chance at rare intelligence items? Rare rarity reflects their gameplay role as common loot that becomes valuable through processing rather than immediate use.
