## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Detailed architectural and defensive plans for enemy naval bases, showing harbor layouts, dry docks, fuel depots, defensive positions, and access routes. Critical intelligence for planning raids, bombardments, and amphibious assaults.

## Lore

Harbor plans are prized intelligence assets that reveal the inner workings of enemy naval facilities - information worth its weight in gold to attacking forces. These blueprints show dock locations, channel depths, defensive gun emplacements, fuel storage tanks, ammunition magazines, repair facilities, and underwater obstacles. With accurate harbor plans, attacking forces can strike high-value targets with precision while avoiding defensive strong points. The famous Raid on Taranto and Pearl Harbor attacks both relied heavily on detailed harbor intelligence. Plans also reveal vulnerabilities: undefended approach angles, fuel depot locations for incendiary attacks, dry docks for sabotage targets. Japanese submarine pens at Truk, British naval facilities at Scapa Flow, and American bases across the Pacific all had plans that became targets for enemy intelligence services. Harbor engineers, port authorities, and construction firms maintain these plans, making them available to covert operatives and spies.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Espionage missions | Enemy port facilities | High | 1 |
| Captured from engineers | Harbor construction sites | Medium | 1-2 |
| Harbor office raids | Port administration buildings | Very High | 2-3 |
| Defector intelligence | Recruited informants | Medium | 1 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Aerial Photographs to create Target Strike Packages
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Use to unlock detailed harbor information for naval bombardment/raid missions
- **Trade**: High demand from carrier groups and amphibious task forces

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Harbor Plans (2) + Aerial Photographs (5) | Target Analysis | Strike Mission Packages | Operations Planning |
| Harbor Plans (1) + Minefield Charts (1) | Combined Analysis | Safe Harbor Approach Routes | Intelligence Center |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1530 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | Premium near strategic harbors and invasion targets |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy port engineers, harbor authorities (via espionage)
- **Major Consumers**: Carrier strike groups, shore bombardment forces, commando units
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires successful espionage or capture operations, updates when harbors are modified

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Harbor plans provide tactical advantages for offensive naval operations against fixed installations. Players with accurate plans can target critical infrastructure (fuel depots, ammunition stores, dry docks) while avoiding heavily-defended areas. Plans reveal optimal attack vectors, enabling precision strikes that maximize damage while minimizing exposure to defensive fire. Particularly valuable for carrier-based air strikes, submarine penetrations, and commando raids. Rare rarity reflects the specialized nature of these documents and the espionage operations required to obtain them.
