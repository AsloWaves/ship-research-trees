## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Reconnaissance photographs of enemy installations, harbors, airfields, and fleet anchorages taken from aircraft. Provides current visual intelligence for target identification and strike planning.

## Lore

Aerial reconnaissance photographs revolutionized naval intelligence during WW2, providing unprecedented visual confirmation of enemy activities. Photos taken by scout planes, carrier aircraft, or long-range reconnaissance reveal ship positions, base layouts, construction activities, and damage assessments. Unlike maps showing intended layouts, photographs show actual current conditions - which docks are occupied, which ships are present, which facilities are damaged. Photo interpreters study shadows, vessel dimensions, and equipment details to identify specific ships and assess capabilities. Famous examples include reconnaissance photos of Taranto Harbor before the British attack, and photos of Truk showing the Japanese fleet at anchor. For players, aerial photographs provide targeting intelligence - showing what's actually present rather than what might be there. Photos combine well with harbor plans to create complete strike packages, and multiple photos over time reveal patterns of activity and vulnerability windows.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Reconnaissance missions | Carrier/land-based aircraft | Medium | 3-5 |
| Intelligence center distribution | Allied photo reconnaissance units | Low | 2-4 |
| Mission rewards | Photo reconnaissance operations | Medium | 5-10 |
| Purchase | Intelligence markets | Low | 1-3 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Harbor Plans to create Strike Packages
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Study to reveal current enemy positions and facilities (48hr validity)
- **Trade**: High demand from strike planning and target selection units

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Aerial Photographs (5) + Harbor Plans (2) | Target Analysis | Strike Mission Packages | Operations Planning |
| Aerial Photographs (10) | Photo Intelligence Analysis | Enemy Activity Report | Photo Interpretation Unit |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~227 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium (degrades as situations change) |
| **Regional Variance** | Premium near active combat zones and pre-invasion areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Allied photo reconnaissance units, carrier air groups
- **Major Consumers**: Strike planners, bombardment forces, invasion coordinators
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires aerial access, weather-dependent, time-sensitive

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Aerial photographs provide current, visual intelligence that complements documentary intelligence. Photos show what's really there right now rather than what was planned or reported. Players use photos for target selection - identifying which ships are in port, which facilities are operational, which areas are defended. The 48hr validity reflects rapid changes in naval deployments. Uncommon rarity reflects regular aerial reconnaissance production but regional limitations - you need air superiority or long-range reconnaissance capability to generate photos.
