## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Cutting-edge American radar systems providing superior detection and fire control capabilities. Compact, reliable units featuring advanced magnetron technology and precision ranging for naval operations.

## Lore

American radar technology represents a quantum leap in naval warfare capabilities. While the British pioneered early radar development, U.S. manufacturers like RCA and Western Electric have refined the technology into compact, reliable systems suitable for shipboard installation. The SC air search radar can detect incoming aircraft formations at ranges exceeding 75 miles, while the SG surface search radar revolutionizes night combat and navigation in foul weather. Most crucially, the Mark 8 fire control radar enables accurate gunnery against targets beyond visual range—a capability that proved decisive at engagements like the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, where American ships engaged Japanese forces in total darkness with devastating accuracy. The technology remains highly classified, with security protocols requiring radar equipment to be destroyed before allowing capture. Each unit contains sensitive components that the Navy fears could accelerate enemy radar programs if obtained intact.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Military Contract | U.S. Naval Shipyards | High | 1-2 units |
| Lend-Lease Program | Allied Ports | Very High | 1 unit |
| Salvage Operation | Sunken U.S. Warships | Extreme | 1-3 units (often damaged) |
| Intelligence Acquisition | Classified Facilities | Extreme | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Advanced fire control systems, integrated air defense networks, electronic warfare suites, combat information centers
- **Construction**: Cruisers, battleships, carriers (essential for modern fleet units), destroyer upgrades, radar picket ships, coastal defense installations
- **Consumable**: Temporary tactical advantage (+40% detection range and +25% gunnery accuracy for 24 hours when equipped)
- **Trade**: Forbidden - classified military technology, automatic court-martial for unauthorized transfer, extreme black market value if found

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Advanced Electronics x3, Copper Wire x2, Precision Tools x1 | Radar Assembly | US Navy Radar x1 | Naval Electronics Workshop |
| US Navy Radar x1, Fire Control Computer x1 | Integration | Mark 8 Fire Control System | Shipyard Fitting Dock |
| US Navy Radar x2, Radio Equipment x1 | Network Configuration | Combat Information Center | Advanced Naval Base |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5833 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | U.S. Naval facilities: 5500-6000cr (restricted), Allied ports: 8000-10000cr (Lend-Lease), Black market: 15000-25000cr (if available) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (RCA, Western Electric, General Electric facilities), very limited British production of compatible systems
- **Major Consumers**: U.S. Navy fleet modernization program, Royal Navy (via Lend-Lease), critical Allied warships, radar picket destroyers
- **Bottlenecks**: Shortage of specialized vacuum tubes (magnetrons), skilled technician training pipeline, security clearance requirements, competing priorities with Army Air Force radar needs

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

U.S. Navy radar represents one of the decisive technological advantages of the Allied naval effort. Ships equipped with modern radar systems can fight effectively in conditions that render enemy vessels blind—night, fog, rain, or smoke. The fire control applications enable beyond-visual-range gunnery that fundamentally changes naval tactics, while air search radar provides early warning against kamikaze attacks and conventional air strikes. The mere presence of radar-equipped ships in a task force multiplies the combat effectiveness of the entire formation. This technology gap is so significant that Axis intelligence services have standing orders to obtain American radar equipment by any means necessary, while the U.S. Navy maintains elaborate security measures to prevent compromise.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Uncommon | Base | Restricted to authorized naval vessels, security clearance required |
| United Kingdom | Rare | +50% | Limited Lend-Lease allocation, priority vessels only |
| Japan | Illegal | N/A | Enemy technology - intelligence windfall if captured intact |
| Germany | Illegal | N/A | Enemy technology - highest intelligence priority for Kriegsmarine |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - Powerful but appropriately rare and expensive, reflects historical impact
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced stack limit from 5 to 3 to emphasize scarcity; increased base value from 5000cr to 5833cr; added security clearance restrictions
- **Known Issues**: May create balance issues in PvP if one faction gains radar advantage - consider "radar jamming" countermeasures; monitor Lend-Lease availability to prevent Allied faction flooding
