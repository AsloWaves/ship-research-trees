## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Revolutionary radio proximity fuzes that detonate anti-aircraft shells near targets without direct hits. One of the most closely guarded secrets of the war, dramatically improving defensive firepower against enemy aircraft.

## Lore

The VT (Variable Time) proximity fuze represents a breakthrough so significant that it was considered second only to the atomic bomb in wartime secrecy. Developed through collaboration between the National Defense Research Committee and private manufacturers, these miniaturized radio transceivers fit inside the nose of a 5-inch anti-aircraft shell and detect when passing near an aircraft, triggering detonation at optimal range. Traditional time-fuzed or contact-fuzed AA shells required direct hits or precise timing calculations—VT fuzes increase effective hit probability by over 500%. Early in their deployment, strict protocols prevented their use over land where duds might be recovered and reverse-engineered by enemy forces. The fuzes were first employed during the 1943 Solomon Islands campaign, where Japanese pilots reported flying through seemingly impassable walls of exploding flak. Security surrounding VT fuzes remains absolute—even damaged units must be recovered or destroyed, and their very existence is denied in official communications that might be intercepted.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Military Allocation | U.S. Naval Arsenals | Very High | 2-5 units |
| Emergency Requisition | Fleet Supply Ships | Extreme | 1-3 units |
| Recovery Operation | Failed AA Shells | Extreme | 1 unit (damaged) |
| Black Market | None | Impossible | N/A (no supply exists) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: VT-fuzed 5-inch AA ammunition, proximity-detonated rocket warheads, advanced flak systems
- **Construction**: Upgraded anti-aircraft batteries on destroyers/cruisers/battleships/carriers, coastal defense AA installations
- **Consumable**: Load VT rounds into AA guns (+150% effectiveness vs. aircraft for duration of engagement, -75% ammunition consumption due to higher hit rate)
- **Trade**: Absolutely forbidden - possession by unauthorized personnel is treason, no black market due to extreme security, instant court-martial and investigation

### Processing & Refinement

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2750 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | U.S. Military only: 2500-3000cr (highly restricted), Allied forces: Not available (security risk), Black market: Non-existent (impossible to divert) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States only (handful of secure facilities with TOP SECRET clearance), no Allied production permitted
- **Major Consumers**: U.S. Pacific Fleet (kamikaze defense priority), U.S. Atlantic Fleet (submarine-launched air raid defense), critical carrier task forces
- **Bottlenecks**: Miniature vacuum tube production, extreme security vetting of manufacturing personnel, quality control failures (must be 100% reliable), competing Army demands for land-based AA

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

VT proximity fuzes represent a paradigm shift in anti-aircraft warfare. Before their introduction, ships expended thousands of rounds to down a single enemy aircraft; with VT fuzes, the same guns achieved multiple kills with dozens of rounds. This effectiveness proved critical against Japanese kamikaze attacks, where ships had mere seconds to destroy incoming suicide aircraft. The technology's sensitivity is such that even the British—America's closest ally—were initially denied access to prevent any possibility of compromise. A single intact VT fuze recovered by Axis forces could potentially allow them to develop countermeasures or duplicate the technology, negating years of Allied advantage. Intelligence reports indicate both Germany and Japan have standing bounties equivalent to millions of dollars for anyone who can deliver an intact VT fuze.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Very Rare | Base | TOP SECRET clearance required, usage tracked and accounted for, recovery protocols mandatory |
| United Kingdom | None | N/A | Denied access due to security concerns (until very late war, limited circumstances) |
| Japan | Illegal | N/A | Ultimate intelligence prize - captured examples trigger immediate analysis and countermeasure programs |
| Germany | Illegal | N/A | Kriegsmarine offers extraordinary rewards for intact specimens - highest technical intelligence priority |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - Extremely powerful but justified by historical impact and extreme scarcity/security restrictions
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced stack limit from 10 to 5 to reflect rarity; implemented mandatory tracking system for accountability; increased consumable bonus from +100% to +150% AA effectiveness to match historical performance
- **Known Issues**: Must ensure VT fuzes don't become commonly available or game-breaking in PvP; consider special "espionage" missions where enemy factions attempt to steal them; implement severe faction reputation penalties for unauthorized possession; consider mechanics for "dud recovery" by Axis players as rare intelligence coups
