## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Premium-grade structural steel from the legendary Krupp foundries. Superior tensile strength and weld consistency make it ideal for demanding shipbuilding applications.

## Lore

For over a century, the Krupp name has been synonymous with German industrial excellence. While Krupp Cemented Armor protects the most critical areas of warships, Krupp structural steel forms the backbone of German naval construction—from keel plates to bulkheads, from engine mounts to deck reinforcements. Produced in the massive Essen foundries using proprietary metallurgical processes, this steel offers consistent quality that German shipwrights trust implicitly. The alloy composition and forging techniques remain closely guarded secrets, though Allied metallurgists have analyzed captured German vessels and confirmed measurably superior grain structure and fatigue resistance compared to standard naval steel. Every ton of Krupp steel represents the industrial might that allows Germany to build warships faster and more reliably than nations dependent on variable-quality domestic steel.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Krupp Foundries (Essen) | Low | 5-15 units |
| Military Contract | German Naval Yards | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Convoy Interception | North Sea Routes | High | 3-8 units |
| Black Market | Neutral Ports | Medium | 1-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: U-boat Components, high-grade hull sections, reinforced deck plating, precision machinery components
- **Construction**: All German warship classes, submarine pens, fortified naval bases, dry dock facilities, gun turret foundations
- **Consumable**: Field repairs on damaged ships (+15% structural integrity restoration over standard steel)
- **Trade**: High demand from Axis navies, moderate demand from neutral nations, restricted in Allied territories

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Iron Ore x3, Coal x2, Manganese x1 | Krupp Process Smelting | Krupp Steel x5 | Krupp Foundry |
| Krupp Steel x3, Advanced Electronics x2 | Precision Manufacturing | U-boat Components x1 | Naval Workshop |
| Krupp Steel x5, Chromium x2 | Alloying Process | Premium Hull Plating x3 | Industrial Forge |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~133 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | German ports: 120-140cr, Axis ports: 150-180cr, Neutral ports: 200-250cr, Allied ports: 300cr+ (if not restricted) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Essen, Ruhr Valley foundries), limited licensed production in occupied territories
- **Major Consumers**: Kriegsmarine shipyards, Wehrmacht vehicle production, civilian infrastructure projects, Axis export orders
- **Bottlenecks**: Raw material shortages (iron ore, manganese), Allied bombing campaigns targeting Ruhr industrial complex, transportation constraints

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Krupp steel serves as the foundation of German industrial-military power. While not as rare as specialized components, its consistent quality provides German naval construction with a significant advantage in build speed and reliability. Ships built with Krupp steel frames require less rework and exhibit better long-term durability under combat stress. The material's reputation means German-built vessels command premium prices on international markets, even among nations nominally opposed to the Reich. Control of Krupp production facilities represents a high-value strategic bombing target for Allied air forces.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - Provides German players with quality advantage without being overpowered
- **Adjustment History**: Adjusted base value from 100cr to 133cr to reflect premium quality; increased stack limit to 15 for bulk construction projects
- **Known Issues**: Monitor price differential between factions - German players may exploit arbitrage opportunities in neutral ports
