## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Pure oxygen fuel for the legendary Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo. Enables unprecedented range and speed but extremely volatile and dangerous to handle.

---

## Lore

The Type 93 oxygen torpedo revolutionized naval warfare with its pure oxygen propulsion system, achieving 40+ knot speeds at ranges exceeding 20 miles - performance Allied torpedoes couldn't match until late war. The oxygen fuel itself is the critical component, requiring specialized production, storage, and handling facilities. Pure oxygen is extraordinarily dangerous - the slightest contamination or spark can cause catastrophic explosions, as demonstrated by tragic accidents aboard Japanese cruisers. Despite the risks, the combat advantages proved decisive in early Pacific night battles. Allied intelligence desperately sought oxygen torpedo technology, while Japanese forces guarded production facilities zealously. Salvaged oxygen fuel commands premium prices for its use in Long Lance torpedoes, though handling it requires specialized skills and courage.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Japanese cruiser/destroyer wrecks | Very Hard (explosive risk) | 3-8 units |
| Purchase | Japanese naval bases | N/A | Restricted availability |
| Capture | Japanese oxygen production facilities | Extreme | 10-20 units |
| Raid | Japanese supply depots | Hard | 5-10 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes, advanced oxygen torpedo variants
- **Construction**: Oxygen torpedo systems on IJN cruisers/destroyers, specialized submarine torpedoes
- **Consumable**: Consumed when firing oxygen torpedoes; explosion risk if ship takes damage while carrying
- **Trade**: Heavily regulated, black market extreme value, Allied intelligence pays premiums for samples

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Type 93 Oxygen x2, Torpedo Body x1, Warhead x1 | Assembly | Type 93 Long Lance Torpedo | Japanese Naval Arsenal |
| Type 93 Oxygen x1 | Intelligence Analysis | 2000+ credits + Intelligence Data | Allied Research Facility |
| Raw Materials x10, Energy x5 | Production | Type 93 Oxygen x3 | Oxygen Production Plant (Japanese only) |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~562 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | Pacific theater +50%, Allied markets +300%, late-war Japan +200% (production disruption) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Japan (exclusive oxygen production facilities)
- **Major Consumers**: IJN surface fleet, submarine forces, Allied intelligence/research programs
- **Bottlenecks**: Specialized production equipment, extreme safety requirements, storage/transport limitations

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Type 93 oxygen fuel enables the most devastating torpedoes in the Pacific theater. Long Lance-equipped Japanese surface forces can engage at ranges Allied ships cannot match, often deciding battles before enemies close to effective range. The fuel's scarcity makes each torpedo precious - experienced Japanese players manage oxygen supplies carefully, balancing combat effectiveness against irreplaceable ammunition. Allied players who capture oxygen fuel face difficult decisions: sell for enormous profit, study for intelligence value, or risk attempting to weaponize it despite lacking proper handling expertise. The volatility creates genuine tension - ship damage while carrying oxygen risks catastrophic secondary explosions.
