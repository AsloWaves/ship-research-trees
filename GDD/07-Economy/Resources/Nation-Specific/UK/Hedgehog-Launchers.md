## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Revolutionary British forward-throwing anti-submarine mortar system. Launches contact-fused projectiles ahead of the attacking vessel, maintaining sonar contact throughout the attack.

## Lore

The Hedgehog represents a quantum leap in anti-submarine weaponry. Traditional depth charges required escort vessels to pass over the submarine's last known position, losing sonar contact during the critical attack phase. Hedgehog fires 24 contact-fused projectiles forward in an elliptical pattern while maintaining ASDIC contact, dramatically improving kill probability. A single hit can destroy a submarine, while misses don't detonate to alert the target. British development began in 1941, and by 1943, Hedgehog-equipped escorts were devastating U-boat wolfpacks. The system is bulky and deck-intensive, limiting installation to larger escorts. Captured or salvaged Hedgehog launchers fetch astronomical prices from Allied navies desperate to upgrade their ASW capability.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | British destroyer/corvette wrecks | Extreme | 1 unit |
| Purchase | Major UK ports (highly restricted) | N/A | Special authorization only |
| Lend-Lease | High-tier Allied missions | Very Hard | 1 unit |
| Capture | Board and capture from active vessel | Extreme | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for advanced ASW weapon systems, forward-throwing mortar installations
- **Construction**: Destroyer/corvette ASW upgrades, dedicated submarine hunter configurations
- **Consumable**: Requires Hedgehog projectiles (separate ammunition resource) to function
- **Trade**: Extremely restricted, black market values exceed 50,000 credits, Allied nations queue for allocation

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Hedgehog Launcher x1, Mounting Hardware x1 | Installation | ASW Mortar System | British Naval Yard |
| Hedgehog Launcher x1, ASDIC Equipment x1 | Integration | Advanced ASW Suite | Specialized Facility |
| Damaged Hedgehog x1, Heavy Machinery x2 | Rebuild | Hedgehog Launcher x1 | Major Shipyard |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~7500 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | Atlantic theater +200%, Pacific theater +250%, unavailable in Axis markets except black market |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United Kingdom (exclusive), very limited Lend-Lease distribution
- **Major Consumers**: Royal Navy ASW escorts, US Navy destroyers (limited), Commonwealth navies
- **Bottlenecks**: Complex manufacturing, heavy weight/deck space requirements, security classification

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Hedgehog launchers represent the ultimate submarine killer. Ships equipped with Hedgehog-ASDIC combinations achieve kill rates 3-4x higher than depth charge-only vessels. The forward-throwing pattern means escorts can engage while maintaining full sonar contact and maneuvering capability. For players specializing in ASW operations, Hedgehog is essential equipment. The combination of extreme rarity, high cost, and devastating effectiveness makes Hedgehog installations status symbols among convoy escort commanders. Some naval groups organize entire tactical doctrines around Hedgehog-equipped flagship escorts.
