## Description

> *Glass fiber insulation and reinforcement material. Excellent thermal and electrical insulation in a lightweight package.*

---

## Lore

Fiberglass is glass transformed. Thin glass fibers woven together create an insulation material that's fireproof, rot-proof, and electrically non-conductive. It's lighter than asbestos and just as effective for most applications.

The material represents advanced manufacturing - drawing glass into impossibly thin fibers and weaving them into useful forms. Nations with fiberglass production can insulate electronics and equipment without depending on mineral sources. It's a mark of industrial sophistication.
