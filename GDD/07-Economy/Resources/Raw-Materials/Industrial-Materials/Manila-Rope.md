## Description

> *Premium natural fiber rope from abaca plants. Stronger than hemp and more resistant to saltwater degradation.*

---

## Lore

Manila rope is the king of natural cordage. Made from abaca fibers grown in the Philippines, it's stronger than hemp and resists saltwater rot better than any other natural rope. When a line absolutely cannot fail - mooring a ship in heavy weather, towing in combat - Manila is the choice.

The Philippines produce nearly all the world's abaca. Controlling these islands means controlling the best rope supply on Earth. Navies fighting in the Pacific prize Manila rope, knowing that inferior substitutes cost lives when lines part under strain.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -35% in Philippines, +30% Atlantic/Europe |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Philippines (nearly exclusive)
- **Major Consumers**: All navies (premium operations)
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme geographic concentration

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Premium cordage for critical applications
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Manila rope matters when failure is not an option. Regular operations can use hemp, but towing operations, heavy weather mooring, and critical lines deserve Manila's superior strength and durability.
