## Description

> *Heat-resistant mineral fiber for insulation and fireproofing. Essential for protecting crews from machinery heat and fire damage.*

## Lore

Asbestos is the guardian against fire. This fibrous mineral withstands temperatures that would melt steel, making it invaluable for insulating engine rooms, boiler spaces, and ammunition magazines. Without asbestos, the heat from a ship's own machinery would cook its crew.

Every warship carries asbestos in its walls, wrapped around pipes, layered in fire doors. It's the unseen shield between sailors and the infernal heat of a warship's engineering spaces. When battle damage starts fires, asbestos insulation buys precious minutes for damage control teams to save the ship.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Asbestos deposits | Easy | 15-30 units |
| Purchase | Any industrial port | Easy | Very cheap |
| Salvage | Ship engine rooms | Easy | 5-15 units |
| Trade | Mining regions | Easy | Bulk quantities |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Insulation panels, fire blankets, gaskets
- **Construction**: Engine room insulation, fire protection
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Steady industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Asbestos ×3 | Weaving | Asbestos Cloth ×2 | Textile Mill |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% near mines, +15% in Pacific islands |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Canada, South Africa, USSR mining regions
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Rarely constrained - widely available

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Fire protection essential
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Asbestos matters most during ship construction and repair. Combat ships without proper insulation suffer crew casualties from their own machinery. Adequate asbestos supply enables faster, safer shipbuilding.
