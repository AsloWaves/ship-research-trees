## Description

> *Early synthetic plastic for electrical insulation and equipment housings. The wonder material of the industrial age.*

---

## Lore

Bakelite was the first true plastic - a synthetic material that could be molded into any shape and held it forever. Heat-resistant, electrically insulating, and durable, it revolutionized manufacturing. Every radio dial, electrical switch, and equipment housing owes something to Bakelite.

The material comes from phenol and formaldehyde, transformed by heat and pressure into hard, glossy plastic. It can't be melted or reshaped once cured, but that permanence is its strength. Bakelite parts don't warp, don't conduct electricity, and last for decades.
