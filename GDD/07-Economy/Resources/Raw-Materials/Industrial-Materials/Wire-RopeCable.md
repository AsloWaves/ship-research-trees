## Description

> *Steel cable for heavy-duty applications. Stronger than any natural rope and immune to rot.*

---

## Lore

Wire rope is modern muscle. Braided steel cables can handle loads that would snap the thickest hemp in seconds. Every crane, winch, and heavy lift aboard a modern warship depends on wire rope to move guns, ammunition, and aircraft.

The cables never rot, never lose strength to moisture, and warn before they fail by fraying visibly. The tradeoff is weight and handling - wire rope is heavy and unforgiving, requiring specialized equipment to splice and maintain. Where strength matters most, wire rope is essential.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Steel mills/rope works | Medium | 4 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Medium | Premium price |
| Salvage | Heavy equipment | Medium | 2-5 units |
| Trade | Industrial suppliers | Medium | Standard availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Crane cables, winch lines, aircraft arrestor cables
- **Construction**: Heavy lift equipment, towing gear
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel Wire ×4 | Braiding | Wire Rope ×2 | Wire Works |
| Wire Rope ×2 + Fittings ×1 | Assembly | Crane Cable Set ×1 | Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~37 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at steel centers, +30% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Industrial nations with steel production
- **Major Consumers**: Heavy equipment operators, shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Steel quality, specialized manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for heavy equipment
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Wire rope enables heavy operations. Without it, aircraft can't be recovered on carriers, heavy cargo can't be loaded, and damaged ships can't be towed. It's the backbone of naval logistics and repair.
