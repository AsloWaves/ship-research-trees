## Description

> *Heavy fuel oil for large vessel propulsion. Thick, viscous, and cheap - the workhorse fuel that moves battleships and freighters across oceans.*

---

## Lore

Bunker fuel is the thick black sludge that moves fleets. It's not elegant - it has to be heated just to pump it, and it leaves a trail of smoke that any lookout can spot. But it's cheap, plentiful, and powerful enough to push a battleship at thirty knots.

Every major warship has bunkers deep in its hull where this fuel waits. The fuel gauges in the engine room tell officers how far they can steam, how long they can fight. Running low on bunker fuel means running home - or not running at all.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Refining | Oil refineries | Medium | 3 per 5 crude oil |
| Purchase | Major naval ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Capture | Enemy supply ships | Medium | 20-50 units |
| Salvage | Damaged oilers | Medium | 10-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: N/A (end product)
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Ship propulsion fuel (large vessels)
- **Trade**: Steady demand at all major ports

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Crude Oil ×5 | Fractional Distillation | Bunker Fuel ×3 + other products | Oil Refinery |
| Bunker Fuel ×3 | Cracking | Diesel ×2 | Advanced Refinery |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~14 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at refinery ports, +40% in remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Oil refineries at major ports
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ships, large transports, carriers
- **Bottlenecks**: Refinery capacity, tanker distribution

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for capital ship operations
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Bunker fuel availability determines operational range for battleships, carriers, and heavy cruisers. Forward refueling points are strategic assets. Fleets without bunker fuel access cannot project power beyond their immediate waters.
