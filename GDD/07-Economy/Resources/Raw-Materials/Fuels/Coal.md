## Description

> *Basic solid fuel for older ships and industrial processes. Cheap and abundant, but dirty and labor-intensive.*

---

## Lore

Coal built the navies that ruled before oil changed everything. Some older vessels still burn it, their black smoke marking their passage across the horizon. But coal's real value now lies in steel production and synthetic fuel plants, not propulsion.

Coaling a ship was backbreaking work - crews covered in black dust, shoveling tons of fuel into bunkers. The oil-burning fleet left that misery behind, but coal remains essential for the foundries that produce steel and the plants that synthesize fuel from it. Old fuel, new purposes.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Coal deposits | Easy | 20-40 units |
| Purchase | Any industrial port | Easy | Very cheap |
| Salvage | Coal-burning wrecks | Easy | 10-30 units |
| Trade | Neutral mining regions | Easy | Bulk quantities |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Steel production (blast furnaces), synthetic fuel
- **Construction**: Industrial facility fuel
- **Consumable**: ✅ Older ship propulsion, base heating
- **Trade**: Bulk commodity, universal industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Coal ×10 + Iron Ore ×5 | Smelting | Pig Iron ×4 + Slag | Blast Furnace |
| Coal ×5 + Steam ×3 | Fischer-Tropsch | Synthetic Fuel ×2 | Synfuel Plant |
| Coal ×3 | Coking | Coke ×2 | Coke Oven |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~4 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -40% near mines, +30% in Pacific islands |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Mining regions worldwide
- **Major Consumers**: Steel mills, synthetic fuel plants, older vessels
- **Bottlenecks**: Transportation bulk, storage space requirements

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Industrial support role
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Foundation of heavy industry
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Coal's military value is indirect - it makes the steel for ships and the synthetic fuel for engines. Cutting off coal supply doesn't stop a fleet immediately, but it slowly strangles the industrial base that sustains it.
