## Description

> *Medium-grade fuel for destroyers, submarines, and smaller vessels. Cleaner burning than bunker fuel with better power-to-weight ratio.*

---

## Lore

Diesel is the fuel of the hunters. Destroyers, submarines, and fast attack craft run on diesel, their engines built for speed and agility rather than raw endurance. The cleaner burn means less smoke - critical for submarines that need every second of invisibility.

The distinctive rumble of diesel engines is the sound of death approaching for many a merchant ship. Destroyers on diesel can chase down any quarry, and submarines on diesel power can position for the perfect shot. Where bunker fuel moves mountains, diesel stalks prey.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Refining | Oil refineries | Medium | 2 per 5 crude oil |
| Purchase | Most ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Capture | Enemy destroyers/subs | Medium | 10-30 units |
| Cracking | From bunker fuel | Medium | 2 per 3 bunker fuel |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: N/A (end product)
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Ship propulsion (destroyers, submarines, escorts)
- **Trade**: High demand from destroyer and submarine operators

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Crude Oil ×5 | Fractional Distillation | Diesel ×2 + other products | Oil Refinery |
| Bunker Fuel ×3 | Cracking | Diesel ×2 | Advanced Refinery |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~14 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at refineries, +30% at submarine bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Oil refineries
- **Major Consumers**: Destroyer squadrons, submarine flotillas, patrol craft
- **Bottlenecks**: Refinery cracking capacity, submarine operational tempo

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for escort and submarine operations
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Diesel availability determines escort strength and submarine patrol capability. Without diesel, convoys go undefended and submarine pens sit silent. The faction that controls diesel controls the small ship war.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | ×0.8 | Massive production capacity |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | ×1.0 | Prioritized for escort operations |
| Japan | Limited | ×1.4 | Submarine operations constrained |
| Germany | Limited | ×1.3 | U-boat priority, surface fleet secondary |
