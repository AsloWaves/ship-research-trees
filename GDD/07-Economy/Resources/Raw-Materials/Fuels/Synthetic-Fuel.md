## Description

> *Fuel produced from coal through chemical processes. Expensive and energy-intensive, but vital for nations without oil access.*

---

## Lore

Synthetic fuel is desperation refined into power. When the oil tankers stop coming and the wells run dry, coal-to-liquid plants become the difference between a fighting fleet and a rusting museum. The process consumes vast amounts of coal and energy to produce fuel - inefficient by any measure, but better than nothing.

The nations that invested in synthetic fuel technology did so out of necessity. Their plants run day and night, transforming mountains of coal into the liquid that keeps engines turning. It's not elegant, it's not economical, but it's survival.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Synthetic fuel plants | Hard | 2 per 5 coal + energy |
| Purchase | German/fuel-scarce ports | Medium | Premium price |
| Capture | Industrial facilities | Very Hard | 10-20 units |
| Research | Coal-to-liquid tech | Hard | Unlocks production |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: N/A (end product - fuel substitute)
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Ship propulsion (substitute for diesel/bunker fuel)
- **Trade**: High demand in oil-scarce regions

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Coal ×5 + Steam ×3 | Fischer-Tropsch | Synthetic Fuel ×2 | Synfuel Plant |
| Synthetic Fuel ×3 | Upgrading | Synthetic Diesel ×2 | Advanced Refinery |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~45 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at synfuel plants, +100% in Pacific theater |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Synthetic fuel plants (Germany primary, limited elsewhere)
- **Major Consumers**: Navies without oil access
- **Bottlenecks**: Energy requirements, plant construction, coal supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Critical for fuel-starved factions
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Synthetic fuel represents strategic independence from oil supplies. For nations facing blockade, synfuel plants are among the most critical industrial assets - destroy them and the enemy fleet stops moving.
