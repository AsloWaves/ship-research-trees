## Description

> *Premium aviation fuel with boosted octane rating for maximum engine performance. The difference between adequate and exceptional air power.*

---

## Lore

High-octane fuel is the elixir of air supremacy. Where standard aviation gasoline keeps planes flying, high-octane fuel makes them fly faster, climb higher, and fight harder. The difference in performance is measured in dogfights won and bombers that return home.

The process of creating high-octane fuel requires advanced additives and precise blending - capabilities only the most sophisticated refineries possess. Pilots assigned to squadrons with access to high-octane fuel know they've been given an edge their enemies lack. It's not just fuel, it's victory in liquid form.
