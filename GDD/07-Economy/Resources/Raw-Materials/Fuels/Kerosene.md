## Description

> *Versatile light fuel for lamps, stoves, and heating. Also serves as a base for more refined aviation fuels.*

---

## Lore

Kerosene is the workhorse fuel of any fleet - not glamorous, but utterly essential. It lights the lamps that illuminate chart rooms during night watches. It heats the galleys where cooks prepare meals for hundreds. It fires the portable stoves that keep crews warm in Arctic waters.

Beyond daily life, kerosene serves as feedstock for aviation fuel production. The same stuff that lights a sailor's reading lamp can be refined further into the fuel that powers fighter aircraft. Never underestimate the mundane - it keeps the fleet running.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Refining | Oil refineries | Easy | 3 per 5 crude oil |
| Purchase | Any port | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Ship wrecks | Easy | 5-15 units |
| Production | Basic distillation | Easy | 2 per 4 crude oil |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Aviation fuel base, lamp fuel
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Lighting, heating, cooking fuel
- **Trade**: Steady universal demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Crude Oil ×5 | Fractional Distillation | Kerosene ×3 + other products | Oil Refinery |
| Kerosene ×3 + Catalysts ×1 | Upgrading | Aviation Gasoline ×2 | Advanced Refinery |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~10 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at refineries, +20% in remote locations |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Oil refineries (byproduct of all distillation)
- **Major Consumers**: All vessels (lighting/heating), aviation fuel producers
- **Bottlenecks**: Generally abundant, rarely a constraint

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Support role only
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Kerosene matters most as feedstock for aviation fuel and for keeping crews comfortable. It's rarely a strategic bottleneck but always necessary. A ship without kerosene is a ship in the dark.
