## Description

> *Specialized oxidizer compound for torpedo propulsion. Extremely volatile and expensive - the fuel that makes torpedoes deadly.*

---

## Lore

Torpedo fuel is death in a bottle. The specialized oxidizer compounds that power torpedo engines are among the most dangerous substances carried aboard any warship. One leak, one spark, one careless moment - and the torpedo room becomes a crematorium.

The Japanese Long Lance torpedoes use pure oxygen as their oxidizer - more power, more range, but catastrophically dangerous. American and British torpedoes use less powerful but safer compounds. Either way, torpedo fuel requires expert handling and special storage. The men who work with torpedo fuel know they're one accident away from oblivion.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Torpedo facilities | Very Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major naval bases | Hard | Extremely expensive |
| Capture | Enemy torpedo stores | Very Hard | 3-8 units |
| Salvage | Torpedo wrecks | Very Hard | 1-2 units (dangerous) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Torpedo assembly, torpedo reload
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Powers torpedo attacks
- **Trade**: Extreme demand from submarine/destroyer operators

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Compressed Air ×3 + Kerosene ×2 | Processing | Standard Torpedo Fuel ×1 | Torpedo Workshop |
| Liquid Oxygen ×2 + Special Catalysts ×1 | Advanced Processing | Long Lance Fuel ×1 | Advanced Torpedo Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~240 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at torpedo depots, +100% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Specialized torpedo production facilities
- **Major Consumers**: Submarines, destroyers, torpedo boats
- **Bottlenecks**: Production facility rarity, safety requirements

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Enables torpedo warfare
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Torpedo fuel availability directly limits offensive torpedo capability. Without it, tubes sit empty and submarines become scouts rather than hunters. Control of torpedo fuel supply determines who dominates the underwater war.
