## Description

> *Precious metal with the highest electrical and thermal conductivity. Essential for premium electrical contacts and photographic film production.*

---

## Lore

Silver is the bridge between electricity and precision. Where current must flow without resistance, where contacts must close reliably every time, silver provides the assurance that copper cannot. In fire control circuits and detonator switches, silver ensures that orders translate into action.

The photography labs aboard carriers and at intelligence facilities consume silver in film after film after film. Every reconnaissance photo, every targeting image, every piece of photographic intelligence costs silver. The war's documentation is written in silver emulsion.
