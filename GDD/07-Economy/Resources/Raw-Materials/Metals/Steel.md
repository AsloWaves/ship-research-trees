## Description

> *Refined carbon steel ingots. The backbone of warship construction, used in everything from hull plating to machinery.*

---

## Lore

Steel ingots are the universal currency of naval power. Every captain knows the weight of steel in their holds represents potential - repairs that can be made, ammunition that can be forged, ships that can be built. The great foundries that dot industrial ports run day and night, their furnaces never cooling.

Veteran traders speak of the "steel runs" - dangerous convoy routes between mining regions and shipyards where fortunes are made and lives are lost. A single successful steel convoy can outfit an entire squadron.

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~12 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low-Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at steel mills, +25% at remote shipyards |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Industrial ports with steel mills
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, weapons factories, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Pig iron supply, coal availability, smelting capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Steel is the foundation of naval power. Without steady steel supplies, a faction cannot build new ships, repair battle damage, or manufacture ammunition. Control of steel production facilities is often the primary strategic objective in territorial disputes.
