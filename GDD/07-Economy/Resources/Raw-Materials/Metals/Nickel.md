## Description

> *Silvery-white metal essential for armor alloys and corrosion-resistant steel. Critical component in high-quality armor plate production.*

---

## Lore

Nickel is the hidden strength in armor plate. A shell that would punch through ordinary steel shatters against nickel-alloyed armor. Metallurgists guard their nickel formulas jealously, knowing that the right percentage can mean the difference between a ship that survives and one that dies.

The great nickel convoys from the northern mines are among the most heavily escorted in any fleet. Losing a nickel shipment doesn't just cost money - it costs the ability to protect future warships. Enemy submarines prowl these routes with particular dedication.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Nickel deposits (rare) | Medium | 8-15 units |
| Trading | Major industrial ports | Medium | Premium price |
| Salvage | Armor plate salvage | Hard | 2-5 units |
| Import | Northern mining regions | Easy | Convoy required |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Armor steel alloys, stainless steel, corrosion-resistant fittings
- **Construction**: Capital ship armor, critical structural components
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High value, strategic commodity

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×4 + Nickel ×1 + Chromium ×1 | Alloying | Armor Steel ×2 | Armor Mill |
| Steel ×2 + Nickel ×1 + Chromium ×1 | Alloying | Stainless Steel ×2 | Advanced Foundry |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~15 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% near mining regions, +50% at armor mills |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Northern nickel mines (limited locations)
- **Major Consumers**: Armor mills, advanced steel production
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration of deposits, convoy vulnerability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Nickel is the limiting factor in armor production for most factions. Without nickel, only inferior armor can be produced, leaving warships vulnerable. Control of nickel sources provides decisive strategic advantage in capital ship construction.
