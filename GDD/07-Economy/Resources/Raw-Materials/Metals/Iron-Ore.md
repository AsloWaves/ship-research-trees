## Description

> *Unrefined iron ore extracted from mines. The foundation of all steel production and the lifeblood of naval shipbuilding.*

---

## Lore

In the contested waters of Fathoms Deep, iron ore convoys are among the most frequently targeted. The great ore carriers that ply the northern routes carry the raw material that will become warship hulls, gun barrels, and engine blocks. Without iron, fleets cannot be built or repaired.

Mining outposts on remote islands have become strategic flashpoints. Factions establish forward bases near ore deposits, and control of these locations can shift the balance of naval power across entire regions.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Ore deposits on islands | Easy | 10-25 units |
| Salvage | Sunken cargo ships | Medium | 5-15 units |
| Trading | Major ports | Easy | Market price |
| Convoy capture | Ore transport routes | Hard | 50-200 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Smelted into Pig Iron, then refined into Steel and specialty alloys
- **Construction**: Not used directly - must be processed first
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High volume commodity, always in demand at industrial ports

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Iron Ore ×5 + Coal ×2 | Smelting | Pig Iron ×3 | Blast Furnace |
| Iron Ore ×10 | Direct Reduction | Scrap Iron ×8 | Basic Foundry |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~4 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% near mining regions, +30% in industrial zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Northern mining islands, mountainous coastal regions
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, weapons factories, industrial ports
- **Bottlenecks**: Shipping capacity, convoy security, smelting facilities

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Iron ore is abundant but heavy, making transport the primary challenge. Controlling ore shipping lanes provides enormous strategic advantage. A faction cut off from iron supplies will see its shipbuilding capacity collapse within weeks.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | ×0.8 | Domestic deposits, efficient mining |
| United Kingdom | Limited | ×1.2 | Relies on imports from Empire |
| Japan | Scarce | ×1.5 | Poor domestic ore, import dependent |
| Germany | Moderate | ×1.0 | Swedish ore access critical |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - abundant but transport-intensive
- **Adjustment History**: Base stack increased from 40 to 50 to reduce cargo micromanagement
- **Known Issues**: Consider increasing weight to 1.2t to make bulk transport more challenging
