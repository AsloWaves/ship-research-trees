## Description

> *Soft silvery metal essential for bronze alloys and tin plating. Also used for solder and corrosion-resistant coatings.*

---

## Lore

Tin may be soft, but its alloys are hard enough to bite through steel. Mixed with copper, it becomes bronze - the metal that keeps propellers spinning and bearings smooth. Coated on steel, it becomes the tin cans that keep sailors fed on long voyages.

The tin trade routes stretch across the world's most contested waters. The mines that produce it are prizes worth fighting over, and the convoys that carry it merit heavy escort. A tin shortage means bronze shortage, and bronze shortage means ships dead in the water.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Tin deposits | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Trading | Neutral ports, mining regions | Easy | Market price |
| Salvage | Bronze components | Medium | 3-8 units |
| Import | Southeast Asian routes | Hard | High volume available |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Bronze alloys, solder, tin plating for cans
- **Construction**: Corrosion-resistant coatings
- **Consumable**: Food preservation (cans)
- **Trade**: Steady demand from foundries

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% near mines, +50% in tin-scarce regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Southeast Asian mining regions, South American sources
- **Major Consumers**: Bronze foundries, canning facilities, electronics
- **Bottlenecks**: Shipping routes through contested waters

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Tin is the limiting factor in bronze production, which affects propeller and bearing manufacturing. Factions that control tin sources can constrain enemy fleet mobility over time.
