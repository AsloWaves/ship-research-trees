## Description

> *Brilliant silvery metal essential for stainless steel and armor alloys. Provides corrosion resistance and hardness to steel formulations.*

---

## Lore

Chromium turns ordinary steel into something that laughs at rust and shrugs off shells. The mirror-bright metal is deceptively beautiful - and desperately sought. Captains hauling chromium ore know they're carrying more than metal; they're carrying the future strength of the fleet.

The refineries that process chromium work with temperatures that can melt stone. The resulting chrome-steel alloys resist everything the sea and the enemy can throw at them. In a world of salt spray and shellfire, chromium is survival itself.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% near mining regions, +40% at industrial centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Limited mining regions, neutral territories
- **Major Consumers**: Armor mills, stainless steel production, weapons factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration, diplomatic access

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Chromium is essential for both armor production and corrosion-resistant applications. Without chromium, armor quality suffers and maintenance costs skyrocket as steel components rust. Control of chromium sources strongly influences capital ship construction capability.
