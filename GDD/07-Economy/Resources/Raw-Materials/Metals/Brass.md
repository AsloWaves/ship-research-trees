## Description

> *Copper-zinc alloy with excellent machinability. Used extensively for ammunition casings, fittings, and instrument components.*

## Lore

The golden gleam of brass is the gleam of firepower. Every shell that leaves a gun, every round in a magazine, started as brass ingots in some distant foundry. Ammunition factories consume brass by the ton, their presses stamping out the casings that feed the fleet's hungry weapons.

Smart captains collect their spent brass casings - they can be reloaded or recycled. In the economy of war, nothing is truly waste. The brass that fired at the enemy today might fire again tomorrow, reborn in a foundry's crucible.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Alloying | Foundries | Medium | Crafted |
| Trading | Industrial ports | Easy | Market price |
| Recycling | Spent casings | Easy | 3-8 units |
| Salvage | Shipwrecks | Medium | 5-12 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Ammunition casings, valve bodies, fittings, instrument parts
- **Construction**: Plumbing, electrical terminals, decorative elements
- **Consumable**: Ammunition production (expended in use)
- **Trade**: High volume demand from weapons factories

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper ×2 + Zinc ×1 | Alloying | Brass ×2 | Foundry |
| Brass ×3 | Drawing | Cartridge Brass ×5 | Ammunition Plant |
| Brass ×2 | Casting | Brass Fittings ×8 | Machine Shop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~11 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at foundries, +25% at ammunition factories |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Brass foundries, recycling operations
- **Major Consumers**: Ammunition factories, instrument makers, shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Zinc supply, ammunition demand spikes during combat

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Brass availability directly limits ammunition production. A faction running low on brass cannot sustain combat operations regardless of how many guns it possesses. Recycling spent casings becomes critical during extended campaigns.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | ×0.8 | Massive production capacity |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | ×1.0 | Adequate domestic supply |
| Japan | Limited | ×1.4 | Zinc shortage causes problems |
| Germany | Limited | ×1.3 | Recycling programs essential |
