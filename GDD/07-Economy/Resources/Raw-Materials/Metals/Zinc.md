## Description

> *Bluish-white metal used for galvanizing steel, making brass, and battery production. Essential for corrosion protection.*

## Lore

Zinc is the invisible protector. Steel looks the same with or without its zinc coating, but one rusts away in months while the other endures for years. Every ship that survives a long deployment owes something to the humble grey metal that shields its hull.

The galvanizing yards are strange places - vats of molten zinc hot enough to melt lesser metals, into which workers dip steel components. What emerges is transformed, protected against the sea's endless corrosion. In the war against rust, zinc is the ultimate weapon.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Zinc deposits | Easy | 12-25 units |
| Trading | Most ports | Easy | Market price |
| Salvage | Galvanized components | Easy | 5-10 units |
| Recycling | Spent batteries | Easy | 2-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Brass alloys, galvanizing coating, batteries
- **Construction**: Corrosion protection for steel
- **Consumable**: Battery production
- **Trade**: Steady industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper ×2 + Zinc ×1 | Alloying | Brass ×2 | Foundry |
| Zinc ×2 | Hot Dipping | Galvanizing Solution ×5 | Galvanizing Yard |
| Zinc ×3 + Carbon ×1 | Assembly | Dry Batteries ×4 | Battery Plant |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~9 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% near mines, +10% in industrial zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Mining regions across multiple continents
- **Major Consumers**: Galvanizing operations, brass foundries, battery manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Smelting capacity, sometimes competes with other ores for transport

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Zinc is abundant but essential. Without it, steel corrodes rapidly, brass production stalls, and batteries cannot be manufactured. Its importance lies in ubiquity rather than rarity.
