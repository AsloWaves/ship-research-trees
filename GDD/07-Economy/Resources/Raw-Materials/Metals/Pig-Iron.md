## Description

> *Crude iron ingots from the blast furnace. High carbon content makes it brittle - must be refined into steel for most applications.*

---

## Lore

The characteristic oblong shapes of pig iron ingots are the building blocks of naval power - crude and unusable in their current form, but full of potential. Blast furnaces consume iron ore and coal endlessly, their output stacking in yards like sleeping metal animals.

Captains carrying pig iron know they're transporting raw power. These dull grey ingots will become the keel of a destroyer, the barrel of a naval gun, the armor of a battleship. The journey from pig iron to finished steel is the journey from potential to reality.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Smelting | Blast furnaces | Medium | Crafted from ore |
| Trading | Industrial ports | Easy | Market price |
| Salvage | Iron foundries | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Recycling | From scrap iron | Easy | Lower efficiency |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Primary input for steel production
- **Construction**: Not suitable (too brittle)
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Industrial commodity, steady demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Iron Ore ×5 + Coal ×2 | Smelting | Pig Iron ×3 | Blast Furnace |
| Pig Iron ×3 + Coal ×1 | Refining | Steel ×2 | Steel Mill |
| Pig Iron ×5 | Casting | Cast Iron ×4 | Basic Foundry |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at blast furnaces, +15% at steel mills |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Blast furnace operations near mining regions
- **Major Consumers**: Steel mills, cast iron foundries
- **Bottlenecks**: Coal supply, blast furnace capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Pig iron is the critical intermediate product in the steel supply chain. Disrupting pig iron production or transport effectively halts steel manufacturing. Control of blast furnace facilities provides significant economic leverage.
