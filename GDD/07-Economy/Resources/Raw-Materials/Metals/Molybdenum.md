## Description

> *Refractory metal that dramatically improves steel strength and heat resistance. Essential for gun barrels, high-performance engine parts, and premium armor.*

---

## Lore

Molybdenum is the secret ingredient in steel that refuses to fail. Engineers speak of it with reverence - the element that keeps gun barrels from burning out, that lets engines run at temperatures that would melt lesser metals. A small percentage makes an enormous difference.

The molybdenum convoys from the great American mines are among the most vital shipments in the war. Without molybdenum, guns wear out faster, engines fail sooner, and armor cracks under stress that properly alloyed steel would shrug off. It's the margin between adequate and excellent.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Molybdenum deposits (very rare) | Hard | 3-8 units |
| Trading | Allied industrial ports | Medium | Premium price |
| Salvage | High-performance machinery | Very Hard | 1-2 units |
| Import | American supply routes | Medium | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: High-performance steel alloys, gun steel, engine components
- **Construction**: Long-life gun barrels, premium engine parts
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Strategic material, restricted trade

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×5 + Molybdenum ×1 | Alloying | Gun Steel ×3 | Advanced Steel Mill |
| Armor Steel ×5 + Molybdenum ×1 | Alloying | STS ×2 | Advanced Armor Mill |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~50 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -40% in Americas, +80% in Axis territories |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: American mining operations (near monopoly)
- **Major Consumers**: Premium steel production, weapons factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme geographic concentration, shipping vulnerability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Molybdenum access defines weapon system quality. Factions with molybdenum can build longer-lasting guns and more reliable engines. Factions without must accept higher maintenance costs and more frequent equipment failures.
