## Description

> *Salvaged iron and steel debris. Can be reprocessed into usable pig iron, though quality varies based on source material.*

## Lore

Scrap iron is the currency of the desperate and the opportunistic. Salvage crews pick over battle sites like vultures, hauling away twisted metal that was once someone's ship. There's no sentiment in the scrap trade - yesterday's proud cruiser is tomorrow's repair material.

The scrapyards that dot harbor towns are mountains of mangled metal, each piece with a story. Experienced scrap dealers can identify the origin of debris at a glance - Japanese steel has a different grain than American, German quality shows even when bent and burned.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Shipwrecks, battle sites | Easy | 15-40 units |
| Demolition | Damaged structures | Easy | 10-25 units |
| Trading | Scrapyards | Easy | Very cheap |
| Looting | Destroyed enemy bases | Medium | 20-50 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Reprocessed into pig iron or low-grade steel
- **Construction**: Emergency repairs only
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Low value but high volume market

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Scrap Iron ×5 | Melting | Pig Iron ×2 | Basic Foundry |
| Scrap Iron ×10 + Coal ×2 | Refining | Steel ×3 | Steel Mill |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +50% far from battle zones, -30% at active fronts |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage operations, scrapyards, recycling facilities
- **Major Consumers**: Steel mills, emergency repair depots
- **Bottlenecks**: Transport capacity, processing facilities

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Scrap iron supplements primary iron ore supplies, reducing dependence on mining operations and long-distance shipping. For resource-poor factions, effective scrap collection can mean the difference between maintaining a fleet and watching it rust away.
