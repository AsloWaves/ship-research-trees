## Description

> *Essential steelmaking additive that removes impurities and improves strength. No steel production is possible without manganese.*

---

## Lore

Manganese is the unsung hero of steel production. It doesn't make steel stronger directly - it makes steel possible. Without manganese, the impurities that ruin steel cannot be removed. Every ton of steel ever made required manganese to make it steel instead of useless iron.

The manganese mines are strategic targets of the highest order. Knock out a faction's manganese supply and you knock out their steel production. No manganese means no new ships, no new guns, no new ammunition casings. It's the silent foundation that keeps the war machine running.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Manganese deposits | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Trading | Industrial ports | Easy | Market price |
| Import | Mining regions | Easy | Steady supply |
| Salvage | Limited recovery | Hard | 2-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Steel production (required additive), specialty alloys
- **Construction**: Indirect - enables steel production
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Steady demand tied to steel production

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Pig Iron ×3 + Coal ×1 + Manganese ×0.5 | Refining | Steel ×2 | Steel Mill |
| Steel ×3 + Manganese ×1 | Heat Treatment | High-Carbon Steel ×2 | Steel Mill |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~12 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% near mining regions, +30% in industrialized areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Scattered mining regions, some concentrated deposits
- **Major Consumers**: Every steel mill in operation
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration of high-grade deposits

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Enables all steel production
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Manganese is a critical chokepoint in the steel production chain. While not as glamorous as armor steel or tungsten, disrupting manganese supplies brings steel production to a halt more effectively than destroying mills.
