## Description

> *Smokeless propellant that hurls shells from naval guns. Every battleship salvo consumes cordite by the ton.*

---

## Lore

Cordite is the breath that sends death across the ocean. This stringy, brownish propellant burns fast and clean, generating the enormous pressures needed to hurl shells weighing over a ton across twenty miles of sea. Without cordite, even the mightiest battleship becomes a floating museum.

The name comes from its cord-like appearance - long strands of processed nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. It burns more evenly than older powders, producing consistent muzzle velocities shot after shot. Gunnery officers trust cordite to deliver their shells where the rangefinders point.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Propellant factories | Medium | 8 per batch |
| Purchase | Any naval port | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Ammunition stores | Easy | 10-25 units |
| Capture | Enemy magazines | Medium | 20-50 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Shell propellant charges, all ammunition types
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Direct ammunition component
- **Trade**: Universal demand from all navies

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Glycerin ×2 + Nitric Acid ×2 + Cellulose ×1 | Processing | Cordite ×4 | Propellant Factory |
| Cordite ×3 + Brass Casing ×1 + Projectile ×1 | Assembly | Shell Round ×1 | Ammunition Factory |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at propellant plants, +20% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Propellant factories worldwide
- **Major Consumers**: All navies (ammunition production)
- **Bottlenecks**: Glycerin and nitric acid supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - No propellant, no firing
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Cordite consumption during naval combat is staggering. A single battleship salvo might consume a ton of propellant. Maintaining cordite supply is essential for sustained combat operations.
