## Description

> *Industrial workhorse acid used in countless chemical processes. From batteries to explosives, sulfuric acid makes it possible.*

---

## Lore

Sulfuric acid is the lifeblood of industry. It processes steel, refines petroleum, manufactures fertilizer, fills batteries, and serves as the starting point for countless chemical reactions. More sulfuric acid is produced than any other chemical - because everything needs it.

The oily, colorless liquid seems almost innocent until you watch it dissolve steel. Every industrial nation measures its chemical capacity partly by sulfuric acid production. Without it, chemical industry grinds to a halt, and with it goes explosives production, metal processing, and a hundred other essential processes.
