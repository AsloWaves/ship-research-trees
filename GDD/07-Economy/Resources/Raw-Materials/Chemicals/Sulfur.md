## Description

> *Yellow mineral essential for gunpowder and chemical production. The building block of naval firepower.*

## Lore

Sulfur is the devil's element - yellow as brimstone and just as dangerous when mixed properly. Every shell fired, every torpedo launched, every bomb dropped depends on sulfur somewhere in its chemical ancestry. Without it, guns fall silent.

The smell of sulfur hangs over every munitions factory and ammunition magazine. Sailors learn to recognize it - that distinctive odor means either production or destruction, depending on which end of the gun you're standing at. Sulfur is cheap and common, but its absence would cripple any navy.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Volcanic regions | Easy | 20-40 units |
| Purchase | Any port | Easy | Very cheap |
| Salvage | Chemical facilities | Easy | 10-25 units |
| Trade | Industrial regions | Easy | Bulk quantities |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Sulfuric acid, gunpowder, propellants
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High volume, low margin commodity

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Sulfur ×3 + Water ×1 | Oxidation | Sulfuric Acid ×2 | Chemical Plant |
| Sulfur ×2 + Saltpeter ×2 + Charcoal ×1 | Mixing | Gunpowder ×3 | Powder Works |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -40% near volcanic sources, +20% in remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Volcanic regions, mining operations worldwide
- **Major Consumers**: Chemical plants, ammunition factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Rarely constrained - widely available

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential but abundant
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Sulfur matters in volume. Individual units are nearly worthless, but the cumulative demand from munitions production creates steady consumption. A navy needs tons of sulfur to keep its magazines full.
