## Description

> *Self-igniting element used in incendiary weapons and smoke screens. Burns with terrifying intensity.*

---

## Lore

Phosphorus is fire that cannot be extinguished. White phosphorus ignites spontaneously in air, burning with intense heat that water cannot quench. It clings to whatever it touches, burning until nothing combustible remains. Incendiary weapons loaded with phosphorus are devastating against ships and shore installations.

The element also serves peaceful purposes - phosphorus smoke screens provide concealment for naval operations. The dense white smoke hides ships from enemy observation, buying precious minutes during vulnerable maneuvers. The same substance that burns also blinds.

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Chemical plants | Medium | 3 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Medium | Standard price |
| Mining | Phosphate deposits | Medium | 5-10 units |
| Salvage | Incendiary stores | Hard | 2-5 units (dangerous) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Incendiary weapons, smoke generators, tracer rounds
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Smoke screens, illumination rounds
- **Trade**: Moderate demand from specialized munitions

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Phosphate Rock ×5 + Coke ×2 | Reduction | Phosphorus ×2 | Chemical Plant |
| Phosphorus ×2 + Casing ×1 | Assembly | Incendiary Bomb ×1 | Munitions Factory |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~28 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% near phosphate mines, +35% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Phosphate processing plants
- **Major Consumers**: Incendiary weapon production, smoke screen manufacture
- **Bottlenecks**: Phosphate ore availability, hazardous processing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Incendiary and screening capability
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Phosphorus provides two distinct capabilities - destruction through incendiary weapons and protection through smoke screens. Both have tactical value in naval operations.
