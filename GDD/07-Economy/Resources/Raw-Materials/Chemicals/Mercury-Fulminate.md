## Description

> *Primary explosive for detonators and percussion caps. The spark that lights every bomb, shell, and mine.*

## Lore

Mercury fulminate is the trigger for everything that goes boom. This white crystalline compound is extraordinarily sensitive - friction, impact, or heat can set it off. That sensitivity makes it perfect for detonators and percussion caps, the small charges that initiate larger explosions.

Handling mercury fulminate requires nerves of steel and gentle hands. One careless moment, one dropped container, and the handler disappears in a flash. The workers who manufacture it are paid well for good reason - they earn every credit surviving another shift.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Specialized chemical plants | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major munitions depots | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Detonator stores | Hard | 1-3 units (dangerous) |
| Research | Explosives research | Medium | Unlocks production |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Detonators, percussion caps, blasting caps
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High demand from munitions manufacturers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Mercury ×1 + Nitric Acid ×2 + Alcohol ×1 | Careful Synthesis | Mercury Fulminate ×2 | Advanced Chemical Plant |
| Mercury Fulminate ×1 + Casing ×1 | Assembly | Detonator ×3 | Munitions Workshop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~165 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at chemical plants, +50% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Specialized chemical facilities (limited)
- **Major Consumers**: All munitions production
- **Bottlenecks**: Mercury supply, hazardous production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - No detonators, no explosions
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Mercury fulminate is the keystone of munitions production. Without detonators, bombs don't explode, mines don't trigger, shells don't burst. Control of mercury fulminate production controls the effectiveness of all explosive ordnance.
