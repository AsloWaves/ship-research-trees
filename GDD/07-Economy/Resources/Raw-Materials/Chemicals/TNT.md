## Description

> *Trinitrotoluene - the workhorse explosive of modern warfare. Stable enough to handle, powerful enough to sink ships.*

---

## Lore

TNT is the foundation of naval firepower. Every shell burster charge, every bomb filling, every depth charge relies on this yellow crystalline explosive. It's not the most powerful explosive available, but it's reliable, stable, and manufacturable in vast quantities.

The beauty of TNT lies in its forgiveness. Drop it, shoot it, burn it - it won't detonate without a proper detonator. This stability makes it safe to manufacture, transport, and handle. In a war where millions of shells are fired, that reliability is worth more than raw power.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Explosives factories | Medium | 5 per batch |
| Purchase | Military ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Ammunition stores | Medium | 5-15 units |
| Capture | Enemy munitions | Medium | 10-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Shell fillings, bombs, depth charges, mines
- **Construction**: Demolition charges
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Universal military demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Nitric Acid ×2 + Toluene ×1 | Nitration | TNT ×2 | Explosives Factory |
| TNT ×2 + RDX ×1 + Aluminum ×1 | Mixing | Torpex ×2 | Advanced Explosives |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~9 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at munitions plants, +30% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Explosives factories worldwide
- **Major Consumers**: Ammunition factories, bomb plants
- **Bottlenecks**: Nitric acid supply, toluene availability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Core explosive for all ordnance
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

TNT production capacity directly determines how much explosive ordnance a navy can field. More TNT means more shells, more bombs, more depth charges. It's the fundamental currency of naval destruction.
