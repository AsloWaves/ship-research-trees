## Description

> *Torpedo Explosive - the ultimate anti-ship compound. 50% more powerful than TNT, optimized for underwater detonation.*

---

## Lore

Torpex is death to ships. This aluminum-enhanced explosive mixture was engineered specifically for naval warfare - optimized to create the massive underwater shockwave that breaks keels and floods compartments. A Torpex warhead hits harder than anything else in the naval arsenal.

The secret lies in the aluminum powder mixed with RDX and TNT. When the explosive detonates, the aluminum burns in the expanding gas bubble, sustaining the pressure pulse that tears hulls apart. It's not just an explosion - it's a sustained assault on the target ship's structure.
