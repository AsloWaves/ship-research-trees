## Lore

The ship's log is the official record of everything that happens at sea. Every four hours the officer of the watch records position, course, speed, weather, and notable events. American captains maintained meticulous logs for courts of inquiry. British tradition demanded precise logkeeping - sloppy logs meant sloppy seamanship. Japanese logs recorded detailed tactical observations. German U-boat logs tracked every dive, contact, and torpedo. When ships sink, recovered logs provide critical intelligence about enemy movements, tactics, and capabilities. Court martials and inquiries rely on log entries to establish facts. Insurance claims, prize courts, and historical records all depend on accurate logs. A captain who falsifies the log commits a serious offense. Ships without proper logs face questions about their activities. Smart captains ensured backup logs in case originals were lost. The log tells the ship's story - battles fought, storms weathered, ports visited, and the daily routine of life at sea.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Chandlers | Easy | 10-15 units |
| Requisition | Naval Administration | Easy | 15-25 units |
| Salvage | Captured/Derelict Ships | Medium | 2-8 units (enemy intelligence value) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Complete navigation sets, administrative packages, intelligence analysis
- **Construction**: Required for bridge equipment, captain's quarters, navigation stations
- **Consumable**: Enables proper navigation record-keeping, provides +5% navigation accuracy, legal compliance, intelligence when captured
- **Trade**: Low value normally, high intelligence value for enemy logs, standard ship requirement

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Paper, Binding, Official Seals | Manufacturing | Log Books x25 | Printing/Binding Facility |
| Enemy Log Books | Intelligence Analysis | Strategic Information | Naval Intelligence Office |
