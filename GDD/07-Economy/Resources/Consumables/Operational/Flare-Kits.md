## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Pyrotechnic signaling devices including colored flares, parachute flares, and smoke signals. Essential for distress signals, night communication, and position marking.

## Lore

When radio fails or silence is required, flares speak across the darkness. Red flares signal distress, white illuminates night battles, green marks positions. Parachute flares drift slowly downward, casting eerie light over dark seas for minutes. Sailors abandoning ship fire flares hoping rescue vessels will spot them in vast oceans. Convoy escorts use colored flares to signal submarine contacts without breaking radio silence. American star shells illuminate targets for night gunnery. British ships carried extensive flare inventories for various tactical situations. Japanese destroyers used flares to coordinate night torpedo attacks. German U-boats surfacing at night feared flares that would expose them to aircraft. A well-timed flare could mean rescue for sinking crews, successful attacks in darkness, or tactical coordination when radios stayed silent. Ships without adequate flare supplies risked being unable to signal distress, mark positions, or communicate in combat.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Ordnance Depots | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Requisition | Military Bases | Easy | 20-35 units |
| Production | Pyrotechnics Factories | Medium | 30-50 units |
| Salvage | Lifeboats, Supply Ships | Easy | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Complete signal kits, emergency equipment sets, lifeboat provisions
- **Construction**: Bridge signal equipment, abandon ship stations, lifeboat stowage
- **Consumable**: Signals distress, illuminates area (60 second duration), marks position, enables night communication
- **Trade**: Moderate demand, essential safety equipment, regulated distribution

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Pyrotechnic Compounds, Casings, Fuses | Manufacturing | Flare Kits x20 | Ordnance Factory |
| Flare Kits x1 | Signal Use | Visual Signal / Illumination | Ship Deck or Lifeboat |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +25% in remote areas, standard in major ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All major navies - military ordnance production, pyrotechnics manufacturers
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, lifeboats, rescue services, convoy escorts
- **Bottlenecks**: Pyrotechnic chemical production, safety regulations, specialized manufacturing facilities

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Valuable for communication and survival but not critical for combat operations. Essential for distress signaling, night illumination, and tactical coordination without radio. Particularly important for merchant vessels, rescue operations, and ships operating under radio silence. Readily available but important safety equipment.
