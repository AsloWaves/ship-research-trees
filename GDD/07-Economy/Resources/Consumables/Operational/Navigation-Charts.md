## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Detailed nautical charts showing depths, hazards, currents, and coastlines. Essential for safe navigation through unfamiliar waters and combat zones.

## Lore

Navigation charts are the lifeblood of naval operations. American Hydrographic Office produces thousands of charts covering Pacific and Atlantic theaters. British Admiralty charts represent centuries of surveying expertise, marking every reef and shoal. Japanese charts excel in Pacific waters but lack detail for other theaters. German U-boat captains prize captured Allied charts showing convoy routes and minefields. Charts become outdated quickly as mines are laid and wrecks accumulate. Smart navigators mark their charts with penciled updates from recent intelligence. A ship without current charts risks running aground on uncharted obstacles or sailing into minefields. Captured enemy charts are intelligence gold, revealing their knowledge of strategic waterways.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Cartography Offices | Medium | 8-15 units |
| Quest Rewards | Survey Missions | Hard | 10-20 units |
| Salvage | Command Ships | Hard | 3-8 units |
| Intelligence Capture | Enemy Vessels | Very Hard | 5-12 units (enemy charts) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Navigation Kits, Complete Chart Collections for specific theaters
- **Construction**: Required for Bridge Navigation Equipment (20 charts per complete set), Plotting Rooms
- **Consumable**: Unlocks navigation in specific regions, reduces grounding risk by 60%, improves route planning efficiency
- **Trade**: High demand in unfamiliar theaters, strategic intelligence value, restricted distribution

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Survey Data, Cartography | Chart Production | Navigation Charts x5 | Naval Cartography Office |
| Navigation Charts x20 | Regional Compilation | Complete Theater Chart Set | Cartography Department |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~25 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +80% for unfamiliar theaters, +120% for enemy territorial waters, standard for home waters |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States Hydrographic Office, British Admiralty, Japanese Naval Cartography, German Maritime Survey
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, especially capital ships and merchant convoys, navigation officers
- **Bottlenecks**: Survey data collection, lithographic printing capacity, distribution to forward areas, chart updates for changing conditions

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Navigation charts are absolutely essential for safe and effective naval operations. Ships without proper charts face catastrophic grounding risks, cannot plan optimal routes, and may sail into minefields or coastal defenses. Possession of enemy charts provides massive intelligence advantage, revealing their understanding of strategic waterways. Accurate charts of enemy waters enable successful surprise attacks and safe approaches to invasion beaches. Chart security is paramount - captured charts must be destroyed before capture.
