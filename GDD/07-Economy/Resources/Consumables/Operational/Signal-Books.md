## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Classified codebooks for encrypted naval communications. Must be destroyed immediately if capture is imminent to prevent enemy code-breaking.

---

## Lore

Signal books contain the naval codes that protect fleet communications. American SIGABA cipher machines use complex codebooks changed monthly. British sailors famously threw weighted signal books overboard during HMS Glowworm's final moments to prevent capture. Japanese JN-25 codebooks become the target of intense Allied intelligence efforts. German Enigma naval codebooks (Kriegsmarine variations) use different settings than other services. Every signal officer knows the cardinal rule: destroy the codes before letting the enemy take them. Signal books are printed on water-soluble paper that dissolves when submerged. Compromised codes can doom entire fleets - the enemy reads every movement order and ambushes convoys with impunity.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Special Issue | Naval Communications HQ | Restricted | 1-3 units (monthly rotation) |
| Quest Rewards | Intelligence Missions | Very Hard | 1-2 units |
| Cannot Salvage | N/A | N/A | Must be destroyed before capture |
| Intelligence Capture | Enemy Vessels | Extremely Hard | 1 unit (enemy codes - massive intelligence coup) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for Secure Communications Systems, Intelligence Operations
- **Construction**: Required for Radio Room operation (1 current codebook mandatory), Fleet Communications
- **Consumable**: Enables encrypted communications, allows coordinated fleet actions, prevents enemy interception
- **Trade**: Cannot be traded (classified material), black market extremely dangerous

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Cipher Development | Cryptographic Production | Signal Book x1 | Naval Cryptography Office (Top Secret) |
| Signal Books (monthly) | Periodic Update | Current Signal Book x1 | Communications Distribution |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~154 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | N/A (not tradeable) |
| **Regional Variance** | Issued only by home nation, no regional market |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Each nation's Naval Cryptography Office (top secret facilities)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels requiring secure communications, fleet commands, shore stations
- **Bottlenecks**: Security clearances, distribution logistics, monthly replacement cycle, secure destruction protocols

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: N/A (classified, not traded)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Signal books are the most strategically sensitive items aboard any warship. Compromised codes can doom entire fleets by allowing the enemy to read all operational orders. Ships without current codes cannot participate in coordinated operations and must operate independently. Captured enemy codebooks provide unprecedented intelligence advantage - entire fleets can be ambushed, supply routes interdicted, and operations preempted. Every naval battle includes desperate efforts to prevent signal book capture. Loss of signal books often triggers complete code system replacement across the entire navy.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - extreme value justified by total inability to trade/replace easily
- **Adjustment History**: Made non-tradeable to reflect classified nature, added capture mechanics for intelligence gameplay
- **Known Issues**: Monthly rotation system needs implementation, emergency destruction mechanics required, captured enemy codes should provide temporary intelligence advantage
