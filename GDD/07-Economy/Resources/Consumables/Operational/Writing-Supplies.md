## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Pencils, pens, paper, and forms for ship administration and record-keeping. Essential for the endless paperwork of naval operations.

---

## Lore

The Navy runs on paperwork. Orders, reports, logs, requisitions, personnel records - all require writing supplies. Officers filled out forms constantly. Quartermasters tracked inventory on endless ledgers. Signalmen decoded messages and logged communications. American ships consumed reams of standardized forms. British vessels maintained traditional logs with fountain pens. Japanese officers practiced precise calligraphy in official documents. German efficiency demanded meticulous written records. Without writing supplies, administrative chaos followed - lost orders, untracked inventory, missing reports. Smart supply officers maintained ample stocks of pencils, pens, and paper. Ships ran through supplies constantly with daily administrative tasks. A vessel without proper writing materials couldn't maintain required documentation, track operations, or communicate officially. The humble pencil enabled naval bureaucracy.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Essential for administration but no strategic importance. Ships without writing supplies face administrative difficulties but not operational crises. Cheap, widely available, low priority. Enables bureaucracy rather than combat capability.
