## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Manila and hemp line for rigging, securing equipment, mooring, and countless shipboard tasks. The universal naval tool.

---

## Lore

Every warship runs on rope. Mooring lines secure ships to docks. Running rigging operates equipment. Cargo nets move supplies. Towing hawsers save disabled vessels. Sailors splice, whip, and coil rope constantly. American ships used standardized manila line. British tradition measured seamanship by rope work quality. Japanese vessels employed traditional hemp rope techniques. German efficiency demanded proper rope maintenance and inventory. A frayed line at the wrong moment could mean disaster - a failed tow, lost cargo, or injury. Smart bosuns maintained ample rope stores and replaced worn lines before failure. Green sailors learned seamanship through endless rope drills. Old salts could identify rope types by touch in darkness. Ships consumed rope constantly through wear, weather, and operational use. A vessel without adequate rope supply faced crippled operations.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Any Port | Easy | 20-30 units |
| Requisition | Naval Supply Depots | Easy | 25-45 units |
| Production | Rope Works | Easy | 40-70 units |
| Salvage | Derelict Ships | Easy | 10-25 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Rigging assemblies, cargo handling equipment, towing gear, emergency repair kits
- **Construction**: Ship rigging, mooring systems, cargo handling, boat davits
- **Consumable**: Enables mooring, towing, cargo operations, equipment securing, general shipboard work
- **Trade**: Low value bulk commodity, universally needed

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Manila/Hemp Fiber | Rope Making | Rope x50 | Rope Works |
| Rope | Splicing/Rigging | Various Rigging Assemblies | Ship Deck |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | None - standardized commodity |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All nations - rope works, naval suppliers, civilian manufacturers
- **Major Consumers**: All naval and merchant vessels, shipyards, ports, cargo operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Fiber supply (manila, hemp), manufacturing capacity (minimal)

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Essential for ship operations but cheap and universally available. Ships without adequate rope face operational difficulties but not immediate crisis. Consumed steadily through normal wear and operations. Low strategic value but high operational necessity.
