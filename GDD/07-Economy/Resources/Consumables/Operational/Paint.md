Standard naval paint for hull and superstructure maintenance. Protects metal from rust and keeps ships looking shipshape.

## Lore

A warship's paint is more than appearance - it's protection against the sea's corrosive assault. Salt spray, sun, and waves eat away at exposed metal relentlessly. Painting ship was a constant battle in the endless war against rust. American ships wore regulation Navy Gray. British vessels sported Admiralty Gray schemes. Japanese ships carried traditional gray-green tones. German raiders sometimes repainted entirely to disguise themselves as neutral vessels. Sailors spent countless hours chipping rust, priming, and painting. A rusty ship signaled poor discipline and low morale. Fresh paint meant a taut ship with standards. Drydock visits included complete repainting from waterline to masthead. Ships consumed paint by the ton maintaining appearances and preventing corrosion. A well-painted ship lasted longer, fought better, and inspired confidence. Peeling paint meant structural deterioration was beginning - catch it early or pay later in repairs.
