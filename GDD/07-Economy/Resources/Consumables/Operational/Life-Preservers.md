## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Cork and canvas flotation vests that keep sailors afloat in water. Essential abandon-ship equipment that saves lives when vessels go down.

---

## Lore

In the cold waters of the Atlantic and Pacific, a life preserver means the difference between drowning in minutes or surviving hours awaiting rescue. These cork-filled vests keep exhausted sailors afloat when ships sink beneath them. American Mae West life vests earned their nickname from the buoyant shape they created. British kapok-filled preservers were standard issue for Royal Navy and merchant crews. Japanese sailors wore simpler designs, often inadequate for long survival in open water. German U-boat crews knew life preservers offered only brief hope in icy Atlantic waters. Survivors of Bismarck, Indianapolis, and countless merchant vessels owed their lives to these simple devices. Ships that skimp on life preservers commit murder - when abandon ship is ordered, there must be enough for every soul aboard. Captains who maintained full inventories saved crew lives when disaster struck. Those floating orange vests bob in empty oceans, marking where men went down and some survived.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Requisition | Military Bases | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Production | Safety Equipment Factories | Medium | 20-40 units |
| Salvage | Sinking Ships, Lifeboats | Easy | 3-10 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Abandon-ship equipment sets, lifeboat survival kits, safety compliance packages
- **Construction**: Required for all vessels (1 per crew member minimum), lifeboat stations, muster points
- **Consumable**: Increases crew survival rate in abandon-ship scenarios by 75%, enables water survival
- **Trade**: High demand for merchant vessels, safety-critical equipment, regulated requirements

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Cork/Kapok, Canvas, Straps | Manufacturing | Life Preservers x15 | Safety Equipment Factory |
| Life Preservers (equipped) | Abandon Ship | Crew Survival in Water | Ship Deck / Lifeboat |

| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +40% in combat zones, +20% in high-risk areas, standard elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All nations - safety equipment manufacturers, military suppliers
- **Major Consumers**: All naval and merchant vessels, convoy organizers, safety compliance authorities
- **Bottlenecks**: Cork/kapok supply, canvas production, manufacturing capacity, safety inspections

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Life-saving equipment with direct impact on crew survival rates. Mandatory safety equipment for naval and merchant vessels. Ships without adequate supplies face morale problems and potential mutiny. High value in combat zones where ship losses are frequent. Critical for maintaining crew confidence when sailing dangerous waters.
