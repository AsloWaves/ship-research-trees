## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Navy rum for the traditional daily tot and special occasions. A cornerstone of Royal Navy tradition and crew morale.

---

## Lore

"Splice the mainbrace" - the order to issue extra rum rations for exceptional service or victory. The Royal Navy's daily rum tot was sacred tradition dating back centuries. At noon, the bosun's mate piped "Up Spirits" and crews received their measure of grog - rum diluted with water. British sailors treasured their tot. American ships officially banned alcohol but captains sometimes bent rules for morale. Commonwealth navies followed British traditions religiously. The rum tot rewarded hard work, celebrated victories, and made harsh conditions bearable. Stopping the tot without cause risked serious morale problems. Smart captains used rum strategically - extra rations after brutal watches or successful actions. Crews who earned their rum fought harder for captains who honored tradition. The Royal Navy finally ended the daily tot in 1970, but during WWII it remained vital for morale and tradition.
