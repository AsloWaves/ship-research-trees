## Lore

In the Imperial Japanese Navy, sake was more than a simple beverage - it represented a sacred connection to homeland traditions during long deployments in the Pacific. Unlike Western navies that rationed rum or beer, the IJN maintained sake stores as a morale-critical supply item. Distribution often coincided with victory celebrations, Imperial holidays, or particularly difficult operations. However, as the war progressed and supply lines tightened after 1943, sake became increasingly scarce on frontline vessels, forcing quartermasters to reserve it for special occasions. Submarine crews and surface raiders operating far from home ports particularly valued sake rations as a reminder of Japan. The beverage's cultural weight made it a powerful morale tool, with commanders using special distributions to mark significant events or boost crew spirits before dangerous missions.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Requisition | Japanese Home Islands | Easy | 20-30 units |
| Supply Ship Transfer | Japanese Controlled Ports | Medium | 10-15 units |
| Black Market Trade | Neutral Ports | Hard | 5-10 units |
| Captured Supplies | Enemy Japanese Vessels | Very Hard | 15-25 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not applicable - consumed directly
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: +15% morale for Japanese crews (4 hours), +25% for special occasions. Non-Japanese crews gain only +5% morale.
- **Trade**: High demand in Japanese ports, exotic novelty item elsewhere. Can be traded for intelligence with Japanese-speaking NPCs.

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~9 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High (especially post-1943) |
| **Regional Variance** | Japan: Base price. Pacific Islands: +300%. Allied ports: +500% (rare exotic) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Japanese Home Islands (Kobe, Kyoto regions), Korea, Manchuria
- **Major Consumers**: Imperial Japanese Navy vessels, Pacific garrison forces, Japanese civilian population
- **Bottlenecks**: Limited production capacity, submarine interdiction of supply routes, competing civilian demand, rice shortages (1944-45)

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (High morale impact for Japanese forces)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (Niche market, faction-specific)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Increasingly rare as war progresses)

While sake has limited combat utility, its psychological importance to IJN crews makes it strategically valuable for maintaining fighting effectiveness. Japanese commanders historically prioritized morale maintenance through cultural items, and sake shortages could indicate broader supply chain failures. For Allied players, captured sake can be valuable trading currency with Japanese-controlled NPCs or black market contacts. The increasing scarcity after 1943 reflects historical rice shortages and disrupted supply lines.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - faction-specific bonus prevents abuse while maintaining cultural authenticity
- **Adjustment History**: Initial design had same morale effect across all factions; reduced to prevent non-Japanese players from stockpiling
- **Known Issues**: Monitor black market pricing to prevent exploit loops with captured supplies
