## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Standard military rations for crew sustenance. Self-contained meals with long shelf life for extended operations.

---

## Lore

An army marches on its stomach, and a navy floats on its rations. Standard military rations provide the baseline nutrition for crews at sea. American K-rations and C-rations, British compo packs, Japanese Type 3 combat rations - each nation developed portable, shelf-stable food for combat conditions. These aren't gourmet meals, but they keep crews functional during extended operations. A well-fed crew fights better, works harder, and maintains morale under stress. Inadequate rations led to scurvy on long Pacific patrols, reduced combat effectiveness, and crew dissatisfaction. Smart captains ensure adequate ration stocks before extended missions. While fresh food is preferred, rations provide the essential fallback when supply lines stretch thin or combat operations prevent regular provisioning.
