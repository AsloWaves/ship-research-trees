## Lore

Tobacco was arguably the most universally valued comfort item across all WWII naval forces. Unlike alcohol, which varied by national tradition, cigarettes and pipe tobacco were issued to virtually every navy's personnel. US forces included cigarettes in K-rations and C-rations, while British sailors received duty-free tobacco as part of their standard provisions. The psychological importance of smoking during high-stress combat situations made tobacco nearly as essential as food to many sailors. German U-boat crews particularly prized American cigarettes captured from Allied ships, considering them superior to German brands. Japanese sailors received tobacco rations despite shortages worsening throughout the war. Cigarettes also served as unofficial currency - sailors traded them for favors, information, or extra rations. Watch standers on night duty valued tobacco for staying alert, and post-battle stress was often managed with a smoke break. The blue haze of cigarette smoke became synonymous with naval life, from flag bridges to engine rooms.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (universally produced and demanded) |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - prices stable globally. US ports: Base price. Pacific islands: +20%. Blockaded ports: +150% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (Virginia, North Carolina), British Empire (India, Rhodesia), Turkey, Japan (domestic varieties)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces, universal demand across military and civilian sectors
- **Bottlenecks**: Shipping priority conflicts with war materiel, humidity damage during transport, paper shortages for cigarettes

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical for morale maintenance)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Universal currency-like trading value)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (Generally available but always in demand)

Tobacco's strategic importance transcends its direct morale benefit - it serves as universal currency in the informal naval economy. Players can use tobacco to gain favors from NPCs, obtain information, smooth diplomatic interactions, and conduct black market trades. The resource's light weight and high stack limit make it ideal for cargo space optimization. Smart players maintain tobacco reserves not just for crew morale but as emergency trade goods. During extended campaigns or blockade situations, tobacco scarcity becomes a real concern affecting crew performance. The resource represents the intersection of psychology, economics, and logistics in naval warfare.
