## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Naval-grade beer ration issued primarily to Royal Navy crews. Provides morale boost and maintains traditional 'tot' culture aboard British vessels.

---

## Lore

The Royal Navy's tradition of alcohol rations dated back centuries, though by WWII, spirits had largely replaced beer on most vessels due to storage constraints. However, beer remained popular aboard larger ships with adequate refrigeration and when available at port. British breweries produced special 'government ale' with lower alcohol content specifically for naval consumption. Unlike the daily rum tot (discontinued in 1970), beer was typically issued during shore leave or special occasions. Commonwealth navies followed similar practices, with Canadian and Australian vessels maintaining their own brewing traditions. The drink served as both refreshment and social lubricant, fostering crew cohesion during off-duty hours. US Navy ships officially prohibited alcohol except on foreign-flagged vessels, though this rule was sometimes creatively interpreted when resupplying from Royal Navy stores.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Requisition | British Commonwealth Ports | Easy | 25-40 units |
| Supply Ship Transfer | Allied Controlled Waters | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Local Purchase | Neutral/Friendly Ports | Easy | 20-35 units |
| Brewery Direct | Major Port Cities | Medium | 40-60 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not applicable - consumed directly
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: +10% morale for British/Commonwealth crews (3 hours), +8% for other Western factions. Minimal effect on Axis crews.
- **Trade**: Steady demand at British ports, moderate value elsewhere. Can be used for friendly reputation gains with Royal Navy NPCs.

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A - Direct consumption only |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (stable production and demand) |
| **Regional Variance** | UK ports: Base price. Mediterranean: +50%. Pacific: +150%. Axis ports: +300% (if available) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: British Isles, Canada, Australia, United States (limited naval use)
- **Major Consumers**: Royal Navy vessels, Commonwealth forces, merchant marine crews
- **Bottlenecks**: Refrigeration requirements, cargo space competition, glass/bottle shortages, regional availability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (Modest morale boost, non-essential)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (Steady but limited market)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (Generally available but bulky to transport)

Beer represents a quality-of-life provision rather than a strategic necessity. While it provides morale benefits, its bulk and refrigeration needs make it a luxury on weight-constrained vessels. Royal Navy commanders valued beer as a crew welfare item that reinforced naval traditions and unit cohesion. The resource's main strategic importance lies in maintaining long-term crew effectiveness through morale management, particularly during extended deployments where fresh provisions are scarce. Players operating British vessels should balance beer stores against more critical provisions.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | +20% | Available but officially prohibited on USN vessels |
| United Kingdom | Very Common | Base price | Standard provision, widely distributed |
| Japan | Very Rare | +350% | Cultural unfamiliarity, minimal demand |
| Germany | Uncommon | +100% | Kriegsmarine preferred spirits, beer less common at sea |
