## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Essential tools and components for repairing ship electrical systems. Includes fuses, wire, insulation, and testing equipment.

## Lore

Modern warships are electrical mazes - fire control computers, radar systems, radio equipment, and damage control lighting all depend on functioning electrical systems. A single shell hit can create cascading electrical failures that cripple a ship's fighting capability. American ships particularly relied on sophisticated electrical systems for their advanced fire control, making these repair kits essential. These kits contain replacement fuses, insulated copper wire, solder, multimeters, and emergency lighting components. British electricians on HMS Prince of Wales struggled with electrical failures after torpedo damage, while American crews on USS Franklin restored power to critical systems despite catastrophic fire damage. Without working electrical systems, even undamaged guns can't aim, radars go blind, and internal communications fail.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Easy | 1-5 kits |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Medium | 1-6 kits |
| Craft | Electronics Workshop | Medium | 1 kit per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Spare Parts to create Advanced Electronics Systems
- **Construction**: Required for radar installations and fire control upgrades
- **Consumable**: Restores 20-30% of electrical system functionality, repairs damaged fire control systems
- **Trade**: High demand at forward bases, moderate prices in rear areas

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper Wire, Fuses, Tools | Assembly | Electrical Repair Kit | Workshop |
| Salvaged Electronics | Refurbishment | Electrical Repair Kit | Electronics Lab |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~30 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Pacific theater +25%, Atlantic bases +15%, industrial ports standard |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (General Electric factories), United Kingdom (Siemens facilities), Germany (specialist manufacturers)
- **Major Consumers**: Modern warships with radar, carriers, cruisers with advanced fire control
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper wire availability, precision instrument production, skilled labor shortages

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Critical for maintaining modern warship combat effectiveness. Ships with damaged electrical systems lose radar, fire control, and communications - effectively reducing them to pre-1900 fighting capability. Particularly vital for American and British ships that rely heavily on electrical fire control systems. A ship without electrical repairs is a floating target.
