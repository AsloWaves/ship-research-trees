## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Replacement parts and tools for bilge and fire pumps. Critical for controlling flooding and firefighting operations.

---

## Lore

Pumps are the heart of damage control - they remove water from flooded compartments, supply firefighting hoses, and maintain hull integrity after damage. A working pump system can mean the difference between controlled flooding and catastrophic sinking. HMS Prince of Wales sank partly due to pump failures that couldn't keep up with flooding. Conversely, USS Yorktown survived multiple torpedo and bomb hits at Coral Sea largely due to effective pump operations. These kits contain replacement impellers, seals, bearings, drive belts, and valve components for the various pump systems throughout a warship. From small auxiliary pumps to massive main bilge pumps moving thousands of gallons per minute, all require regular maintenance and emergency repairs. Without functional pumps, even minor flooding becomes lethal, and firefighters lose their water supply.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Easy | 1-5 kits |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Medium | 1-6 kits |
| Craft | Machine Shop | Medium | 1 kit per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Spare Parts to create Advanced Pump Systems
- **Construction**: Essential for damage control stations and firefighting systems
- **Consumable**: Restores pump functionality, increases flooding control by 20-30%
- **Trade**: High demand at all naval bases, stable prices

### Processing & Refinement

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~41 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Combat zones +30%, rear areas standard |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (industrial manufacturers), United Kingdom (Birmingham factories), Japan (limited production)
- **Major Consumers**: All warships, particularly large vessels with complex pump systems
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision seal manufacturing, specialized impeller production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Critical for damage control effectiveness. Ships with damaged pump systems cannot control flooding or fight fires effectively. Essential for keeping damaged vessels afloat long enough to reach port. High military value reflects importance to ship survival.
