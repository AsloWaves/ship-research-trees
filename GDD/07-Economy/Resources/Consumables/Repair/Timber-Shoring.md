## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Pre-cut wooden beams and wedges for emergency hull bracing. Essential for shoring up damaged bulkheads and containing breaches.

---

## Lore

When a torpedo or shell breaches the hull, timber shoring provides the critical first line of defense against flooding. Damage control teams wedge pre-cut beams against bulkheads to prevent collapse, brace weakened frames, and create temporary barriers to contain water. USS Franklin survived catastrophic damage partly because crews shored up sagging decks before they collapsed. HMS Exeter at the Java Sea battle used timber shoring to stabilize damaged compartments during extended combat. These kits contain hardwood beams cut to standard lengths, wedges for tight fitting, and steel brackets for reinforcement. While steel ships seem to have no need for wood, timber's compressibility and ease of cutting make it ideal for emergency bracing. Every warship carries substantial timber stocks for damage control - it's saved more ships than any high-tech system.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Easy | 2-8 beams |
| Salvage | Shipwrecks, Shore Facilities | Easy | 3-10 beams |
| Craft | Sawmill, Shipyard | Easy | 10 beams per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Hull Patch Kits to create Emergency Bulkhead Reinforcements
- **Construction**: Essential for damage control training facilities
- **Consumable**: Braces damaged structures, prevents bulkhead collapse, contains flooding (20-30% reduction)
- **Trade**: Moderate demand, bulky cargo limits trading

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Raw Timber | Cutting & Treating | Timber Shoring | Sawmill |
| Hardwood Logs | Dimensioning | Timber Shoring | Shipyard Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Pacific islands +40% (limited timber), forested regions -10% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes), United Kingdom (naval yards), Scandinavia
- **Major Consumers**: All warships, particularly capital ships and carriers
- **Bottlenecks**: Shipping volume (bulk), hardwood availability in Pacific theater

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Critical for damage control but relatively available. Essential for containing major hull damage. The simplicity and effectiveness make it indispensable despite being low-tech. Weight and bulk mean careful inventory management.
