## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Assortment of common mechanical parts and fasteners for general repairs. Contains valves, bolts, brackets, and small components.

## Lore

Ships are complex machines with thousands of mechanical components that wear out, break, or get damaged in combat. A missing valve, broken bracket, or stripped bolt can cascade into a major system failure. Smart captains maintain well-stocked spare parts inventories for routine maintenance and battle repairs. These kits contain the most commonly needed items: pipe fittings, valve assemblies, mounting brackets, nuts and bolts in various sizes, small gears, springs, and general hardware. German U-boats on extended patrols relied heavily on comprehensive spare parts stocks. American destroyers in the Pacific maintained floating workshops with extensive spare inventories. British convoys carried spare parts for virtually every shipboard system. The difference between a minor breakdown and a mission-ending failure often comes down to having the right part immediately available.
