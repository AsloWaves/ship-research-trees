## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Canvas bags filled with sand for blast protection and damage containment. Versatile emergency shielding for vulnerable areas.

---

## Lore

Simple but effective, sandbags have protected sailors since the age of sail. Stacked around exposed positions, they absorb shell fragments and small-caliber rounds. During air attacks, crews stack sandbags around anti-aircraft gun positions for splinter protection. They reinforce vulnerable blast doors, shore up damaged bulkheads, and contain flooding by directing water flow. American PT boats in the Pacific stacked sandbags around crew positions for added protection against strafing. British merchant ships fortified bridge wings with sandbag walls. Japanese destroyers used sandbags to protect depth charge crews during convoy attacks. While they won't stop a direct shell hit, sandbags reduce casualties from fragmentation and blast effects. Their simplicity and versatility make them universally valued across all navies.
