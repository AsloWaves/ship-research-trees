## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Traditional fiber caulking material for sealing seams and minor leaks. Ancient but effective for emergency repairs.

---

## Lore

Oakum is as old as wooden ships themselves - tarred hemp fiber picked from old rope and hammered into seams to make them watertight. While WW2 warships are steel, oakum remains invaluable for temporary leak sealing and emergency caulking. Older vessels, auxiliary craft, wooden-hulled minesweepers, and PT boats still rely heavily on traditional caulking methods. Even modern steel ships carry oakum for plugging shell holes, sealing pipe joints, and emergency hull patches where the fibrous material can be hammered into gaps before applying sealant. British merchant sailors and American Liberty ship crews kept oakum readily available for the constant minor leaks that plagued welded construction. It's cheap, lightweight, and remarkably effective for small-scale repairs. While not glamorous, oakum has saved more ships through mundane leak prevention than dramatic damage control efforts.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Any Port | Easy | 10-30 units |
| Craft | Shipyard Workshop | Easy | 20 units per batch |
| Salvage | Wooden Ships, Supply Depots | Easy | 15-40 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with pitch/tar to create Waterproofing Kits
- **Construction**: Essential for wooden vessel construction and repair facilities
- **Consumable**: Seals minor leaks, reduces flooding by small amounts (5-10%)
- **Trade**: Very low value, universally available, minimal trading interest

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Old Rope, Hemp Fiber | Picking and Tarring | Oakum | Workshop |
| Raw Hemp | Processing | Oakum | Any Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | None - universally cheap and available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All ports and shipyards, rope manufacturers, salvage operations
- **Major Consumers**: Merchant vessels, auxiliary craft, older warships, minesweepers
- **Bottlenecks**: None - extremely abundant

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐

Low strategic value but universally useful. While not critical for modern warship operations, it's an essential basic supply that prevents minor problems from becoming major issues. The true value is in its simplicity and universal availability.
