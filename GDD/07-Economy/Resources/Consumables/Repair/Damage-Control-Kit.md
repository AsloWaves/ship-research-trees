## Description

Emergency repair supplies for immediate battle damage response. Essential for keeping ships operational during combat.

## Lore

Damage control kits represent the frontline defense against catastrophic hull breaches. Every navy learned the hard way that battles are won not just by firing shells, but by staying afloat long enough to fire them. American damage control parties aboard carriers at Midway proved their worth, while British crews on HMS Prince of Wales struggled with inadequate training. These standardized kits contain the essential tools every damage control party needs: wooden plugs, rubber gaskets, quick-setting cement, and emergency lighting. The difference between returning to port and becoming a reef often comes down to having these supplies readily available.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~32 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher prices in Pacific theater (+30%), lower at major US ports (-15%) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (West Coast yards), United Kingdom (Portsmouth, Liverpool), Japan (Kure, Yokosuka)
- **Major Consumers**: Frontline combat ships, convoy escorts, carriers
- **Bottlenecks**: Rubber shortages, specialized tool production delays

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Critical for maintaining fleet operational readiness. Ships without adequate damage control supplies are effectively suicide vessels in prolonged engagements. The ability to repair battle damage while still under fire can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Navies that invest in damage control training and supplies historically suffered far fewer total losses.
