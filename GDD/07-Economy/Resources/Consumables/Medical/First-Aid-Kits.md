## Lore

Standard issue across all naval forces, first aid kits are the first line of defense against casualties in naval engagements. American kits feature Johnson & Johnson supplies, British kits contain St. John Ambulance materials, while Japanese kits include traditional field dressings. German U-boats maintain compact versions in watertight containers. Every sailor is trained in basic first aid, making these kits invaluable during the critical first minutes after battle damage when the ship's medical officer may be overwhelmed or incapacitated.
