## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Sulfonamide antibacterial drugs for preventing wound infections. Standard treatment before penicillin became widely available.

## Lore

Sulfa drugs revolutionized battlefield medicine in the late 1930s, dramatically reducing infection-related deaths. American pharmaceutical companies mass-produce sulfa powder and tablets for Allied forces, while German chemists at IG Farben developed the original compounds. Every first aid kit contains sulfa powder for sprinkling on open wounds. British naval surgeons credit sulfa drugs with saving countless lives during the early war years before penicillin availability. Japanese forces struggle with limited sulfa supplies as the war progresses. The distinctive yellow-white powder has become synonymous with wound care, and experienced sailors can apply it one-handed even during combat. Some crews develop allergic reactions, requiring careful medical monitoring.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Medical Supply Depots | Easy | 15-30 units |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Medium | 5-12 units |
| Production | Pharmaceutical Facilities | Easy | 50+ units |
| Loot | Medical Convoys | Medium | 10-25 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for First Aid Kits (5x Sulfa Drugs per kit), Burn Treatment Kits (3x per kit)
- **Construction**: Medical Bay stocking (30 units per bay), Field Hospital supplies (100 units)
- **Consumable**: Prevents infection status, reduces wound severity by 20%, applies 30-second regeneration buff
- **Trade**: Steady demand, moderate prices, essential bulk cargo for medical supply runs

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~6 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +40% in Pacific theater (Japanese supply issues), +20% in remote ports, standard at major bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (mass production), Germany (original developers), United Kingdom (domestic production), Switzerland (neutral exports)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, field hospitals, forward medical stations, first aid kit manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Chemical precursor availability, pharmaceutical plant capacity, packaging materials, quality control for medical-grade purity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Sulfa drugs are the backbone of naval wound care before penicillin becomes available. Ships without sulfa supplies experience significantly higher infection rates and longer recovery times. While not as dramatic as morphine or penicillin, sulfa drugs quietly save more lives through consistent infection prevention. The difference between having sulfa and not having it often determines whether minor wounds become fatal complications. Smart captains stockpile sulfa drugs alongside ammunition.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - effective infection prevention without overshadowing penicillin
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced healing buff from 30% to 20% to maintain penicillin's superiority, added regeneration buff for gradual healing
- **Known Issues**: May be underutilized by players who prefer instant healing items, consider adding allergy reaction mechanics for realism
