## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Sterile cotton gauze bandages for wound dressing and hemorrhage control. The most basic and essential medical supply aboard any naval vessel.

---

## Lore

The humble bandage is the workhorse of naval medicine, used constantly for everything from minor cuts to major trauma. American cotton production ensures abundant supplies for Allied forces, while Japanese forces sometimes resort to silk bandages due to cotton shortages. British naval tradition demands every sailor know how to apply a proper compression bandage. German naval doctors praise the efficiency of their pre-packaged sterile bandage rolls. In desperate situations, captains have been known to raid ship's linens to fashion emergency bandages.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +30% in Pacific islands, standard elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (cotton belt), India (British supply), Japan (silk alternatives), Germany (pre-war stockpiles)
- **Major Consumers**: Every naval vessel, hospitals, field stations, universal need
- **Bottlenecks**: Cotton supply disruption, sterilization capacity, shipping space allocation

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

While individually low-value, bandages are absolutely essential in quantity. Running out of bandages during extended operations can be catastrophic. Smart captains always maintain large stockpiles. The difference between adequate and inadequate bandage supplies can mean the difference between recovering wounded crew or losing them to infection.
