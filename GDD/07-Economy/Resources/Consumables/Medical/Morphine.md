## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Powerful opiate analgesic for severe pain management. Essential for treating critically wounded sailors during and after naval combat.

## Lore

Morphine syrettes are among the most precious medical supplies aboard any warship. American pharmacies produce them in vast quantities for Allied forces, while German U-boat captains jealously guard their limited supplies. The British Royal Navy maintains strict accountability protocols, with each dose logged and countersigned by the ship's medical officer. Japanese naval doctors often face shortages due to disrupted supply lines. Every sailor knows the distinctive tubular syrette case, and the relief it brings to wounded comrades. Corpsmen carry morphine in specially designed pouches for immediate battlefield use. The difference between having morphine and not having it can determine whether a wounded sailor remains combat-effective or succumbs to shock and pain.

| **Base Value** | ~25 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +100% in Pacific combat zones, +75% in Atlantic theater, standard at major ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (pharmaceutical industry), United Kingdom (pre-war stockpiles), Turkey and India (opium source materials)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels in combat zones, hospital ships, field hospitals, casualty clearing stations
- **Bottlenecks**: Opium supply disruption, pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, controlled substance regulations, theft and black market diversion

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Morphine is absolutely critical for combat operations. Ships without adequate morphine supplies experience devastating morale penalties and higher casualty rates. Wounded sailors who don't receive timely morphine administration suffer from shock and may die from otherwise survivable wounds. The psychological impact of knowing morphine is available cannot be overstated - crews fight more confidently when they know pain relief is available. Captains who skimp on morphine supplies risk mutiny during extended operations.
