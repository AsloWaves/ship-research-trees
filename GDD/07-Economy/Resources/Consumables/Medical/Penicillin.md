## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Revolutionary antibiotic capable of curing previously fatal infections. Rare and precious, prioritized for critical cases where sulfa drugs prove ineffective.

## Lore

Penicillin is the miracle drug of World War II, discovered by Fleming but mass-produced by American pharmaceutical companies starting in 1942. Early batches are so precious they're reserved exclusively for officers and critical personnel. British sailors call it "the yellow magic" due to its distinctive color. By 1943, production increases enough for broader naval use, though it remains rare. American hospital ships receive priority allocations, while German forces are largely denied access due to Allied monopoly on production. Japanese medical officers desperately seek penicillin through black market channels. Each dose is carefully documented and rationed. Sailors know that receiving penicillin means their injury is serious enough to warrant the precious resource. The drug's ability to cure gangrene and sepsis has saved countless limbs and lives that would have been lost in earlier conflicts.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Major Naval Hospitals | Hard | 3-10 units |
| Quest Rewards | Critical Medical Missions | Very Hard | 5-12 units |
| Salvage | Hospital Ships (Allied) | Very Hard | 2-6 units |
| Special Orders | Strategic Command | Restricted | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Elite Medical Kits (1x Penicillin + Advanced Supplies)
- **Construction**: Required for Advanced Medical Bay upgrades (5 units per elite bay)
- **Consumable**: Cures infection status immediately, restores 40% crew health, removes all disease debuffs, 5-minute cooldown
- **Trade**: Extremely high demand, premium prices everywhere, restricted trade (requires special authorization), black market prices astronomical

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Penicillium Culture x1, Fermentation Process | Pharmaceutical Manufacturing | Penicillin x3 | Advanced Pharmaceutical Facility |
| Penicillin x1, Advanced Medical Supplies | Elite Assembly | Elite Medical Kit x1 | Hospital Ship Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~34 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | +200% in Pacific (extreme scarcity), +150% in Atlantic combat zones, +100% in Mediterranean, standard only at US East Coast ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (near monopoly on mass production), United Kingdom (limited production, Fleming's lab), Canada (emerging production by 1944)
- **Major Consumers**: Hospital ships, fleet flagships, naval hospitals, critical care facilities, VIP medical staff
- **Bottlenecks**: Fermentation tank capacity, Penicillium culture viability, purification challenges, cold storage requirements during transport, Allied strategic control

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Penicillin represents a decisive Allied advantage in the war. Its ability to cure infections that would otherwise be fatal gives Allied forces superior crew survival and recovery rates. A single dose can save a critically wounded officer who would otherwise die from sepsis. The strategic value is so high that penicillin supplies are guarded as carefully as ammunition. Axis forces desperately seek to capture or steal penicillin supplies. Possessing adequate penicillin stocks can determine whether a fleet maintains operational capability or succumbs to cascading medical casualties during extended campaigns.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - powerful effects justified by extreme rarity and cost
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced healing from 50% to 40% to prevent it from being too dominant, increased cooldown to 5 minutes to prevent spam
- **Known Issues**: Availability may need adjustment by year/campaign phase to reflect historical production increases, consider faction-specific restrictions
