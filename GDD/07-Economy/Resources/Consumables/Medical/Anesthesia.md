## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Volatile anesthetic agents for surgical procedures. Essential for performing emergency operations aboard ship without inflicting unbearable pain.

---

## Lore

Ether and chloroform are the primary naval anesthetics, though both pose risks in combat conditions. American ships use portable anesthesia machines with vaporizers for controlled administration. British naval surgeons pride themselves on efficient anesthesia technique, minimizing agent consumption during prolonged surgeries. Japanese medical officers often face shortages, forcing difficult decisions about rationing anesthesia for the most critical cases. German submarines carry minimal anesthesia due to fire hazards in confined oxygen-limited spaces. The distinctive sweet smell of ether becomes associated with the operating theater. Skilled anesthetists can maintain unconsciousness through entire surgeries with remarkably small quantities. Without anesthesia, surgeons must rely on morphine and speed, or perform agonizing procedures on semi-conscious patients.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Major Naval Hospitals | Hard | 3-8 units |
| Quest Rewards | Surgical Mission Support | Very Hard | 5-10 units |
| Salvage | Hospital Ships | Very Hard | 1-4 units |
| Special Medical Orders | Strategic Medical Command | Restricted | 5-10 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Complete Surgical Suites (anesthesia equipment), Operating Theater Systems
- **Construction**: Required for Surgical Bays (3 units per bay), Hospital Ship Operating Rooms (10 units minimum)
- **Consumable**: Enables surgical procedures (required for using Surgical Kits effectively), improves surgery success rate by 40%
- **Trade**: Very high demand, premium prices, controlled substance (requires medical certification)

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Chemical Precursors x3, Distillation | Pharmaceutical Production | Anesthesia x5 | Pharmaceutical Facility |
| Anesthesia x3, Surgical Equipment | Surgical Suite Assembly | Complete Operating Theater | Hospital Ship Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~157 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +140% in forward combat zones, +90% in remote theaters, standard at major medical centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (chemical industry), Germany (pharmaceutical expertise), United Kingdom (domestic production), Switzerland (neutral exports)
- **Major Consumers**: Hospital ships, capital ship medical bays, naval hospitals, surgical teams
- **Bottlenecks**: Chemical precursor availability, distillation equipment, volatile substance handling, fire safety concerns in storage

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Anesthesia enables effective battlefield surgery. Without it, surgeons must work on conscious or barely sedated patients, drastically reducing success rates and causing unbearable suffering. Ships with adequate anesthesia supplies can perform complex life-saving surgeries that would be impossible otherwise. The difference between having anesthesia and not having it often determines whether critical personnel survive catastrophic injuries. Essential for maintaining surgical capability during extended operations.
