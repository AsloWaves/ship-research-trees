Complete set of surgical instruments for battlefield operations. Enables emergency surgeries that can save critically wounded crew aboard ship.

## Lore

Naval surgical kits contain scalpels, forceps, hemostats, bone saws, and sutures - everything needed for emergency battlefield surgery. American kits feature stainless steel instruments in waterproof cases. British naval surgeons train extensively with their standardized kits, able to perform amputations in pitching seas. Japanese medical officers maintain their surgical kits with ritualistic care, keeping blades razor-sharp. German U-boat doctors carry compact surgical kits designed for cramped spaces. The sight of a surgical kit being opened means someone's life hangs in the balance. Skilled naval surgeons can perform miracles with these kits - removing shrapnel, repairing arterial damage, even emergency amputations to save lives. Ships without surgical capabilities must evacuate critical casualties, often a death sentence in combat zones.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~187 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +120% in forward combat zones, +80% in remote theaters, standard at major medical centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (medical instrument manufacturers), Germany (precision engineering), United Kingdom (established medical suppliers), Switzerland (neutral high-quality exports)
- **Major Consumers**: Hospital ships, fleet medical officers, naval hospitals, capital ship medical bays
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision instrument manufacturing, stainless steel availability, skilled instrument craftsmanship, sterilization and packaging

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Surgical kits represent the difference between saving or losing critically wounded officers and specialists. A ship with surgical capability can keep key personnel alive who would otherwise die from their wounds. The psychological value is immense - crews fight more confidently knowing they have access to emergency surgery. Capital ships and hospital ships absolutely require surgical kits. Losing a surgical kit overboard or to damage is considered a catastrophic loss of medical capability.
