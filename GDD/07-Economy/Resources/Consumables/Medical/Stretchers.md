## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Collapsible canvas stretchers for transporting wounded personnel. Essential for moving casualties through narrow ship compartments to medical facilities.

---

## Lore

Naval stretchers are specially designed to navigate steep ladders, narrow hatches, and confined passageways. American stretchers use lightweight aluminum poles with waterproof canvas. British damage control parties drill constantly in stretcher evacuation procedures. Japanese stretchers incorporate traditional bamboo construction for lightness. German U-boat stretchers fold incredibly flat for storage in cramped quarters. Every sailor trains in proper stretcher carry techniques - two-man, four-man, and emergency one-man drags. The sound of stretcher bearers shouting "wounded coming through" is one of the distinctive calls of naval combat. Without adequate stretchers, casualties pile up at injury sites, blocking damage control efforts and increasing deaths from delayed medical treatment.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Medical Supply Depots | Medium | 5-10 units |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Medium | 2-6 units |
| Production | Medical Equipment Manufacturers | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Emergency Craft | Shipboard Workshops | Hard | 1-3 units (improvised) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Casualty Evacuation Systems, Emergency Medical Setups
- **Construction**: Required for Medical Bays (5 stretchers per bay), Casualty Collection Points (10 per station)
- **Consumable**: Enables crew evacuation (increases casualty survival during damage control by 25%), required for ship evacuation procedures
- **Trade**: Moderate demand, niche medical equipment market

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Aluminum/Wood Poles x4, Canvas x2 | Medical Equipment Assembly | Stretcher x1 | Medical Supply Manufacturer |
| Stretchers x10, Medical Bay Equipment | Installation | Complete Casualty Station | Hospital Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~172 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +40% in combat zones (high casualty rates), standard at supply ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (aluminum construction), United Kingdom (traditional canvas stretchers), Japan (bamboo variants), all nations (local production)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, medical facilities, damage control teams, casualty stations
- **Bottlenecks**: Aluminum/wood pole production, waterproof canvas availability, folding hardware manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Stretchers are essential but often overlooked until needed urgently. Ships without adequate stretchers experience bottlenecks in casualty evacuation, leading to preventable deaths. During major engagements, every stretcher is in constant use. The difference between having enough stretchers and not having them can mean dozens of additional casualties from delayed medical treatment. Smart captains maintain stretchers at multiple damage control stations throughout the ship.
