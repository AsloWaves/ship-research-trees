## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Dried blood plasma for emergency transfusions and shock treatment. Critical for treating severe blood loss from combat wounds.

---

## Lore

Dried plasma represents one of the war's greatest medical innovations. American blood donation campaigns produce vast quantities, processed into stable dried form for naval use. British sailors receive plasma shipments from the United States under Lend-Lease. The plasma comes in distinctive bottles with instructions for reconstitution with sterile water. Japanese forces lack equivalent blood banking infrastructure, relying on whole blood donors aboard ship - a far less efficient system. German U-boats carry limited plasma supplies, enough for only the most critical cases. Every medical officer knows that plasma administration in the first hour after major blood loss determines survival. The ability to store plasma without refrigeration revolutionized naval medicine, making life-saving transfusions possible even on small vessels far from port.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Medical Centers | Medium | 5-12 units |
| Quest Rewards | Casualty Evacuation Missions | Hard | 8-15 units |
| Salvage | Hospital Ships | Hard | 3-8 units |
| Blood Drive Events | Major Ports | Medium | 10-20 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Advanced Trauma Kits (2x Plasma + Medical Supplies)
- **Construction**: Required for Trauma Centers (15 units per facility), Hospital Ship equipment (25 units)
- **Consumable**: Immediately treats shock and hemorrhage, restores 35% crew health, prevents death from blood loss for 60 seconds
- **Trade**: High demand in combat zones, stable prices, priority medical cargo

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Whole Blood x5, Centrifuge Processing | Blood Banking | Plasma x1 | Blood Processing Center |
| Plasma x2, Trauma Medical Supplies | Advanced Assembly | Trauma Kit x1 | Hospital Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~36 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +80% in forward combat zones, +50% in Pacific theater, standard at major US ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (blood donation programs), United Kingdom (domestic collection), Canada (expanding production)
- **Major Consumers**: Combat vessels, hospital ships, forward medical stations, trauma centers
- **Bottlenecks**: Blood donor availability, processing facility capacity, cold storage during collection phase, transport logistics

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Plasma saves lives that would otherwise be lost to shock and hemorrhage. Ships without plasma supplies experience catastrophic casualty rates during major engagements. The ability to administer plasma immediately after injury is often the difference between survival and death from blood loss. Plasma's stability without refrigeration makes it uniquely valuable for naval operations. Fleets with adequate plasma stocks can sustain higher combat tempos because they can save critically wounded crew who would otherwise perish.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - powerful shock/hemorrhage treatment justified by cost and rarity
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced healing from 40% to 35% to distinguish from penicillin's role, added 60-second death prevention buff
- **Known Issues**: May need faction-specific availability adjustments to reflect historical production disparities
