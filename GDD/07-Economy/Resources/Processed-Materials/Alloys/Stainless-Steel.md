## Description

> *Chromium-alloyed steel that resists corrosion. Essential for marine hardware exposed to salt and weather.*

## Lore

Stainless steel is the sailor's friend. Ordinary steel rusts to uselessness in the marine environment, requiring constant painting and maintenance. Stainless steel simply refuses to corrode, maintaining its strength and appearance year after year in conditions that would destroy lesser materials.

The secret is chromium - at least 10% by weight creates a self-healing oxide layer that protects the underlying metal. The resulting alloy costs more than regular steel but saves its price many times over in reduced maintenance. Deck fittings, galley equipment, and exposed hardware all benefit from stainless steel's remarkable properties.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~37 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at steel works, +25% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Advanced steel manufacturing nations
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, marine equipment manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Chromium supply, specialized production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Important for durability
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Stainless steel reduces maintenance burden significantly. Ships equipped with stainless fittings spend less time in port and more time operational. It's a force multiplier through improved availability.
