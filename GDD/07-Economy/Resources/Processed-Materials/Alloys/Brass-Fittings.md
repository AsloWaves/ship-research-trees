## Description

> *Pre-made brass hardware for plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems. Corrosion-resistant and easy to work.*

## Lore

Brass fittings are the small parts that hold ships together. Valve bodies, pipe connectors, electrical terminals, instrument housings - anywhere you need corrosion resistance and easy machining, brass is the answer. A single warship contains thousands of brass fittings, each quietly doing its job.

The alloy of copper and zinc has been trusted for centuries. It resists saltwater, machines beautifully, and can be polished to a bright shine. Naval tradition demands polished brass, and crews spend countless hours maintaining the gleaming fittings that speak of a well-run ship.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at brass works, +10% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Brass foundries worldwide
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities, general industry
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper and zinc supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential support material
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Brass fittings are unglamorous but essential. Every ship needs them, every repair requires them, and running out means work stops. They're the nuts and bolts of naval operations - cheap individually but critical in aggregate.
