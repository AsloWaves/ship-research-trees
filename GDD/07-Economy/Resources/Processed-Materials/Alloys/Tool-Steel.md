## Description

> *High-carbon alloy steel for cutting tools and dies. Holds an edge and resists wear under extreme conditions.*

---

## Lore

Tool steel is what makes everything else. The drills that bore gun barrels, the cutters that machine propeller blades, the dies that stamp shell casings - all depend on tool steel to hold their edge through thousands of operations. Without tool steel, industrial production grinds to a halt.

Creating proper tool steel requires precise control of carbon, tungsten, chromium, and vanadium content. The resulting alloy can be hardened to cut other steels while maintaining toughness against shock. A good tool steel cutter can machine a thousand parts before resharpening. A poor one fails after a hundred.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Advanced Steel Works | Medium | 4 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Medium | Standard price |
| Salvage | Machine tools | Hard | 1-4 units |
| Trade | Industrial suppliers | Medium | Moderate availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Cutting tools, drill bits, dies, punches
- **Construction**: Machine tool components
- **Consumable**: ✅ Tools wear out (gradual replacement)
- **Trade**: High industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×3 + Tungsten ×1 + Chromium ×1 | Precision Alloying | Tool Steel ×3 | Advanced Steel Works |
| Tool Steel ×2 | Heat Treatment/Grinding | Machine Tool Set ×1 | Machine Shop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~37 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at steel centers, +30% in remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Advanced industrial nations
- **Major Consumers**: Machine shops, arsenals, factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Tungsten supply, specialized heat treatment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for production
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Tool steel determines industrial capacity. Without cutting tools, factories can't operate, arsenals can't produce weapons, and shipyards can't build ships. It's the bottleneck that enables all other production.
