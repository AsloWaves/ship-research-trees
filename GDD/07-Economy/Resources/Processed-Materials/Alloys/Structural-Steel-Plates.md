## Description

> *Heavy-duty steel plating for ship hulls and structures. The backbone of naval construction.*

---

## Lore

Structural steel plates form the skeleton and skin of every ship afloat. Unlike armor plate, they're not meant to stop shells - they're meant to keep the sea out and the ship together. Every frame, every deck, every bulkhead depends on structural steel.

The quality of structural steel determines how long a ship will serve. Good plates resist corrosion, maintain strength under stress, and can be welded or riveted reliably. Poor plates mean leaks, cracks, and ships that fall apart under strain. Naval architects obsess over steel quality because they know lives depend on it.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for ship construction
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Structural steel is the foundation of naval power. Without it, no ships get built, no repairs get made, no fleets get expanded. It's less glamorous than armor plate but equally essential.
