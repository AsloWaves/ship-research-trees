## Description

> *High-carbon iron for engine blocks, ballast, and heavy castings. Cheap, heavy, and easy to cast into complex shapes.*

---

## Lore

Cast iron is the workhorse metal of industry. It melts at lower temperatures than steel, flows into complex molds beautifully, and produces strong, rigid parts at low cost. Engine blocks, cylinder heads, ballast weights, and machinery housings all start as molten cast iron poured into sand molds.

The material's high carbon content makes it brittle compared to steel, but for applications where weight and rigidity matter more than toughness, cast iron excels. It machines well, dampens vibration, and costs a fraction of steel alternatives. Every foundry can produce cast iron, making it universally available.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Support material
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Cast iron is abundant and cheap but essential for heavy industry. It won't win battles directly, but the engines and machinery that power warships depend on cast iron components. Disrupting foundry production affects everything downstream.
