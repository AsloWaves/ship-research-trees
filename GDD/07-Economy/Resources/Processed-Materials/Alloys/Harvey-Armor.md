## Description

> *Face-hardened armor using the Harvey process. Older technology but still effective against lighter weapons.*

---

## Lore

Harvey armor represents the first generation of face-hardened naval armor. The process sprays liquid steel onto heated plates, then rapidly quenches them, creating a hard face backed by tough steel. The result deflects shells that would punch through ordinary armor.

While superseded by Krupp cemented armor for main belt protection, Harvey armor remains valuable for secondary protection and older vessels. It's cheaper to produce and still stops anything but the heaviest shells. Many captains prefer Harvey armor for cruiser-weight ships where cost matters as much as protection.

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Armor Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major naval bases | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Older warships | Medium | 3-6 units |
| Trade | Military contractors | Hard | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Cruiser armor, secondary protection, legacy repairs
- **Construction**: Armor belts, turret faces, conning towers
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Moderate military demand

### Processing & Refinement

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~315 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at armor works, +30% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Traditional armor manufacturers
- **Major Consumers**: Cruiser construction, older ship repairs
- **Bottlenecks**: Skilled labor, base armor plate supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for cruiser protection
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Harvey armor fills the gap between standard armor plate and premium Krupp armor. It provides excellent protection at reasonable cost, making it ideal for light cruisers and auxiliary vessels where weight and expense must be balanced against protection.
