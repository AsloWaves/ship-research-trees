## Description

> *Premium face-hardened armor using Krupp's cementation process. The gold standard of naval protection.*

---

## Lore

Krupp cemented armor represents the pinnacle of naval protection technology. The cementation process diffuses carbon into the plate's surface at extreme temperatures, creating a glass-hard face backed by tough, ductile steel. Shells shatter against the face while the backing absorbs the impact.

This armor protects the most powerful warships afloat. Battleship main belts, turret faces, and conning towers all rely on Krupp armor to keep their crews alive. The process is difficult and expensive, requiring weeks of careful heat treatment, but nothing else offers the same protection for the weight.
