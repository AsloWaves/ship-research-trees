## Description

> *Steel fasteners for permanent metal joints. The pins that hold ships together, one at a time.*

---

## Lore

Before welding became widespread, rivets held ships together. Millions of them, hammered red-hot into pre-drilled holes, expanding as they cooled to create watertight joints. A battleship might contain over a million rivets, each one driven by skilled workers in deafening shipyard noise.

Even with welding's rise, rivets remain essential for many applications. They're stronger than bolts in shear, more reliable in vibration, and easier to inspect. Experienced shipwrights can tell a good rivet from a bad one by sound alone - the solid ring of a properly set rivet versus the dull thud of a loose one.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Fastener Factory | Easy | 50 per batch |
| Purchase | Any port | Easy | Very cheap |
| Salvage | Ship structures | Easy | 20-100 units |
| Trade | Industrial suppliers | Easy | Bulk available |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Hull assemblies, structural joints, armor mounting
- **Construction**: Ship building, repairs, modifications
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Universal shipyard demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×1 | Forging | Rivets ×20 | Fastener Factory |
| Rivets ×50 | Assembly | Hull Section Component ×1 | Shipyard |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - universally available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Any industrial nation
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards worldwide
- **Bottlenecks**: Rarely constrained - mass production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Basic construction material
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Rivets are the most basic of shipbuilding components, but running out stops construction cold. They're cheap enough to stockpile in huge quantities, and wise quartermasters always maintain generous reserves.
