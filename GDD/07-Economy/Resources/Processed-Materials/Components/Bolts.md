## Description

> *Threaded steel fasteners for removable connections. Essential hardware for machinery and equipment mounting.*

---

## Lore

Where rivets make permanent joints, bolts make removable ones. Every piece of equipment that might need service, every panel that might need access, every component that might need replacement is held in place by bolts. The threading that makes them removable also makes them stronger in tension.

Naval bolts must be precisely sized and threaded to standard specifications. A mismatched bolt can strip threads, fail under stress, or simply not fit. Smart engineers keep comprehensive bolt inventories sorted by size, thread pitch, and head type. Finding the right bolt saves hours of fabrication.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - universally available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Any industrial nation
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Rarely constrained

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Basic hardware
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Bolts are humble but essential. Every repair, every installation, every modification requires proper bolts. Running short means improvisation that can compromise equipment reliability.
