## Description

> *Massive forged steel shafts that convert piston motion to rotation. The irreplaceable heart of every reciprocating engine.*

---

## Lore

Crankshafts are engineering marvels - complex shapes forged from single billets of the finest steel, machined to microscopic tolerances, then heat-treated and balanced to perfection. They convert the linear thrust of pistons into the rotary motion that drives ships. A naval diesel crankshaft might weigh a ton yet be balanced to fractions of an ounce.

There is no quick fix for a broken crankshaft. It cannot be welded, cannot be patched, cannot be bypassed. A crankshaft failure means the engine is dead until a replacement arrives - and replacements take months to manufacture. Wise captains treat their crankshafts with the respect they deserve.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1800 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at heavy industry, +50% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Only major industrial powers
- **Major Consumers**: Diesel engine production, major repairs
- **Bottlenecks**: Heavy forge capacity, precision expertise

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Irreplaceable engine component
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Crankshafts represent the ultimate industrial capability. Only nations with the most advanced heavy industry can manufacture them. A crankshaft shortage can strand entire fleets of diesel-powered vessels.
