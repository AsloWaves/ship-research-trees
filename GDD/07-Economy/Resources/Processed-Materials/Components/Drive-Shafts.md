## Description

> *Precision-forged steel shafts for transmitting power from engines to propellers. The backbone of ship propulsion.*

---

## Lore

Drive shafts transmit thousands of horsepower from engines to propellers. They must spin true at hundreds of RPM for years on end, withstanding enormous torque while maintaining perfect alignment. A battleship's propeller shafts might be over a hundred feet long and weigh dozens of tons, yet must be balanced to exacting precision.

Manufacturing drive shafts requires the finest steel, forged and machined to tolerances measured in thousandths of an inch. A bent shaft creates vibration that can shake a ship apart. A broken shaft means dead in the water. These critical components represent the pinnacle of heavy precision engineering.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~225 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at heavy industry centers, +40% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Major industrial powers with heavy forge capability
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ship construction and repair
- **Bottlenecks**: Heavy forge capacity, precision machining

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Critical propulsion component
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Drive shafts are among the most critical and difficult-to-replace ship components. Damage to a shaft can put a vessel out of action for months. Only nations with heavy industrial capability can produce them.
