## Description

> *Flux-coated steel electrodes for arc welding. The consumable heart of modern shipbuilding.*

---

## Lore

Welding revolutionized shipbuilding. Where riveting required teams of workers and days of labor, welding could join steel in minutes with stronger, watertight seams. Welding rods are the consumable that makes it possible - steel wire coated in flux that shields the molten metal from contamination.

The coating matters as much as the core. Different flux compositions suit different steels and positions. Good welders know which rod to use for each situation and can feel when a rod is running properly by the arc's sound. A ship's strength depends on thousands of welds, each one a tiny battlefield between skill and metallurgy.
