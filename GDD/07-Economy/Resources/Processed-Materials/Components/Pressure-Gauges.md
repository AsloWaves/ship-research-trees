## Description

> *Precision instruments for measuring steam, hydraulic, and pneumatic pressure. The eyes that watch every pressure system.*

---

## Lore

Pressure gauges are the silent sentinels of ship systems. They watch steam lines for dangerous overpressure, monitor hydraulic systems for leaks, and track pneumatic stores for depletion. Without them, operators work blind, unable to detect problems until they become catastrophes.

Inside each gauge, a curved Bourdon tube straightens under pressure, moving a needle across a calibrated dial. It's a simple, reliable mechanism that converts invisible pressure into visible reading. Calibration must be precise - an inaccurate gauge is worse than none at all, providing false confidence while danger builds.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~27 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at instrument works, +20% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Precision instrument manufacturers
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, control system builders
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision manufacturing, glass supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential safety equipment
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Pressure gauges are critical for safe operations. A ship without working gauges cannot safely operate its boilers, hydraulics, or pneumatics. They're relatively common but must be treated as essential equipment.
