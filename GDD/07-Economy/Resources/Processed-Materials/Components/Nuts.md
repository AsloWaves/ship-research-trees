## Description

> *Threaded fasteners that pair with bolts. Small but essential for secure connections.*

## Lore

Nuts are the other half of the bolt equation. Without the nut to draw down on the bolt threads, you have no clamping force, no secure joint, no reliable connection. They seem trivial until you're missing the right size and have to fabricate one by hand.

Naval nuts come in countless sizes and configurations - hex nuts, lock nuts, castle nuts, wing nuts. Each has its purpose. Lock nuts resist vibration loosening. Castle nuts accept cotter pins for positive locking. The right nut for the job means the difference between reliable equipment and dangerous failures.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - universally available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Any industrial nation
- **Major Consumers**: All mechanical operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Rarely constrained

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Basic hardware
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Nuts are among the most basic industrial components, but their absence stops work. Smart mechanics keep organized inventories sorted by size and type.
