## Description

> *Hardened steel sleeves for engine cylinders. The wear surface that takes the punishment of combustion.*

---

## Lore

Cylinder liners are the expendable armor of engines. These hardened steel sleeves line the engine block, providing the smooth, hard surface against which pistons slide. They absorb the wear and corrosion of thousands of combustion cycles, protecting the expensive engine block from damage.

When liners wear out, they can be replaced without scrapping the entire engine. This simple but critical feature makes liner engines far more maintainable than solid-block designs. A skilled engine crew can replace cylinder liners at sea, restoring a worn engine to like-new condition without a shipyard visit.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~43 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at engine works, +25% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Engine manufacturing nations
- **Major Consumers**: Engine overhaul facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Tool steel supply, precision boring

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for engine maintenance
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Cylinder liners are the key to sustainable engine operations. With liners, an engine can be rebuilt indefinitely. Without them, a worn engine must be scrapped. Liner supply determines diesel fleet sustainability.
