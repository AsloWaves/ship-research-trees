## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Naval telescopes for long-range observation and celestial navigation. Higher magnification than binoculars for detailed examination of distant vessels and coastal features.

---

## Lore

While binoculars dominated close-range naval observation, telescopes filled specialized roles requiring higher magnification or stabilized viewing. Bridge-mounted telescopes on battleships and cruisers allowed officers to examine distant vessels for identification purposes—distinguishing friend from foe at extreme ranges often meant the difference between opening fire or holding position. Their longer tubes and higher magnification (typically 15x to 30x) made them unsuitable for hand-held use, but when properly mounted they revealed details invisible to binoculars.

British warships traditionally carried multiple telescopes mounted at fixed stations around the bridge and flag platforms. During the hunt for Bismarck, telescope-equipped lookouts aboard HMS Norfolk maintained visual contact despite heavy seas that made binocular observation nearly impossible. The stabilized mounts damped out ship motion, allowing continuous observation even in rough weather. Japanese cruisers used specialized night telescopes with large objective lenses for surface observation during their devastating night actions in the Solomons.

Naval telescopes also served astronomical navigation purposes. Despite radio direction finding and early radar, celestial navigation remained the primary means of determining position at sea. Navigation officers used telescopes to shoot star sights when standard sextants couldn't provide sufficient magnification or stability. German surface raiders operating in the Indian Ocean relied heavily on astronomical navigation to avoid detection, making telescopes as critical as their main armament for successful cruise operations.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Optical instrument workshops | Medium-High | 2-6 units |
| Purchase | Naval suppliers, specialized optical shops | Medium | 1-10 units |
| Salvage | Damaged bridge equipment, captured vessels | Medium | 1-3 units |
| Quest Reward | Navigation and observation missions | Medium | 2-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not typically crafted further; specialized end-use equipment
- **Construction**: Bridge observation stations, flag platforms, coastal defense posts, astronomical navigation equipment
- **Consumable**: Fixed installation or specialized use equipment; enables long-range identification and navigation
- **Trade**: Moderate demand from larger vessels and shore establishments; specialized market

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Lenses (6 units), Optical Glass (2 units), Tube assembly | Precision assembly | Telescopes (1 unit) | Optical Workshop |
| Telescopes, Stabilized mount | Integration | Bridge Telescope Station | Ship fitting facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~172 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low-Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +35% at forward bases, +20% in remote areas, -5% at major naval ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: UK (long nautical telescope tradition), Germany (Zeiss quality), USA (adequate wartime production), Japan (limited specialized production)
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ships, cruisers, coastal defense stations, navigation departments, astronomical observers
- **Bottlenecks**: High-magnification lens production, precision tube manufacturing, mounting hardware availability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Telescopes provide capabilities that binoculars cannot match—long-range identification, detailed examination of distant objects, and astronomical navigation support. While not essential for basic operations, vessels equipped with quality telescopes gain significant advantages in detection range and target identification, particularly in the identification-before-engagement scenarios common in surface warfare.
