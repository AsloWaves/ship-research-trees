## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Experimental infrared detection equipment for night operations. Cutting-edge WW2 technology that provides significant tactical advantage in darkness.

---

## Lore

Night vision technology in WW2 was in its infancy, with only the most advanced navies experimenting with infrared detection systems. German forces pioneered active infrared systems with the Vampir devices, while Allied forces developed passive light amplification technologies. These rare devices could mean the difference between detecting an enemy formation first or being caught in a devastating night ambush. Naval commanders prize them for convoy escort operations and night surface actions. The technology is so secret that recovery operations often include intelligence officers to prevent enemy capture. Most units are prototypes or small production runs, making functional examples extraordinarily valuable.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Elite vessel wrecks | Very Hard | 1 unit |
| Special Missions | Intelligence operations | Hard | 1 unit |
| Rare Drop | High-level enemy captains | Very Hard | 1 unit |
| Black Market | Major ports (rare spawn) | N/A | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for night combat systems, advanced bridge equipment, experimental torpedo directors
- **Construction**: Elite destroyer/cruiser night-fighting configurations, submarine periscopes
- **Consumable**: Grants temporary night vision bonus when activated (limited battery life)
- **Trade**: Extreme value in black markets, intelligence services will pay premiums, rare broker-only commodity

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Advanced Electronics x2, Specialized Glass x3, Rare Earth Elements x1 | Prototype Assembly | Night Vision Optics x1 | Research Facility |
| Damaged Night Vision x1, Advanced Electronics x1 | Restoration | Night Vision Optics x1 | Intelligence Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1916 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Extreme - +200% in theaters with night operations, unavailable in many regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Infrared), USA (Image Intensification - experimental), UK (Research units)
- **Major Consumers**: Intelligence services, elite naval units, special operations groups
- **Bottlenecks**: Rare earth elements, specialized glass production, security clearances, prototype manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Night vision technology represents game-changing tactical superiority. Ships equipped with these systems can detect enemies first in darkness, coordinate night torpedo attacks with precision, or avoid ambushes entirely. The technology is so valuable that some commanders refuse night engagements without it. Black market prices can reach 5x normal value. Nations actively sabotage each other's research facilities and hunt for prototypes. Possession of enemy night vision devices can provide intelligence on opposing technology advancement, making them targets for espionage.
