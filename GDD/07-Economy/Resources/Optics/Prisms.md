## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision-cut optical prisms for periscopes, rangefinders, and fire control systems. Essential components that redirect and split light paths in complex naval optical instruments.

## Lore

Optical prisms represented one of the most challenging manufacturing feats in naval optics. Unlike simple lenses, prisms required perfectly flat surfaces ground to exacting angles—any deviation of even a fraction of a degree would render a rangefinder or periscope useless. German optical houses pioneered the total internal reflection prisms used in submarine periscopes, allowing submariners to observe the surface while remaining deep enough to avoid detection.

The Porro prism design, perfected in the early 1900s, became standard in naval binoculars and periscopes because it could fold the light path multiple times within a compact housing. This allowed rangefinders to achieve effective base lengths of 15 meters while fitting within turret dimensions. British fire control systems on Nelson-class battleships used complex prism assemblies with up to eight separate elements, each ground to tolerances of one wavelength of light.

During the war, prism production became a critical bottleneck. Each capital ship required hundreds of prisms across its various optical systems, and combat damage frequently shattered these precision elements. The Japanese Navy's shortage of prism-grinding facilities meant that damaged fire control systems often couldn't be repaired at forward bases, forcing ships back to home waters for months. American submarine crews learned to carry spare periscope prisms as high-priority items—a single cracked prism could force a boat to abort its patrol, rendering months of positioning worthless.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Optical manufacturing facilities with precision grinding | High | 4-8 units |
| Purchase | Specialized optical suppliers, naval arsenals | Medium | 1-15 units |
| Salvage | Damaged optical instruments, fire control equipment | High | 1-3 units |
| Quest Reward | Optical system upgrade missions | Medium | 3-6 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Periscope Optics, Rangefinder Elements, Binoculars, Night Vision Optics
- **Construction**: Submarine periscopes, fire control directors, optical rangefinders, observation equipment
- **Consumable**: Used as precision replacement parts for damaged optical systems
- **Trade**: High demand from submarine forces and capital ship operators; premium prices at repair facilities

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | +60% in Pacific forward bases, +40% at submarine repair facilities, -10% near German/US manufacturing centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss, Carl Zeiss Jena), USA (Bausch & Lomb, Eastman Kodak), UK (Barr & Stroud), Japan (limited domestic capacity)
- **Major Consumers**: Submarine forces, battleship fire control departments, cruiser gunnery systems, naval repair yards
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision angle-grinding equipment, skilled optical technicians, long processing times, high rejection rates from quality control

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Prisms are irreplaceable components in submarine periscopes and fire control rangefinders. Without properly functioning prisms, submarines cannot operate safely, battleships lose their long-range gunnery advantage, and destroyers cannot accurately engage targets beyond point-blank range. The extreme precision required for prism manufacturing creates production bottlenecks that cannot be overcome through mass production alone, making damaged prisms nearly impossible to replace at forward bases.
