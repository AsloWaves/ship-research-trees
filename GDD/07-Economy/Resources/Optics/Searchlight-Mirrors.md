## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Large parabolic mirrors from naval searchlights. Essential for illuminating targets during night surface actions and signaling.

---

## Lore

Searchlights are essential equipment for night naval combat, using powerful carbon arc lamps and precision-ground parabolic mirrors to illuminate targets at extreme range. Every destroyer carries at least two searchlights, while capital ships mount dozens for anti-aircraft defense and surface gunnery. The mirrors themselves are precision optical components, carefully silvered and calibrated to produce tight, powerful beams that can reach out thousands of yards. Damaged mirrors from battle or age scatter light inefficiently, reducing range and effectiveness. Salvaged mirrors in good condition command premium prices from repair facilities maintaining wartime searchlight batteries.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Destroyer/Cruiser wrecks | Medium | 1-3 units |
| Looting | Damaged searchlight mounts | Easy | 1 unit |
| Purchase | Port merchants | N/A | Common stock |
| Scavenging | Coastal installations | Medium | 2-4 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for searchlight assemblies, signal lamp systems, anti-aircraft searchlight batteries
- **Construction**: Essential for destroyer and larger vessel lighting systems, coastal defense installations
- **Consumable**: Not consumed, but degrades over time requiring replacement
- **Trade**: Moderate value, steady demand from repair facilities and new construction

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Optical Glass x2, Silver Plating x1 | Mirror Fabrication | Searchlight Mirrors x1 | Optical Workshop |
| Tarnished Mirror x2, Silver Plating x1 | Resilvering | Searchlight Mirrors x1 | Repair Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~187 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +30% in active combat zones, +20% Pacific theater (night operations), -10% home ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All major naval powers, specialized optical manufacturers
- **Major Consumers**: Naval shipyards, repair facilities, anti-aircraft battery installations
- **Bottlenecks**: High-quality optical glass, silver for plating, precision grinding equipment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Searchlight mirrors are tactically important but not strategically critical. Night surface actions depend heavily on searchlights for target acquisition before radar becomes widespread. Anti-aircraft batteries require searchlights for night fighter direction. However, mirrors are relatively common and can be manufactured with existing optical industry capacity. Their importance spikes in theaters with frequent night operations, particularly the Pacific where nocturnal surface actions are common. Salvage operations often strip searchlights entirely rather than just mirrors due to integrated assembly value.
