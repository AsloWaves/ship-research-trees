## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Complete optical rangefinder assemblies for naval fire control systems. Precisely calibrated components that enable accurate range determination at distances exceeding 30,000 yards.

## Lore

The stereoscopic rangefinder revolutionized naval gunnery by allowing ships to accurately determine target distance beyond visual estimation limits. By splitting incoming light and presenting two images separated by a precise base length—typically 4.5 to 15 meters on capital ships—trained operators could achieve range accuracy within 50 yards at 20,000-yard distances. The Battle of Jutland demonstrated that German rangefinders, with their superior Zeiss optics and longer base lengths, consistently outperformed British equipment, allowing German battlecruisers to score hits before their opponents could accurately return fire.

Rangefinder manufacturing required extraordinary precision. The two objective lenses at each end of the instrument had to be perfectly parallel and precisely spaced. Any deviation, thermal expansion, or shock from gunnery could throw off calibration by hundreds of yards. American battleships in the Pacific learned this lesson when main battery salvos would jar their own rangefinders out of alignment, forcing gunnery officers to recalibrate between salvos. Japanese rangefinders incorporated sophisticated compensating mechanisms to counter this problem, but their complexity made field repairs nearly impossible.

The strategic value of rangefinder elements cannot be overstated. Battleships like HMS Hood carried multiple rangefinders—one atop the director control tower, additional units in B-turret and the aft control position. Each element represented months of specialized manufacturing and cost more than a destroyer's entire optical suite. When Bismarck's second salvo struck Hood's boat deck, it likely damaged her forward rangefinder elements, degrading her return fire accuracy in those critical final minutes. Salvage teams specifically targeted rangefinder assemblies from sunken vessels, and intelligence services paid fortunes for captured examples to reverse-engineer enemy optical technology.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Advanced optical manufacturing facilities | Very High | 1-2 units |
| Purchase | Major naval arsenals, capital ship yards | High | 1-5 units |
| Salvage | Damaged capital ships, captured fire control equipment | Very High | 1 unit |
| Quest Reward | Major fire control upgrade missions | High | 1-3 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not typically used for further crafting; end-product component
- **Construction**: Fire control director systems, main battery fire control, secondary battery directors, cruiser and battleship gunnery systems
- **Consumable**: Direct installation as critical fire control component; enables long-range accurate gunnery
- **Trade**: Extremely high value; limited availability; primarily traded between major naval powers or through intelligence channels

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Lenses (8 units), Prisms (4 units), Mirrors (2 units) | Precision assembly & calibration | Rangefinder Elements (1 unit) | Capital Ship Equipment Facility |
| Rangefinder Elements (2 units), Fire control computer | Integration & testing | Fire Control Director (1 unit) | Naval Arsenal |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1200 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | +100% in Pacific forward areas, +80% at repair facilities, +50% for damaged units requiring recalibration, -20% at major German/US naval arsenals |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss, world-leading quality), USA (numerous manufacturers for wartime production), UK (Barr & Stroud, high precision), Japan (limited production for capital ships only)
- **Major Consumers**: Battleships (multiple units per vessel), heavy cruisers (2-3 units per ship), light cruisers (1-2 units), fire control upgrade programs
- **Bottlenecks**: Months-long manufacturing time per unit, extreme precision requirements, skilled optical engineers for calibration, testing facilities with sufficient range, post-combat recalibration requirements

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Rangefinder elements are the single most critical optical component for capital ship combat effectiveness. Without functional rangefinders, battleships and cruisers lose their ability to engage targets beyond 15,000 yards, negating their main armament advantage. A ship with damaged rangefinders becomes a liability to its task force, unable to contribute to long-range gunnery duels. The extreme manufacturing difficulty and months-long production time make replacements essentially unobtainable at forward bases, often forcing damaged capital ships to return to home ports for repairs that can take months.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Limited | Base price | Multiple manufacturers but still production-limited; adequate quality |
| United Kingdom | Scarce | +15% | Barr & Stroud monopoly; excellent quality but limited production capacity |
| Japan | Very Scarce | +60% | Insufficient production for fleet needs; prioritized for battleships only |
| Germany | Limited | -15% | Zeiss excellence but Allied bombing disrupts production; finest optical quality available |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - extremely high value reflects critical military importance and manufacturing difficulty
- **Adjustment History**: Base value increased from 850 to 1200 credits to properly represent strategic significance; stack limit set to 5 to emphasize rarity
- **Known Issues**: May need mission/quest availability to prevent players from being completely unable to repair capital ship fire control; Japan's +60% modifier could be punishing
