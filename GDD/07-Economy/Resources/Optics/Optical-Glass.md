## Lore

The development of high-quality optical glass revolutionized naval warfare in the early 20th century. Before the war, Germany's Zeiss and Schott manufacturers dominated the global market for precision optical glass, forcing Allied nations to rapidly develop domestic production capabilities when war broke out. The quality of optical glass directly impacts the maximum effective range of fire control systems—British battleships at Jutland learned this lesson when German rangefinders consistently achieved first hits at ranges exceeding 20,000 yards.

By 1940, American manufacturers like Bausch & Lomb and Eastman Kodak had scaled up production to meet wartime demand, but quality optical glass remained a strategic bottleneck. Each battleship's main fire control director required dozens of precision lens elements, while rangefinders on capital ships used optical paths up to 15 meters long. Japan's limited domestic optical glass production forced their naval designers to prioritize capital ships and cruisers, often leaving destroyers and submarines with inferior optics.

The shortage of optical glass became so severe that salvage operations specifically targeted fire control equipment from sunken vessels. A single intact rangefinder assembly from a damaged cruiser could be worth more than the ship's armor plate, and intelligence services paid premium prices for captured enemy optical systems to analyze their manufacturing techniques.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Optical Manufacturing Facilities | Medium | 5-10 units |
| Purchase | Major naval bases, specialized suppliers | Low | 1-20 units |
| Salvage | Damaged fire control systems | High | 1-3 units |
| Quest Reward | Research & Development missions | Medium | 3-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Rangefinder Elements, Periscope Optics, Lenses, Prisms, Binoculars, Telescopes
- **Construction**: Fire control systems, optical rangefinders, submarine periscopes, naval observation equipment
- **Consumable**: Not directly consumable; used in crafting only
- **Trade**: High demand from all naval factions; stable prices in major ports, premium prices at forward bases

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Raw silica, rare earth oxides | Precision melting & annealing | Optical Glass | Optical Manufacturing Facility |
| Optical Glass (5 units) | Grinding & polishing | Lenses (3 units) | Precision Workshop |
| Optical Glass (3 units) | Cutting & coating | Prisms (4 units) | Optical Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~27 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +40% in Pacific theater, +25% at forward bases, -15% near manufacturing centers (Germany, USA) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss/Schott), USA (Bausch & Lomb, Eastman Kodak), UK (Chance Brothers), Japan (limited production)
- **Major Consumers**: Naval dockyards, fire control system manufacturers, submarine yards, optical instrument makers
- **Bottlenecks**: Specialized furnaces for melting, rare earth oxide imports, skilled craftsmen, long annealing times (weeks)

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Optical glass is the foundation of modern naval fire control. Without high-quality optical glass, battleships cannot engage targets beyond visual range, submarines cannot safely operate their periscopes, and cruisers lose their gunnery advantage. Nations with superior optical glass production can field more accurate fire control systems, directly translating to higher hit rates and combat effectiveness. The resource's scarcity makes it a priority target for strategic bombing and a high-value commodity in neutral ports.
