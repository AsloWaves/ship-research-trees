## Description

> *Active sonar projectors for underwater detection. They send the pings that find submarines hiding in the deep.*

---

## Lore

Sonar transducers are the voice of active sonar systems. They convert electrical pulses into powerful sound waves that propagate through water, bounce off submarines, and return as echoes. The same transducers that send the ping also receive the echo, converting sound back into electrical signals that operators can interpret.

Active sonar is a double-edged sword. The pings that find submarines also advertise the hunter's position. Submarines hear active sonar from far greater ranges than the sonar can detect them. Skilled escort commanders balance the detection advantage of active sonar against the risk of alerting U-boats to their presence.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~375 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at sonar facilities, +35% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom
- **Major Consumers**: Escort vessels, destroyers
- **Bottlenecks**: Piezoelectric materials, precision manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Critical for ASW
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Sonar transducers enable active submarine detection. While passive hydrophones listen, active sonar can range targets precisely and detect stationary submarines. Escort groups depend on active sonar for attack guidance.
