## Description

> *Captured cipher machine components of immense intelligence value. The keys to reading enemy secrets.*

---

## Lore

Enigma components represent the most valuable intelligence assets of the war. Cipher machines like Enigma protect enemy communications with seemingly unbreakable codes. Capturing rotors, codebooks, or the machines themselves provides intelligence services with the keys to unlock those secrets.

The value of captured cipher material is almost impossible to overstate. Breaking enemy codes reveals fleet movements, submarine positions, convoy schedules, and strategic intentions. A single captured codebook can save thousands of lives and sink dozens of ships. The enemy protects their cipher equipment fanatically - capture attempts are dangerous and often fatal.
