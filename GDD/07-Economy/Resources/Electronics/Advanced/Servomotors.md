## Description

> *Precision electric motors for fire control and positioning systems. They put guns where computations say they should be.*

## Lore

Servomotors are the muscles of fire control systems. When fire control computers calculate the correct gun elevation and bearing, servomotors move massive gun mounts to precisely match those calculations. The motors must be powerful enough to move tons of steel, yet precise enough to position to fractions of a degree.

The feedback loop is critical. As servomotors move the guns, position sensors report actual location back to the computer, which adjusts commands until actual position matches calculated position. This constant correction happens dozens of times per second, keeping guns on target despite ship motion and target movement. Without servos, fire control computers would be useless calculators with no way to aim the guns.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~375 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at fire control facilities, +40% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom, Germany
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ship construction and repair
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision manufacturing, motor quality

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for automated fire control
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Servomotors enable the rapid, accurate gun laying that modern fire control demands. Without them, guns must be manually trained, eliminating the advantage of sophisticated fire control computers. Servo failure can disable entire gun batteries.
