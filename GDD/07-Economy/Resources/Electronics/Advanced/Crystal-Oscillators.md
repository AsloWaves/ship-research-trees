## Description

> *Quartz crystals precisely cut for frequency control. The heartbeat of every radio and radar.*

---

## Lore

Crystal oscillators provide the stable frequencies that make reliable radio communication possible. A slice of quartz, cut at precise angles and polished to exact dimensions, vibrates at a specific frequency when electricity passes through it. This piezoelectric property creates the stable reference signals that all radio and radar equipment depends on.

Each crystal is manufactured for a specific frequency. Radio operators must have the correct crystals to communicate on assigned channels. Losing a crystal means losing access to that frequency. Ships carry sets of crystals for all their assigned frequencies, and crystal control creates the radio discipline that prevents chaos on the airwaves.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Crystal Works | Medium | 4 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Medium | Standard price |
| Salvage | Radio equipment | Medium | 1-3 units |
| Trade | Electronics suppliers | Medium | Moderate availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Radio transmitters, radar timing circuits
- **Construction**: Communication systems
- **Consumable**: N/A (if handled properly)
- **Trade**: Good demand for radio operations

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Quartz ×2 + Brass Fittings ×1 | Precision Cutting | Crystal Oscillators ×3 | Crystal Works |
| Crystal Oscillators ×2 + Vacuum Tubes ×4 | Assembly | Radio Transmitter ×1 | Electronics Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~52 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at crystal works, +25% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, Germany (precision industry)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval communications
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision cutting equipment, quality quartz

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for communications
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Crystal oscillators control radio frequencies. Without the right crystals, a ship cannot communicate on assigned channels. Frequency-hopping and secure communications depend on having complete sets of matched crystals.
