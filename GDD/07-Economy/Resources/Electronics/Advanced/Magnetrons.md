## Description

> *Cavity magnetrons for microwave radar generation. The secret heart of Allied radar superiority.*

---

## Lore

The cavity magnetron revolutionized radar warfare. This compact device generates powerful microwave pulses at centimetric wavelengths, enabling radar sets small enough to fit on aircraft and precise enough to detect periscopes and submarine conning towers. Allied magnetron technology represents one of the most closely guarded secrets of the war.

Inside each magnetron, electrons spiral through magnetic fields, passing resonant cavities that extract microwave energy with remarkable efficiency. The British invention was shared with America in one of the most significant technology transfers in history. Axis powers struggle to match this capability, their longer-wavelength radars unable to detect the small targets that centimetric radar reveals.
