## Description

> *Complete radio transmitter and receiver assemblies. The voice that reaches across the ocean.*

## Lore

Radio equipment connects ships to the world beyond the horizon. Transmitters convert voice and code into electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of light. Receivers pluck those same waves from the air and convert them back into intelligible signals. Radio is the lifeline of naval operations, carrying orders from admirals, reports from scouts, and distress calls from the doomed.

Naval radio equipment must withstand the maritime environment - salt spray, humidity, vibration, and the electromagnetic chaos of a fighting ship. Military radios are built robust and redundant, with backup systems and spare parts. A ship that loses all radio capability is isolated and vulnerable, unable to call for help or receive warnings.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Electronics Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major ports | Hard | Standard price |
| Salvage | Ship communications | Medium | 0-1 units |
| Trade | Communications suppliers | Medium | Moderate availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Ship communication systems
- **Construction**: Radio rooms, communication centers
- **Consumable**: ✅ Tubes and components wear out
- **Trade**: Universal demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Amplifier Tubes ×4 + Crystal Oscillators ×2 + Transformers ×2 | Assembly | Radio Equipment ×1 | Electronics Works |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~405 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at production centers, +30% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All major industrial nations
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels
- **Bottlenecks**: Vacuum tubes, quality components

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for command and control
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Radio equipment is essential for naval operations. Without radio, ships cannot receive orders, report contacts, or coordinate with other vessels. Radio failure isolates a ship from the fleet.
