## Description

> *Mechanical and electromechanical computing systems for gunnery solutions. The brain that turns target data into hits.*

---

## Lore

Fire control computers are the most sophisticated calculating machines afloat. They take inputs - target bearing, range, speed, and course; own ship's motion; wind, temperature, and barrel wear - and produce outputs that tell the guns exactly where to point. What would take trained gunners minutes of calculation, the computer solves continuously in real time.

Inside these remarkable machines, cams, gears, differential analyzers, and resolvers work in precise mechanical harmony. Some newer versions use vacuum tubes for certain calculations, adding electronic speed to mechanical precision. The complexity is staggering - a single fire control computer contains thousands of components, each essential to accurate solutions.
