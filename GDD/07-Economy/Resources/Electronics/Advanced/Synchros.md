## Description

> *Electromechanical position transmitters for remote indication. They tell distant stations exactly where things are pointing.*

---

## Lore

Synchros transmit position information electrically across ships. When a gun director trains on a target, synchros send that bearing to gun mounts throughout the ship. When a rangefinder measures distance, synchros relay that information to fire control computers. Synchros are the nerves of fire control systems, carrying position data wherever it's needed.

The synchro system is elegantly simple. A transmitter converts mechanical position to electrical signals. Receivers anywhere on the ship convert those signals back to mechanical position. No matter how far apart, transmitter and receiver stay synchronized to fractions of a degree. Without synchros, fire control would require shouted orders and manual relay.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Fire Control Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Naval electronics centers | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Fire control systems | Hard | 0-2 units |

- **Construction**: Integrated weapon systems
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Critical for capital ship systems

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~345 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at fire control facilities, +40% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom, Germany
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ship construction and repair
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision manufacturing, calibration

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for integrated fire control
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Synchros enable coordinated fire control across large ships. Without them, each gun station would need its own rangefinder and director. Synchro failure breaks the connection between directors and guns, severely degrading fire control capability.
