## Description

> *Underwater listening devices for passive sonar. They hear the sounds that submarines try to hide.*

---

## Lore

Hydrophones are underwater microphones, listening for the sounds that betray submarine presence - propeller noise, machinery hum, hull creaks, and the distinctive pings of active sonar. Passive listening reveals enemies without betraying the listener's position, making hydrophones the foundation of anti-submarine warfare.

Skilled sonar operators develop remarkable abilities to identify sounds. They recognize individual submarines by their acoustic signatures, distinguish between surface ships and submerged threats, and locate targets by the direction and quality of sounds. The hydrophone is only as good as the operator who interprets its signals, but without the hydrophone, the operator is deaf.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Sonar Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Anti-submarine bases | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | ASW vessels | Medium | 0-2 units |
| Trade | Naval suppliers | Hard | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Passive sonar arrays, listening stations
- **Construction**: Anti-submarine detection systems
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High demand for ASW operations

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Rubber ×2 + Copper Wire ×4 + Amplifier Tubes ×2 | Assembly | Hydrophones ×1 | Sonar Works |
| Hydrophones ×4 | Array Configuration | Passive Sonar Array ×1 | Naval Electronics |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~360 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at sonar facilities, +35% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom
- **Major Consumers**: Anti-submarine forces, submarines
- **Bottlenecks**: Specialized manufacturing, sensitive materials

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Critical for ASW
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Hydrophones are essential for anti-submarine warfare. Without passive detection capability, surface ships are vulnerable to submarine ambush. Convoy escorts depend on hydrophones to detect and track U-boats before they can attack.
