## Description

> *Display tubes for radar and fire control systems. The eyes that show operators what electronic sensors detect.*

---

## Lore

Cathode ray tubes transform invisible electronic signals into visible images. An electron beam sweeps across a phosphorescent screen, painting pictures of radar returns, creating displays that operators can interpret. Without CRTs, radar and fire control systems would be useless black boxes - they detect targets but couldn't show them to humans.

Manufacturing CRTs requires precision glass work, careful vacuum creation, and exact phosphor application. The tubes are fragile, sensitive to shock and magnetic fields, and prone to burn-in from static displays. Yet they are irreplaceable - there is simply no other way to display electronic information in this era. Operators learn to interpret the fuzzy glows and blips that represent enemy ships and aircraft.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~360 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at advanced facilities, +40% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom, Germany
- **Major Consumers**: Radar-equipped vessels, fire control systems
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision manufacturing, phosphor compounds

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Critical for radar operation
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

CRTs are essential for modern naval warfare. Without working displays, radar systems cannot be used effectively. A damaged CRT blinds an entire sensor system until replacement.
