## Description

> *Glass electronic valves for amplification and switching. The beating heart of all electronic equipment.*

## Lore

Vacuum tubes are the foundation of all electronics in this era. These glass envelopes contain carefully arranged electrodes in a vacuum, allowing electrons to flow in controlled ways. They amplify weak signals into strong ones, switch circuits on and off, and make radio, radar, and fire control possible.

The tubes are fragile miracles of manufacturing. Each one requires precise assembly, careful evacuation of air, and exact placement of elements. They burn out with use, crack from shock, and fail from vibration. Radio operators keep spares within reach, knowing that a failed tube means a dead radio at the worst possible moment.
