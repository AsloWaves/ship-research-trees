## Description

> *Electromagnetic switching devices for remote circuit control. The building blocks of automated systems.*

## Lore

Relays are switches that don't require human hands. An electrical signal energizes a coil, which pulls a contact closed, completing another circuit. This simple principle enables remote control of powerful systems from safe distances - a low-power signal can switch high-current circuits that would be dangerous to operate manually.

Naval applications for relays are countless. Fire control systems use them to coordinate guns, damage control panels use them to operate pumps and valves, and automated systems use them for everything from engine controls to alarm circuits. A modern warship contains thousands of relays, clicking and clacking as systems operate.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~14 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at production centers, +20% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Industrial nations with electronics capability
- **Major Consumers**: Equipment manufacturers, shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Contact materials, precision assembly

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential for automated systems
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Relays enable the automation that makes modern warships possible. Without them, every system would require direct manual operation. Relay failure can cascade through interconnected systems, causing widespread malfunctions.
