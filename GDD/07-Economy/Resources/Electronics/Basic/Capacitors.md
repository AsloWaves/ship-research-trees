## Description

> *Electronic components for storing electrical charge. Used in filtering, timing, and coupling circuits.*

## Lore

Capacitors store electrical energy like tiny rechargeable batteries, but they charge and discharge in fractions of a second. This property makes them essential for smoothing power supplies, coupling signals between circuit stages, and creating the timing pulses that synchronize electronic systems.

Naval capacitors must withstand heat, vibration, and voltage spikes that would destroy commercial components. Military-grade capacitors use better materials and more robust construction, but they still fail. A shorted capacitor can take out an entire circuit, while an open one causes mysterious malfunctions that frustrate technicians.
