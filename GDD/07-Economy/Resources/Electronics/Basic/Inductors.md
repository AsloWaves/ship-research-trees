## Description

> *Wire coils for storing energy in magnetic fields. Used in filtering, tuning, and power circuits.*

## Lore

Inductors are coils of wire that resist changes in current flow. When current tries to increase, they push back; when it tries to decrease, they try to maintain it. This property makes them essential for filtering power supplies, tuning radio circuits, and protecting equipment from sudden current changes.

The simplest inductor is just wire wound on a core, but designing the right inductor for an application requires careful calculation. Too few turns and it has no effect; too many and it blocks the signals you want to pass. Radio technicians spend considerable time selecting and adjusting inductors to tune their equipment.
