## Description

> *Sacrificial circuit protection devices. They burn out so your equipment doesn't.*

## Lore

Fuses are designed to fail. A thin wire or strip melts when current exceeds safe levels, breaking the circuit before expensive equipment or wiring can be damaged. It's a simple, elegant solution to a dangerous problem - better to replace a cheap fuse than repair a burned-out motor or fire-damaged wiring.

Every electrical circuit aboard ship should have appropriate fuse protection. In the chaos of battle, power surges from near misses, flooding, and damaged equipment can spike through electrical systems. Fuses catch these surges, isolating damaged sections before problems spread. Wise electricians carry pockets full of spare fuses.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal variation |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All industrial nations
- **Major Consumers**: Everyone with electrical systems

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Common safety component
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (1/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Fuses are the cheapest insurance against electrical disaster. Running out during battle damage repair can force dangerous workarounds. Bypassing blown fuses is tempting but risks catastrophic fires.
