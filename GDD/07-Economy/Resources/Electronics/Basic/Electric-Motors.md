## Description

> *Electromagnetic machines converting electrical power to mechanical motion. The muscles of automated systems.*

## Lore

Electric motors turn invisible electrical power into useful mechanical work. They drive pumps, operate winches, train gun mounts, and power countless auxiliary systems. Every automated mechanism aboard a warship likely has an electric motor at its heart, converting electricity into motion.

Motor size varies enormously - from tiny units in fire control equipment to massive propulsion motors in electric-drive battleships and submarines. Each application demands specific characteristics: speed, torque, duty cycle, and operating environment all determine which motor fits the job. Replacing motors often means finding exact matches or improvising adaptations.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Motor Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major industrial ports | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Damaged equipment | Medium | 0-1 units |
| Trade | Industrial suppliers | Hard | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Pumps, winches, servo systems
- **Construction**: Automated ship systems
- **Consumable**: N/A (repairable)
- **Trade**: High demand for repairs and upgrades

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper Wire ×8 + Iron ×4 + Bearing Bronze ×2 | Assembly | Electric Motors ×1 | Motor Works |
| Electric Motors ×1 + Gears ×2 | Assembly | Motor Drive Unit ×1 | Workshop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~450 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at motor works, +40% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Major industrial powers
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper supply, precision manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for automated systems
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Electric motors enable the automation that modern warships depend on. Gun mounts, damage control systems, and countless auxiliary equipment require motors to function. Motor failure can cripple entire systems.
