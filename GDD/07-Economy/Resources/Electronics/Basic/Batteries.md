## Description

> *Lead-acid storage batteries for backup and submarine power. Heavy, corrosive, but essential.*

---

## Lore

Batteries store electrical energy chemically, providing power when generators fail or engines stop. For surface ships, they're backup systems for essential services. For submarines, they're life itself - the only power source when submerged, determining how long a boat can stay down and how fast it can move.

Lead-acid batteries are temperamental beasts. They require careful charging, regular maintenance, and constant monitoring. Overcharging produces explosive hydrogen gas. Undercharging leads to sulfation and reduced capacity. Seawater contamination destroys them instantly. Yet despite these challenges, no better technology exists for storing large amounts of electrical energy.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Battery Works | Medium | 4 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Medium | Standard price |
| Salvage | Submarines, ships | Medium | 0-2 units |
| Trade | Industrial suppliers | Medium | Moderate availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Submarine power systems, emergency backup
- **Construction**: Essential ship systems
- **Consumable**: ✅ Limited cycle life, eventual replacement
- **Trade**: High demand for submarines

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Lead ×4 + Sulfuric Acid ×2 | Assembly | Batteries ×2 | Battery Works |
| Batteries ×10 | Installation | Submarine Battery Bank ×1 | Shipyard |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~70 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at production centers, +30% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Industrial nations with lead supply
- **Major Consumers**: Submarine operations, backup power systems
- **Bottlenecks**: Lead supply, acid supply, specialized manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Critical for submarines
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Batteries are the lifeblood of submarine operations. A submarine's battery capacity determines its tactical options - how long it can remain submerged, how fast it can sprint to escape, how far it can travel silently. Battery supply directly affects submarine effectiveness.
