## Description

> *Manual electrical switches for circuit control. From simple toggles to complex selector switches.*

---

## Lore

Switches are the interface between human operators and electrical systems. Every light, every motor, every piece of equipment requires switches to control it. Naval switches must function reliably under combat conditions - wet hands, vibration, smoke, and darkness cannot prevent an operator from finding and operating critical controls.

The variety of switches aboard a warship is staggering. Toggle switches for simple on-off control, rotary switches for selecting modes, push buttons for momentary activation, and complex watertight switches for damage control. Each type serves a specific purpose, and mixing them up can cause confusion in emergencies.

| Trade | Electrical suppliers | Easy | Abundant |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Control panels, electrical systems
- **Construction**: Ship electrical installation
- **Consumable**: ✅ Replacement for worn switches
- **Trade**: Steady demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Brass Fittings ×1 + Bakelite ×1 | Manufacturing | Switches ×8 | Electronics Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal variation |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All industrial nations
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: None significant

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Common but essential
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Switches are fundamental electrical components. Their low individual value masks their critical importance - without working switches, operators cannot control ship systems. Battle damage often requires extensive switch replacement.
