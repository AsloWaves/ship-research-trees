## Description

> *Bare copper conductor wire in various gauges. The foundation of all electrical systems.*

## Lore

Copper wire is the nervous system of modern warships. Miles of it run through every vessel, carrying power and signals from bow to stern, from keel to masthead. Every circuit, every system, every electrical device depends on copper wire to function. Without it, a ship becomes a lifeless hull.

The quality of copper wire matters enormously. Pure copper conducts electricity best, but impurities are common. Poor quality wire develops resistance, heats up, causes voltage drops, and eventually fails. Naval electricians become connoisseurs of wire, able to tell quality by color, flexibility, and the way it takes solder.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Copper Works | Easy | 20 per batch |
| Purchase | Any port | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Electrical systems | Easy | 5-15 units |
| Trade | Any supplier | Easy | Abundant |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: All electrical components, wiring harnesses
- **Construction**: Ship electrical systems
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Universal demand, low value

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper Ingots ×1 | Wire Drawing | Copper Wire ×10 | Copper Works |
| Copper Wire ×5 + Rubber ×1 | Insulating | Insulated Cable ×4 | Electronics Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~4 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -10% at copper producing areas, +15% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Chile, United States copper belt
- **Major Consumers**: All shipyards and repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper ore supply during wartime

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential but common
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Copper wire is everywhere and needed for everything electrical. Its low value per unit masks its strategic importance - without steady supply, no electrical repairs are possible and new construction halts.
