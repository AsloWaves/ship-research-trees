## Description

> *Rubber-insulated copper cable for protected electrical runs. Essential for wet and hazardous environments.*

---

## Lore

Ships are hostile environments for electricity. Salt water conducts, steel structures create ground faults, and explosive atmospheres fill magazine spaces. Insulated cable keeps electricity contained, preventing shorts, shocks, and explosions that bare wire would cause.

The rubber insulation is as important as the copper inside. It must resist water, oil, heat, and the constant flexing of a working ship. Poor insulation cracks, exposes copper, and creates dangerous conditions. Good insulation lasts for years despite harsh treatment.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -10% at production centers, +15% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Industrial nations with rubber access
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Rubber supply, especially for Axis powers

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential for safe electrical systems
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Insulated cable is the safe alternative to bare wire in naval environments. The rubber shortage affects Axis powers severely, forcing them to use inferior substitutes that create electrical hazards.
