## Description

> *Ship's electrical generators for primary power production. The heart of every vessel's electrical system.*

---

## Lore

Generators convert mechanical power from engines into the electricity that feeds every system aboard ship. Modern warships are insatiable consumers of electrical power - radars, fire control, communications, lighting, ventilation, and countless motors all demand their share. Without functioning generators, a ship becomes a floating hulk.

Redundancy is essential. Combat damage can knock out generators, and a single point of failure would be catastrophic. Ships carry multiple generators, each capable of powering essential systems alone. Damage control teams prioritize restoring generator power above almost everything else - without electricity, the ship cannot fight, cannot navigate, cannot survive.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Heavy Electrical Works | Very Hard | 1 per batch |
| Purchase | Major naval yards | Very Hard | Extreme price |
| Salvage | Destroyed ships | Very Hard | 0-1 units |
| Contract | Naval yard | Hard | Major quest reward |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Ship power systems
- **Construction**: Primary ship installation
- **Consumable**: N/A (repairable)
- **Trade**: Extreme demand, extremely rare

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper Wire ×15 + Iron ×8 + Bearing Bronze ×4 | Heavy Assembly | Generators ×1 | Heavy Electrical Works |
| Generators ×2 + Transformers ×4 | Installation | Ship Power Plant ×1 | Naval Shipyard |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3600 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at heavy industry, +50% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Only major industrial powers
- **Major Consumers**: Naval shipyards, major repairs
- **Bottlenecks**: Heavy manufacturing capacity, copper supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Irreplaceable ship component
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Generators are among the most critical components of any warship. Replacement requires major shipyard facilities and significant resources. A ship that loses all generators loses all fighting capability.
