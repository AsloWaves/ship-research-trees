## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Staple grain of the Pacific theater, essential for feeding Asian populations and Japanese forces. Critical cargo for supply routes from Indochina, Burma, and occupied territories.

## Lore

Rice is the lifeblood of Japan's Pacific empire. Japanese merchant fleets transport rice from occupied Burma, Indochina, and Korea to feed the home islands and forward garrisons. American submarines target these rice convoys as ruthlessly as grain U-boats in the Atlantic - starving Japan's war machine begins with cutting off rice shipments. Control of rice-producing regions drives Japanese expansion into Southeast Asia. For China and other occupied nations, Japanese requisition of rice crops leads to famine and resistance.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Trading | Southeast Asian ports | Easy | 50-100 units |
| Convoy Interception | Pacific supply routes | High | 200-500 units |
| Port Capture | Occupied territories | Medium | 100-300 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be processed into rations at supply facilities
- **Construction**: Required for establishing Pacific forward bases
- **Consumable**: Restores crew morale in Asian theater operations
- **Trade**: High demand in Japan and occupied zones, profitable smuggling

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Very high in Japan (2.5x), Low in Indochina (0.7x) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Indochina, Burma, Korea, occupied China, Java
- **Major Consumers**: Japanese home islands, forward Pacific bases, occupied cities
- **Bottlenecks**: American submarine campaign, Allied air raids, monsoon seasons

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Rice is Japan's strategic vulnerability. The home islands cannot feed themselves - they must import rice or starve. American submarine warfare specifically targets rice convoys to strangle Japan's war economy. By 1945, successful interdiction of rice shipments contributes directly to Japanese collapse. Control rice, control the Pacific war.
