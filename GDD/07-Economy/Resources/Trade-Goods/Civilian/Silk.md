## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Luxury silk fabric from Asia, valuable for trade and surprisingly essential for parachute manufacturing. Japanese silk exports become contraband cargo as war tensions escalate.

---

## Lore

Before Pearl Harbor, Japanese silk is America's primary source for parachutes - both for aviators and airborne troops. This creates a strategic dilemma: boycotting Japan means losing silk supplies critical for military aviation. Blockade runners and neutral merchants make fortunes smuggling silk from Japanese-occupied China. The silk trade becomes espionage territory - is that merchant carrying luxury goods or material for American parachute factories? Japan uses silk exports as economic leverage, while developing synthetic alternatives. Chinese resistance fighters raid silk shipments destined for Japanese coffers.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Smuggling | Neutral Asian ports | High | 20-30 units |
| Black Market | Shanghai, Hong Kong | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Raiding | Japanese merchant ships | Very High | 30-50 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Parachute manufacturing, officer uniforms, luxury trade goods
- **Construction**: Not applicable for base construction
- **Consumable**: Can be sold for premium prices, improves officer morale
- **Trade**: Extremely high value cargo, smuggling profits, diplomatic leverage

### Processing & Refinement

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~7 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | Extreme - 3x in US/Europe, 1.0x in Asia, prohibited in wartime |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Japan, occupied China, French Indochina
- **Major Consumers**: US parachute factories, luxury goods markets, officer corps
- **Bottlenecks**: War embargoes, smuggling networks, synthetic alternatives

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Silk occupies a unique strategic position - it's both luxury good and military necessity. American aviation depends on silk parachutes until synthetics become available. This creates the paradox of buying from potential enemies. Silk smuggling becomes high-profit, high-risk enterprise. Control silk trade, and you control both military supply and diplomatic leverage.
