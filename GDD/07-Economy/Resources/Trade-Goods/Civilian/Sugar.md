## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Refined sugar from Caribbean and Pacific plantations, essential for naval rations and crew morale. Provides quick energy and makes hardtack palatable.

---

## Lore

Sugar is mundane but mission-critical. Naval rations depend on sugar to make preserved food edible - hardtack, coffee, tea, and canned goods all need sweetening. Quick energy from sugar helps exhausted crews maintain alertness during long watches. Caribbean sugar plantations operate at maximum capacity feeding Allied appetites. Japanese control of Pacific sugar sources creates shortages in certain theaters. German U-boats find destroying sugar convoys nearly as effective as targeting fuel - demoralized, energy-depleted crews can't fight effectively. British tea culture multiplies sugar demand astronomically. Sugar rationing at home means naval supplies get priority.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Trading | Caribbean, Hawaii, Philippines | Easy | 40-60 units |
| Convoy Cargo | Sugar trade routes | Medium | 60-90 units |
| Plantation Raids | Occupied island territories | Medium | 50-80 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Naval rations, coffee/tea supplies, preserved foods, morale items
- **Construction**: Required for mess facilities and galley operations
- **Consumable**: Provides quick energy boost and morale increase
- **Trade**: High demand globally, profitable bulk cargo

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 60 Sugar + 50 Flour | Baking | 150 Baked Goods | Galley/Bakery |
| 20 Sugar + 50 Tea | Ration Making | 100 Tea Rations | Supply Depot |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | High in Europe/Asia (1.7x), Low in Caribbean (0.7x) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Caribbean islands, Hawaii, Philippines, Java, Cuba
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces, civilian rationing programs, food processing
- **Bottlenecks**: Harvest seasons, refining capacity, shipping routes, occupation disruptions

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Sugar is operationally significant for naval morale and nutrition. While not immediately war-critical, sugar shortages directly impact crew performance and food quality. Energy-depleted sailors make mistakes. Unpalatable rations hurt morale. Control of sugar-producing regions provides economic and military advantages.
