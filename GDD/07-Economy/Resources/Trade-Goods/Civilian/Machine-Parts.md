## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Industrial machine parts including pumps, valves, bearings, and mechanical components. Critical for maintaining ship systems and repairing damaged machinery at sea or in port.

## Lore

Machine parts keep the naval war machine running. A destroyer's engines contain thousands of precision components - when one fails mid-ocean, you need spares immediately. American industrial capacity churns out generic parts that fit most Allied equipment. Japanese ships often carry unique components, making repairs difficult without proper supply lines. German engineering produces high-quality but specialized parts that can't be easily substituted. Neutral merchants smuggle scarce machine parts to both sides at premium prices. Submarine tenders stock extensive inventories since submarines can't return to port for every mechanical failure. Captured enemy ships become parts sources when official supply runs dry.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Trading | Industrial ports, naval supply depots | Medium | 15-20 units |
| Salvage Operations | Damaged ships, wrecked machinery | High | 10-18 units |
| Black Market | Neutral ports, smugglers | High | 12-20 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Advanced repair kits, machinery upgrades, system maintenance
- **Construction**: Engine rooms, mechanical systems, automated facilities
- **Consumable**: Direct use for emergency repairs (restores system functionality)
- **Trade**: High demand, valuable cargo for blockade runners

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 20 Machine Parts + 10 Steel | Assembly | 15 Engine Components | Machine Shop |
| 15 Machine Parts | Quality Control | 10 Certified Parts | Industrial Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Extreme in isolated theaters (2.5x), Lower in industrial zones (1.0x) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan (industrial centers)
- **Major Consumers**: Naval repair facilities, forward bases, ship maintenance crews
- **Bottlenecks**: Manufacturing capacity, precision machining, quality steel supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Machine parts are operationally critical. A ship with broken machinery is a floating target. Forward bases without spare parts can't maintain their fleet. The Pacific theater particularly suffers from parts shortages due to long supply lines. Submarines prize compact, high-value machine parts for emergency repairs. Control of industrial manufacturing determines who can keep their fleets operational.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | 1.0x | Mass production capacity |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | 1.3x | Industrial base intact but strained |
| Japan | Scarce | 1.8x | Limited industrial capacity |
| Germany | Moderate | 1.4x | Quality production, limited resources |
