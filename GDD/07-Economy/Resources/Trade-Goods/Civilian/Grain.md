## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Bulk wheat and other cereal grains essential for feeding convoy crews and civilian populations. Critical cargo for Atlantic and Pacific convoy routes during wartime rationing.

---

## Lore

The breadbasket of the Allied war effort, American and Canadian grain keeps Britain fed through the darkest days of the U-boat campaign. Liberty ships and convoy escorts risk torpedo attacks to deliver this vital cargo across the Atlantic. In the Pacific, Australian wheat supplies Allied forces island-hopping toward Japan. Control of grain shipments means control of civilian morale - a starving population cannot support a long war. German U-boats specifically target grain convoys to break British resolve through starvation.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Trading | North American ports | Easy | 50-100 units |
| Convoy Escort | Atlantic convoy routes | Medium | 200-400 units |
| Port Contracts | Agricultural regions | Easy | 100-200 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be processed into Flour at port facilities
- **Construction**: Required for establishing forward supply bases
- **Consumable**: Improves crew morale when delivered to besieged ports
- **Trade**: High demand in blockaded regions, moderate profit margins

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 100 Grain | Milling | 50 Flour | Port Mill |

**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Grain is fundamental to sustaining the Allied war effort. Britain imports 70% of its food, making grain convoys a primary U-boat target. Successful grain deliveries maintain civilian morale and keep industrial workers fed. The Battle of the Atlantic is ultimately fought over cargoes like this - lose the grain convoys, lose the war.
