## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Specialized aircraft components including propellers, engine parts, and hydraulic systems. Critical for maintaining carrier air wings and keeping naval aviation operational.

## Lore

Aircraft carriers are the queens of naval warfare, but their power means nothing without operational aircraft. Every carrier sortie depends on specialized parts - propellers, hydraulic systems, engine components, magnetos, and flight control mechanisms. Naval aircraft operate in the harshest conditions: salt spray corrodes metal, carrier landings stress airframes, and long patrols push engines to their limits. Ships at sea cannot manufacture replacement parts - they depend on supply vessels running the blockade with critical components. A carrier without aircraft parts is a floating fortress with no teeth. Submarine blockades specifically target supply convoys carrying aviation equipment. Japanese island bases struggle with parts shortages as American submarines strangle supply lines. Smart captains hoard aircraft parts like gold, knowing that grounded aircraft mean lost battles.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Supply Convoy | Major naval bases | High | 8-12 units |
| Salvage Operations | Downed aircraft, wrecked carriers | Very High | 3-6 units |
| Black Market | Neutral ports, spy contacts | High | 5-10 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Aircraft repair kits, carrier maintenance systems
- **Construction**: Naval air station upgrades, carrier hangar systems
- **Consumable**: Emergency aircraft repairs (restores 1-2 aircraft to operational status)
- **Trade**: High value to carrier-operating factions, critical for island bases

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 10 Aircraft Parts + 5 Machine Parts | Assembly | 3 Aircraft Repair Kits | Carrier Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~210 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | 2-3x higher in isolated island bases, 1.5x in contested zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (dominant), United Kingdom, Japan (limited)
- **Major Consumers**: Carrier task forces, naval air stations, island garrisons
- **Bottlenecks**: Submarine interdiction, manufacturing capacity, specialized tooling

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Aircraft parts determine naval air power effectiveness. Carriers without replacement parts become floating targets within weeks. Japanese forces in the Pacific desperately need parts as American submarines cut supply lines. Island bases with stockpiled parts can maintain air superiority; those without face inevitable defeat. Control of aircraft part supplies directly translates to control of the skies over contested waters.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | 1.0x | Massive industrial production |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | 1.5x | Decent production, convoy dependent |
| Japan | Scarce | 2.5x | Critical shortages in late war |
| Germany | Limited | 2.0x | Focus on land-based aviation |
