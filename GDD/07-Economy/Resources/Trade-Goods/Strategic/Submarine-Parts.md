## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Specialized submarine components including periscope mechanisms, diesel engine parts, battery systems, and pressure hull fittings. Critical for maintaining undersea warfare capability.

---

## Lore

Submarines are the silent killers of naval warfare, but they depend on specialized parts that cannot be improvised. Periscope hydraulics, diesel engine components, battery cells, diving plane actuators, torpedo tube mechanisms - these precision systems operate under crushing pressure and corrosive saltwater. A submarine with damaged diving planes cannot submerge. Failed batteries mean surfacing into enemy air patrols. Broken torpedo tube doors end combat effectiveness. German U-boat bases desperately need parts as Allied bombing disrupts production. Japanese submarines suffer maintenance crises when supply lines are severed. Submarine tenders carrying spare parts are priority targets - one successful raid can cripple an entire submarine flotilla. Smart submarine commanders hoard critical spare parts knowing that mechanical failure thousands of miles from base means death. A submarine force without adequate parts loses boats to mechanical failures as surely as to depth charges.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Supply Convoys | Submarine bases, naval arsenals | High | 8-12 units |
| Salvage Operations | Damaged submarines, enemy wrecks | Very High | 4-8 units |
| Black Market | Neutral ports, desperate dealers | High | 6-10 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Submarine repair kits, torpedo systems, periscope assemblies
- **Construction**: Submarine pens, maintenance facilities, refit stations
- **Consumable**: Emergency submarine repairs (restores diving/combat capability)
- **Trade**: High value to submarine-operating factions, critical for U-boat warfare

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 10 Submarine Parts + 5 Machine Parts | Assembly | 3 Submarine Repair Kits | Submarine Pen |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~225 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | 2-3x higher in isolated submarine bases, 1.5x in contested zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (U-boats), United States, United Kingdom, Japan
- **Major Consumers**: Submarine flotillas, submarine bases, refit facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Specialized manufacturing, bombing of production facilities, tender ship availability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Submarine parts determine undersea warfare capability. German U-boat offensive depends on maintaining submarine fleet - parts shortages cripple wolf pack operations. Allied targeting of submarine construction and supply dramatically reduces Axis effectiveness. Japanese submarine force deteriorates when spare parts become unavailable. A submarine force with adequate parts maintains operational tempo; one without faces declining readiness and eventually mission failure. Submarine warfare decides convoy battles, and submarine parts determine who can sustain undersea operations. Mechanical failures kill submarines as surely as depth charges when critical parts are unavailable.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Moderate | 1.2x | Growing submarine fleet, good production |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | 1.4x | Active submarine operations, adequate supply |
| Japan | Scarce | 2.2x | Submarine force maintenance difficult, supply issues |
| Germany | Moderate | 1.5x | U-boat priority, but factories bombed, parts critical |
