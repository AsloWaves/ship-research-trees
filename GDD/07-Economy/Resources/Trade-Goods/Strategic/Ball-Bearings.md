## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision ball bearings essential for all rotating machinery - from tank turrets to aircraft engines. Swedish ball bearings are war-critical contraband fought over by all sides.

---

## Lore

Ball bearings are the hidden keystone of modern warfare. Every engine, gun turret, and rotating mechanism depends on precision bearings. Swedish company SKF dominates global production, making neutral Sweden strategically vital. Both Germany and the Allies desperately compete for Swedish ball bearing exports. Allied bombers specifically target Schweinfurt ball bearing factories in costly raids. German industry nearly collapses when bearing production is disrupted. Submarine commanders smuggle compact, high-value bearings through blockades. Without adequate bearings, aircraft engines seize, ships can't traverse guns, and tanks can't rotate turrets. A single crate of precision bearings is worth more than its weight in gold.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Smuggling | Neutral Sweden, Switzerland | Very High | 15-25 units |
| Black Market | Spy networks, contacts | Extreme | 10-20 units |
| Factory Raids | Enemy industrial targets | Extreme | 20-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Engine components, weapon systems, turret mechanisms
- **Construction**: All rotating machinery, advanced systems
- **Consumable**: Direct use for emergency repairs (critical systems)
- **Trade**: Extremely high value smuggling cargo

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~45 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | 4x+ in Germany/Japan, 1.5x in neutral zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Sweden (SKF), United States, limited German/Japanese production
- **Major Consumers**: All military forces, aircraft production, tank manufacturing
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision manufacturing, strategic bombing, neutral export controls

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Ball bearings are absolutely war-critical. Without them, military production halts completely. Swedish neutrality creates diplomatic crisis as both sides demand bearing exports. Allied bombing of Schweinfurt reflects bearing importance. Axis powers literally cannot produce weapons without adequate bearing supply. Control of bearing production decides industrial warfare capability.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Moderate | 1.5x | Domestic production developing |
| United Kingdom | Scarce | 2.0x | Dependent on imports |
| Japan | Very Scarce | 3.5x | Critical shortage |
| Germany | Scarce | 2.5x | Bombed factories, Swedish imports |
