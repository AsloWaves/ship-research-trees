## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Top-secret technical blueprints for advanced weapons systems, ship designs, and military technology. Stolen, smuggled, or captured intelligence that could turn the tide of war.

---

## Lore

In naval warfare, blueprints are intelligence gold. A single set of German acoustic torpedo blueprints allows the Allies to develop countermeasures. Japanese carrier designs captured at Midway reveal critical vulnerabilities. Soviet agents smuggle radar blueprints from Allied research facilities. Every navy desperately seeks enemy technical documents while protecting their own secrets. Captured blueprints for fire control computers, torpedo guidance systems, or advanced armor schemes save years of research. Espionage networks risk everything to photograph secret designs. Submarine commanders carry sealed cases of blueprints - orders to destroy them before capture. A blockade runner with rare blueprints is worth more than a convoy of supplies. In the technology race, blueprints determine who innovates first and who catches up too late.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Espionage Operations | Enemy research facilities | Extreme | 1-2 units |
| Captured Intelligence | Seized ships, defeated bases | Very High | 1-3 units |
| Black Market | Spy networks, double agents | Extreme | 1-2 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Unlocks advanced ship modules, weapon systems, technology upgrades
- **Construction**: Enables construction of advanced ships/facilities
- **Consumable**: Research acceleration (reduces research time for specific technologies)
- **Trade**: Extremely valuable to technologically inferior factions

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 3 Blueprints + 5 Research Data | Analysis | 1 Technology Unlock | Research Laboratory |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1019 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | 5-10x depending on technology type and faction needs |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Espionage agencies, captured intelligence, defectors
- **Major Consumers**: All naval powers desperately seeking technological advantage
- **Bottlenecks**: Security measures, counter-intelligence, extreme rarity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Blueprints represent the ultimate strategic intelligence. Captured German Type XXI submarine blueprints change Allied anti-submarine tactics. Stolen radar designs eliminate years of research. Japanese yamato-class battleship plans reveal armor vulnerabilities. A single blueprint can invalidate enemy advantages or unlock game-changing technologies. Nations execute entire covert operations to steal or protect critical blueprints. The technology race is won by those who steal effectively and defend secrets ruthlessly.
