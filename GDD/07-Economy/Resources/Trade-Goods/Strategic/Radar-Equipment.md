## Lore

Radar is the secret weapon that changes naval warfare forever. British cavity magnetron technology enables compact, powerful radars that detect surface ships and aircraft at unprecedented ranges. American destroyers with radar dominate night engagements against Japanese forces lacking equivalent systems. German U-boats suffer catastrophic losses when Allied aircraft use radar to hunt submarines on the surface. Radar-equipped cruisers ambush enemy task forces in darkness. The technology is so secret that damaged radar sets must be destroyed before capture - recovered Allied magnetrons would give Axis powers years of research advantage. British fear of radar compromise leads to extraordinary security measures. Ships with radar see enemies that cannot see them, track aircraft beyond visual range, and engage accurately in total darkness. The radar war determines who controls the night and the storm.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Allied Supply | Major naval bases (Allied only) | Very High | 3-5 units |
| Salvage Operations | Damaged Allied ships | Extreme | 1-2 units |
| Intelligence Capture | Extremely rare enemy raids | Extreme | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Radar systems, fire control radars, search radars
- **Construction**: Radar installations, coastal warning networks, ship upgrades
- **Consumable**: Emergency radar repairs (restores detection capability)
- **Trade**: Priceless - Allied powers strictly control distribution

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 5 Radar Equipment + 10 Electrical Parts | Installation | 2 Complete Radar Systems | Electronics Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1350 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | Not openly tradeable - Allied military distribution only |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom (cavity magnetron), limited Axis development
- **Major Consumers**: Allied naval forces, coastal defenses, aircraft
- **Bottlenecks**: Advanced technology, strict security, limited production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Radar is arguably the most decisive technological advantage of WW2. Allied ships with radar dominate night actions. Radar-equipped aircraft hunt submarines that would otherwise escape. Fire control radar enables accurate gunnery in darkness and bad weather. The Battle of the Atlantic turns when aircraft radar makes surface-running U-boats vulnerable. Japanese forces without equivalent radar technology suffer devastating night defeats. The cavity magnetron is so critical that British risk everything to protect it - damaged radar sets have scuttling charges to prevent capture. Ships with radar see; ships without are blind. The difference often determines who lives and who dies.
