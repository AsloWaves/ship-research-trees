## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

High-grade precision machining tools including micrometers, calipers, threading dies, and specialized cutting equipment. Swiss-made tools are the gold standard for military manufacturing.

## Lore

Precision tools are the foundation of quality weapons production. Swiss precision tools - micrometers accurate to thousandths of an inch, hardened cutting dies, specialized gauges - enable manufacture of interchangeable parts and tight-tolerance mechanisms. Without precision tools, gunsmiths cannot bore accurate barrels, machinists cannot cut proper threads, and factories cannot maintain quality standards. Neutral Switzerland profits enormously from selling precision tools to all combatants. German industry depends on Swiss tool imports until Allied pressure restricts exports. Japanese factories struggle with inferior domestic tools - leading to quality control problems. A ship's machine shop with quality precision tools can manufacture replacement parts; one with poor tools can barely make field repairs. Smart engineering officers hoard precision tools knowing they're worth their weight in gold when critical repairs are needed thousands of miles from home port.

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~43 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | 1.5-2x higher in Pacific theater, 1.3x in remote bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Switzerland (premium), United States, Germany, United Kingdom
- **Major Consumers**: All military manufacturing, ship repair facilities, field armories
- **Bottlenecks**: Swiss neutrality restrictions, precision steel availability, skilled toolmakers

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Precision tools enable quality manufacturing and field repairs. Swiss tools are universally recognized as superior - neutral Switzerland profits from all sides. Without adequate precision tools, manufacturing quality degrades severely. Ships with good machine shop tools can fabricate replacement parts; those without must limp to port. Japanese quality control suffers from inferior domestic tools compared to Swiss imports. Allied pressure on Switzerland to restrict Axis tool exports creates German shortages. A well-equipped machine shop with quality precision tools is worth more than tons of raw materials when repairs are needed at sea.
