## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Twisted steel plates and warped metal fragments recovered from sunken vessels. Can be smelted down for raw materials or sold for scrap value.

---

## Lore

After every naval engagement, the sea floor becomes littered with twisted metal, shattered bulkheads, and torn hull plating. Salvage crews trawl battle zones to recover these remnants, which represent vital raw materials in a war economy where every ton of steel counts. While low-quality compared to fresh ingots, scrap metal remains valuable for secondary applications, ammunition casings, and emergency repairs. Shipyards pay modest prices, but the real value lies in volume—a successful salvage operation can recover tons of material from a single wreck site.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Wreck Salvage | Battle zones, wreck sites | Easy | 10-30 units |
| Debris Field Collection | Post-combat areas | Very Easy | 5-15 units |
| Harbor Cleanup | Damaged ports | Easy | 8-20 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be smelted into low-grade steel or iron at foundries
- **Construction**: Used for non-critical ship repairs and base fortifications
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Always in demand at ports with foundries; steady baseline value

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Scrap Metal x10 | Smelting | Steel x3 | Foundry |
| Scrap Metal x15 | Sorting/Processing | Iron Ore x8 | Salvage Yard |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher prices in resource-starved regions (Japan +15%, Germany +10%) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage operations in active combat zones
- **Major Consumers**: All shipyards and foundries; desperate nations with material shortages
- **Bottlenecks**: Transportation capacity from remote salvage sites

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (Low-quality but useful for repairs)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Reliable profit from volume)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (Abundant in combat zones)

Scrap metal is the bread-and-butter resource of salvage operations. While individually low-value, it's found in massive quantities and provides steady income. Nations with limited access to iron ore mines rely heavily on recovered scrap to supplement their industrial output. Smart traders stockpile scrap metal during peacetime and sell when blockades or supply disruptions drive prices upward.
