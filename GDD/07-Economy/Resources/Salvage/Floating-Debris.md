## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Mixed wreckage and debris floating on the surface after naval engagements. Contains scrap metal, wood, and occasionally useful salvageable components.

---

## Lore

After every naval battle, the sea churns with debris - shattered lifeboats, torn plating, smashed equipment, and personal effects. Salvage crews work these debris fields methodically, scooping up anything that floats. Most is worthless scrap, but experienced salvagers know that debris fields hide treasures: intact ammunition, tools, even small arms and medical supplies in waterproof containers. Floating debris also serves as processing fodder - smelted down for raw materials or sorted for specific components. Some superstitious sailors avoid debris fields where many died, but professional salvagers see only profit margins in the floating wreckage.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Battle sites (surface) | Very Easy | 10-30 units |
| Looting | Recent wreck locations | Easy | 5-15 units |
| Scavenging | Coastal drift zones | Easy | 3-10 units |
| Random Encounter | Open ocean | Very Easy | 1-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be processed into scrap metal, salvaged wood, occasional random components
- **Construction**: Low-quality bulk material for makeshift repairs, base fortifications
- **Consumable**: Can be "opened" like loot boxes for random salvage yields (mostly scrap, rarely valuables)
- **Trade**: Minimal value, but bulk quantities worthwhile, accepted by most scrap dealers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Floating Debris x10 | Sorting | Scrap Metal x5, Wood x3, Random Component | Salvage Yard |
| Floating Debris x20 | Bulk Processing | Steel Ingots x2, Mixed Materials x5 | Smelter |
| Floating Debris x1 | Investigation | Random salvage (5% rare item chance) | None (manual) |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~10 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Essentially none - universally cheap salvage material |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Every naval battle, shipwrecks, coastal storm damage
- **Major Consumers**: Scrap processors, budget repair yards, makeshift construction operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Storage space (bulky), transportation costs often exceed value

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐

Floating debris has virtually no strategic importance but represents the most abundant salvage resource. For new players and budget operations, debris fields offer zero-risk income and crafting materials. The gambling aspect - occasional valuable finds among worthless scrap - keeps salvagers checking debris. In desperate situations, debris can be processed for emergency repairs. Its true value lies in quantity and availability rather than individual quality.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | 100% | Post-battle cleanup operations generate surplus |
| United Kingdom | Abundant | 100% | Active battle zones create constant supply |
| Japan | Abundant | 100% | Pacific theater debris fields extensive |
| Germany | Abundant | 100% | Atlantic wreckage zones well-picked but replenishing |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - appropriate entry-level salvage resource with volume-based economics
- **Adjustment History**: Increased stack size from 20 to 30 to reflect bulk nature; reduced rarity to Common
- **Known Issues**: Monitor processing yields to prevent debris farming from being more profitable than intended
