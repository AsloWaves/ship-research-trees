## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Bunker oil and diesel fuel pumped from sunken tankers and warship fuel tanks. Contaminated with seawater but refinable.

---

## Lore

Fuel is the lifeblood of naval warfare. A sunken tanker may carry thousands of tons of oil slowly leaking into the ocean—or contained in intact cargo tanks awaiting recovery. Salvage operations pump fuel directly from wrecks using specialized equipment, extracting every usable gallon before environmental concerns or enemy action intervene. The fuel requires processing to remove seawater contamination and debris, but even contaminated bunker oil has value. During fuel crises, nations mounted emergency salvage operations to recover fuel from recently sunk tankers, sometimes working mere miles from enemy coastlines. The Pacific theater saw particularly desperate fuel recovery missions as Japanese oil supplies dwindled.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Tanker Salvage | Sunken oil tanker wrecks | Very Hard | 5-12 units |
| Fuel Tank Pumping | Warship fuel bunkers | Hard | 8-15 units |
| Surface Skimming | Recent spills and leaks | Medium | 3-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Refined into clean bunker fuel or diesel
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: Can be used directly in emergency (reduced efficiency)
- **Trade**: Critical commodity; always in demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Recovered Fuel x10 | Refining | Bunker Fuel x7 | Refinery |
| Recovered Fuel x10 | Filtration | Diesel x6 | Fuel Processing Plant |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~60 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | Fuel-starved regions +60%; oil-rich regions -20% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage operations on tanker wrecks; fuel recovery teams
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces; merchant fleets; island bases
- **Bottlenecks**: Pumping equipment; storage capacity; refining facilities

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

No fuel means no operations. Recovered fuel, even contaminated, can be refined and used. The 30% processing loss is acceptable when fuel convoys face submarine attack. Japan's late-war fuel crisis made every salvaged drop precious—destroyer operations were cancelled to conserve fuel, making recovery operations critical. Oil-poor nations will pay extreme premiums for any fuel source.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | -10% | Abundant domestic oil production |
| United Kingdom | Uncommon | +20% | Dependent on imports; active salvage |
| Japan | Rare | +60% | Desperate fuel crisis; every drop matters |
| Germany | Uncommon | +30% | Synthetic fuel helps but salvage still valuable |
