## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

National ensign or battle flag recovered from a sunken warship. Symbol of naval pride and victory trophy.

---

## Lore

Naval ensigns represent national honor and ship identity. Capturing an enemy flag symbolized victory in the age of sail—a tradition that continues. Recovered flags serve multiple purposes: own-nation flags return home for memorial services, honoring lost crews; enemy flags become war trophies displayed in naval museums and victory monuments. Famous ship flags command tremendous value—the ensign from a legendary carrier or the Rising Sun flag from a renowned Japanese cruiser. Some flags carry battle honors sewn into fabric, documenting every engagement. Collectors and museums compete intensely for flags from historically significant vessels, particularly those involved in decisive battles.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1019 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Famous ships +150%; own-nation flags (repatriation) +80% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage divers; wreck recovery specialists
- **Major Consumers**: Naval museums, private collectors, memorial organizations
- **Bottlenecks**: Fabric degrades underwater; multiple flags per ship (battle ensign, jack, etc.)

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Flags carry enormous symbolic value but minimal military utility. Own-nation flags honor lost crews and return home for memorial services. Enemy flags serve as tangible victory symbols and morale boosters. Historical value varies dramatically: a flag from an obscure merchant vessel has modest worth, while the ensign from a legendary battleship commands collector premiums. Intelligence value is minimal beyond ship identification.

| Japan | Uncommon | +100% own flags | Cultural reverence; extremely high emotional value |
| Germany | Uncommon | +40% own flags | Historical interest; Kriegsmarine flags sought |
