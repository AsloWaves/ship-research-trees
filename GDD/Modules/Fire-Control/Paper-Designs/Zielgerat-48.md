**What Might Have Been** - Advanced FC computer designed February 1945, never built. Would have closed the gap with Allied systems: full radar integration, automatic rate finding, dual-purpose capability. Represented Germany's attempt to leap ahead in one design - arrived far too late.

**Key Specs (Projected):** 2,800 kg | 45km range | Full radar | Auto-tracking | 4 crew | Dual-purpose

**Innovations:**
- Full radar integration: Designed FROM START for FuMO 213 input (unlike retrofit attempts)
- Automatic rate finding: No operator estimation - radar tracks, computer calculates
- Dual-purpose: Surface AND aircraft (no German operational system had this)
- 0.5 sec updates: vs 10 sec for Basisgerät C/38K

**Why Never Built:** Design finalized Feb 1945. German industry collapsing. Capital ships sunk/inactive. Production facilities destroyed by Allied bombing.

**Comparison to Operational Basisgerät:**
| Feature | Basisgerät | Zielgerät 48 |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Radar | None | Full |
| Rate Finding | Manual | Automatic |
| Targets | Surface only | Dual-purpose |
| Night Capability | None | Full |

**Game Options:** What-if premium module for late-war German ships. Historical note: never actually existed.
