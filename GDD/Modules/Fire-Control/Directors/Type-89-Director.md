**IJN AA Standard** - The Type 89 was Japan's primary high-angle AA director, paired with the ubiquitous Type 89 127mm AA gun. Optical-only design with limited radar integration late-war. Outclassed by American systems but widely deployed on all major warships.

**Key Specs:** 4,500 kg | 4.5m rangefinder | 0° to +85° | 16°/sec train | 2-axis gyro | 6 crew

**Features:**
- Dedicated AA: High-angle only (0° to +85°)
- Tachymetric tracking: Rate-based aircraft lead calculation
- Wide deployment: Standard on cruisers, battleships, carriers
- Nippon Kogaku optics: Quality optical systems

**Limitations:** No effective radar integration. Optical-only vulnerable to night attacks. Slower than Mk 37. 2-axis only.

**Combat Record:** Philippine Sea (1944) - overwhelmed by US air attacks. Leyte Gulf (1944) - insufficient against massed aircraft. Demonstrated Japanese AA doctrine failure.

**Ships:** All IJN heavy cruisers (2-4), battleships (4-6), carriers (2-4). Thousands produced.
