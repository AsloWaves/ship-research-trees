**Royal Navy AA Standard** - The High Angle Control System Mk IV was the RN's dedicated anti-aircraft director. Unlike American dual-purpose approach, British separated surface/AA fire control. HACS handled high-angle only, with tachymetric (rate-aided) tracking.

**Key Specs:** 5,200 kg | 4.57m rangefinder | 0° to +80° | 20°/sec train | 2-axis gyro | 5 crew

**Features:**
- Dedicated AA: Optimized for aircraft engagement only
- Tachymetric tracking: Measures rate of change for lead prediction
- Type 285 radar: Integrated from 1941 for bad weather
- Lighter than Mk 37: 5.2 tons vs 8.2 tons

**Limitations:** No surface capability (need separate DCT). 2-axis only (vs Mk 37's 3-axis). Tachymetric struggles with diving aircraft. Slower tracking than Mk 37.

**Combat Record:** Crete (1941) - heavy AA action against Luftwaffe. Arctic convoys - Type 285 radar critical in poor visibility. Mediterranean - reliable in hot/dusty conditions.

**Ships:** All RN cruisers (1-2), battleships (2-4), carriers (2-4), large destroyers (1).
