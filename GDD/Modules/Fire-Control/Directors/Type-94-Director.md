**Largest Rangefinder Ever** - The Type 94 featured the largest optical rangefinder ever mounted on a warship: 15 meters base length. Could range battleships at 45km - farther than most WWII radar. Peak of Japanese optical fire control philosophy. Yamato-class only.

**Key Specs:** 15,000 kg | 15m rangefinder (LARGEST EVER) | -5° to +45° | 4°/sec train | 2-axis gyro | 10 crew

**Features:**
- 15m rangefinder: Theoretical ranging at 45,000m+ on battleships
- Optical excellence: Nippon Kogaku (Nikon) precision optics
- Heavy armor: 50mm protection for vital system
- Surface only: No AA capability (too slow)

**Limitations:** No radar integration (fatal flaw). Useless at night/bad weather. 4°/sec too slow for aircraft. Japanese optical doctrine obsolete by 1944.

**Combat Record:** Savo Island (1942) - optical night fighting success. Leyte Gulf (1944) - smoke/air attacks negated optical advantage. North Cape lesson: optical systems fail at night.

**Ships:** Yamato (2), Musashi (2). Only 4 ever built.
