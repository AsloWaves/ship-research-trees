**Royal Navy Surface Standard** - The Director Control Tower Mk II was the RN's primary surface fire control director. Featured 30-foot (9.14m) coincidence rangefinder in armored housing. Paired with Admiralty FCT for battleships/cruisers. Separate from AA directors (British doctrine split surface/AA).

**Key Specs:** 12,000 kg | 9.14m rangefinder | -5° to +40° | 5°/sec train | 2-axis gyro | 8 crew

**Features:**
- Long-base rangefinder: 30ft for maximum ranging accuracy
- Type 284 radar: Added 1941+ for bad weather fire control
- Heavy armor: 25mm protects optical equipment
- Coincidence ranging: Reliable, well-understood technology

**Limitations:** Surface only (separate HACS for AA). 2-axis stabilization. Slower than American systems.

**Combat Record:** River Plate (1939) - accurate ranging on Graf Spee. Bismarck chase (1941) - Type 284 radar critical. Mediterranean convoys - reliable performance.

**Ships:** All RN battleships (2-3), cruisers (1-2), County-class (1). Standard interwar/WWII equipment.
