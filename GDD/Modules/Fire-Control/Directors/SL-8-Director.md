**Kriegsmarine AA Eyes** - The SL-8 (Schwere Leitstand, "heavy director") was Germany's standard heavy AA director. Controlled 10.5cm and 12.8cm Flak batteries. Zeiss stereoscopic optics. Late-war FuMO 213 radar integration attempted but never fully successful.

**Key Specs:** 3,200 kg | 4m stereoscopic | -10° to +85° | 18°/sec train | 2-axis gyro | 5 crew

**Features:**
- Stereoscopic tracking: Fast ranging using binocular depth perception
- Zeiss quality: Exceptional German optical precision
- Heavy AA control: Designed for 10.5cm/12.8cm batteries
- Column mount: Compact installation on deck

**Limitations:** Poor radar integration (German weakness). Optical-only until late war. 2-axis stabilization insufficient in heavy seas.

**Combat Record:** Tirpitz defense (1942-44) - extensive smoke screen reliance revealed AA FC weakness. Norway operations - daylight defense adequate. Night attacks exposed system limitations.

**Ships:** Bismarck (2), Tirpitz (2), Scharnhorst (2), Hipper-class (2). All major Kriegsmarine units.
