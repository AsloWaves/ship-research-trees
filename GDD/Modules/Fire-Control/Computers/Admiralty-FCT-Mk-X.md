**Dreyer's Successor** - The Admiralty Fire Control Table replaced the aging Dreyer Table in RN capital ships. Pure mechanical analog computer (no plotting paper). Faster solutions, smaller crew. Designed for treaty battleships (KGV, Nelson classes). Could accept radar range input from 1941.

**Key Specs:** 3,600 kg | 35km range | 35kn target | 5 crew | Radar compatible | Auto wind correction

**Features:**
- Pure mechanical: No paper plotting - faster continuous solutions
- Radar integration: Type 284 input for blind fire (1941+)
- Automatic wind: Wind compensation built into mechanism
- Interchangeable cams: Ballistic profiles for 14", 15", 16" guns

**Limitations:** Still 2-axis (less stable than US 3-axis). Complex maintenance. Heavy.

**Combat Record:** Denmark Strait (1941) - KGV and PoW engaged Bismarck. North Cape (1943) - Duke of York's AFCT achieved hits on Scharnhorst. Mediterranean - reliable treaty battleship service.

**Ships:** King George V-class (1), Nelson-class (1 retrofit), Vanguard (1). All treaty battleships.
