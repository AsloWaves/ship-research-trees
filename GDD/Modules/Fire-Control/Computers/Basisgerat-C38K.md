**German Precision Engineering** - The Basisgerät ("base device") C/38K was the Kriegsmarine's main battery fire control computer. Exceptional mechanical precision but fatally flawed by lack of radar integration. Paired with Kommandogerät director. Bismarck, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst main armament.

**Key Specs:** 2,400 kg | 40km range | 35kn target | 6 crew | No radar | Manual wind

**Features:**
- German precision: Rheinmetall engineering excellence
- Long-range optics: Optimized for 30,000m+ engagement
- Stereoscopic input: Designed for stereoscopic rangefinder data
- Proven mechanics: Reliable gear-train computation

**Fatal Flaw:** No radar integration. FuMO search radars never properly coupled to FC system. Optical systems useless at night/bad weather - proved fatal at North Cape.

**Combat Record:** Denmark Strait (1941) - ranged Hood at 26km optically. Channel Dash (1942) - poor visibility degraded performance. North Cape (1943) - Scharnhorst blinded by darkness, sunk by radar-directed Duke of York.

**Ships:** Bismarck (1), Tirpitz (1), Scharnhorst (1), Gneisenau (1), Hipper-class (1).
