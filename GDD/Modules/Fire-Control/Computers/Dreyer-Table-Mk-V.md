**First True FC Computer** - The Dreyer Table pioneered mechanical fire control, born from Jutland's lessons. Combined graphical plotting (visible paper track) with mechanical computation. Operators could SEE the solution developing while the machine calculated. Foundation of all subsequent FC systems.

**Key Specs:** 2,200 kg | 30km range | 30kn target | 6 crew | Paper plot 200ft | Dumaresq vector solver

**Features:**
- Visual plotting: Paper track shows target motion, crew detects errors visually
- Dumaresq integration: Mechanical vector solver for course/speed
- Continuous tracking: Rate-based prediction between rangefinder readings
- Proven combat: WWI through WWII service record

**Limitations:** Large crew (6). Slower than pure mechanical. Manual rate finding. Superseded by AFCT.

**Combat Record:** Calabria (1940) - HMS Warspite achieved hits at 26,000 yards on Giulio Cesare using Dreyer Table. Interwar exercises proved 20,000+ yard capability.

**Ships:** All RN Queen Elizabeth, Revenge, Nelson-class battleships (until AFCT retrofit).
