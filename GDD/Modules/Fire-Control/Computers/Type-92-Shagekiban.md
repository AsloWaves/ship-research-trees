**Night Battle Calculator** - The Type 92 Shagekiban ("firing calculator") was Japan's standard surface fire control computer for cruisers and older battleships. Designed for Japan's night battle doctrine - optimized for rapid solutions in close-range engagements where optical superiority mattered.

**Key Specs:** 1,800 kg | 35km range | 35kn target | 4 crew | Night optics | Manual wind

**Features:**
- Night battle focus: Optimized for rapid close-range solutions (10-15km)
- Optical integration: Direct coupling to rangefinder data
- Rate solver: Mechanical computation of target motion
- Proven design: Reliable mechanical construction

**Limitations:** No radar input capability. Manual wind correction. Optimized for short-range night actions, less accurate at extreme range.

**Combat Record:** Savo Island (1942) - devastating night victory. Tassafaronga (1942) - rapid torpedo solutions. Guadalcanal naval battles - night fighting success.

**Ships:** All IJN heavy cruisers (Takao, Myoko, Mogami classes), Kongo-class battleships. Standard 1930s equipment.
