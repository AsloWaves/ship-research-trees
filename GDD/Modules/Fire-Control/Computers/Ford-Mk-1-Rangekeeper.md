**Battleship Brain** - The Ford Mk 1 Range Keeper was the mechanical heart of US Navy battleship fire control. 2,000+ precision gears continuously calculated firing solutions, tracking targets and compensating for ballistics to hit at 30km+. Interchangeable cam drums for different gun types.

**Key Specs:** 1,360 kg | 40km range | 35kn target speed | 3 crew | 2,000+ gears | 115V AC

**Features:**
- Continuous tracking: Mechanical integration keeps solution updated between ranges
- Interchangeable cams: Ballistic profiles for 14"/45, 14"/50, 16"/45, 16"/50
- Radar compatible: Mk 1 Mod 1+ accepts radar range input
- Rate solving: Automatically tracks closing/opening speeds

**Limitations:** Large and heavy. No AA capability. Requires trained crew. Mechanical wear over time.

**Combat Record:** Surigao Strait (1944) - USS West Virginia achieved hits at 22,000+ yards in darkness using radar input. Shore bombardment (1944-45) - precision fire on fixed targets.

**Ships:** All USN standard/fast battleships (Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa classes).
