# Compound Steam Engine

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-004 |
| **Type** | Reciprocating Steam (Compound) |
| **Era** | 1870-1895 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 3,000 SHP |

## Description

Early two-stage expansion engine using high and low pressure cylinders. Represents the first attempt to extract more energy from steam through expansion, but less efficient than later triple expansion designs. Common in the transition from simple expansion engines to modern powerplants during the ironclad era.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 3,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Very Slow |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Poor |
| **Reliability** | 75% |
| **Noise Level** | Loud |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (8kt) | 2.5 tons/day | 2,000 nm |
| Flank (12kt) | 8.0 tons/day | 500 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     3,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~12 knots (depends on hull)
Acceleration:     Very Slow (8 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 1.2 kg coal per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     0.7x (inefficient)
Vibration:        Heavy, unbalanced
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Ironclad battleships
- Early protected cruisers
- Armored cruisers (very early)
- Monitors
- Torpedo rams
- Dispatch vessels (1870s-1880s)

## Advantages

- More efficient than simple expansion
- Proven basic technology
- Fully reversible
- Simple two-cylinder design easier than triple
- Parts availability during era
- Better than sail power

## Disadvantages

- Poor thermal efficiency wastes coal
- Heavy and bulky for power output
- Unreliable by later standards
- Severe vibration from unbalanced design
- Very slow acceleration
- Limited top speed capability
- High maintenance requirements
- Noisy operation disturbs crew

## Historical Notes

Compound engines represented a transitional technology between simple expansion engines of the 1860s and the triple expansion engines that would dominate by 1890. The two-stage expansion process recovered some waste heat but fell short of triple expansion's efficiency.

British ironclads like HMS Inflexible (1881) used compound engines producing 8,000 SHP from paired units, achieving 14 knots despite 11,880-ton displacement. The USS Texas (1895), one of America's first modern battleships, was initially designed with compound engines but switched to triple expansion before completion, demonstrating the rapid technological progress of the era.

French ironclads extensively used compound engines through the 1880s, accepting their limitations while waiting for triple expansion technology to mature. The Amiral Baudin class (1883) exemplified this approach with 6,500 SHP compound machinery. By 1895, compound engines were obsolete for new construction, though some remained in service with second-line units through the turn of the century.

The compound engine's main legacy was proving that expansion technology worked, paving the way for triple and even quadruple expansion designs. Their inefficiency made long-range operations difficult and required massive coal bunkers relative to performance.

## Compatible Ships

- Ironclad battleships (1870-1890)
- Early protected cruisers (1880-1885)
- Monitors and coast defense ships
- Harbor defense vessels
- Colonial gunboats (older units)

→ [[Triple-Expansion-Small]] (for small vessels)
