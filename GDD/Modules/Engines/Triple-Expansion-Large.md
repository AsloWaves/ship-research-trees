# Triple Expansion Engine (Large)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-003 |
| **Type** | Reciprocating Steam |
| **Era** | 1880-1915 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 25,000 SHP |

## Description

Heavy-duty triple expansion engine for battleships and large armored cruisers. Represents the absolute limit of reciprocating steam technology with massive cylinders and reinforced crankshafts. While powerful, the vibration and weight of these giants ultimately led to their replacement by turbines in capital ship applications.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 25,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Very Slow |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Average |
| **Reliability** | 88% |
| **Noise Level** | Loud |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (10kt) | 7.5 tons/day | 5,000 nm |
| Flank (18kt) | 32.0 tons/day | 900 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     25,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~18 knots (on battleship hulls)
Acceleration:     Very Slow (7 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.80 kg coal per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.0x (baseline heavy unit)
Vibration:        Severe at high power
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Pre-dreadnought battleships
- Large armored cruisers
- Battle cruisers (very early)
- Coast defense battleships
- Ironclads (later models)

## Advantages

- Massive power output for the era
- Proven technology with worldwide support
- Fully reversible for close-quarters maneuvering
- No reduction gearing required
- Can operate on damaged boilers
- Simple mechanical principles

## Disadvantages

- Enormous weight and volume requirements
- Severe vibration affects gunnery accuracy
- Very slow acceleration hampers tactical response
- Huge coal consumption requires large bunkers
- Requires 40+ stokers per engine at full power
- Mechanical complexity at this scale reduces reliability
- Limited top speed compared to later turbines

## Historical Notes

Large triple expansion engines powered the pre-dreadnought battleship era's giants. HMS Majestic class battleships used paired 12,500 SHP engines for 25,000 SHP total, achieving 17 knots. The USS Maine (1895) and subsequent US pre-dreadnoughts used similar configurations. German battleships like SMS Kaiser class employed refined versions achieving slightly better efficiency.

These engines' greatest weakness became apparent during gunnery trials: the reciprocating motion created substantial vibration that made accurate fire control difficult above 15 knots. This limitation, combined with the weight penalty, made battleships using them vulnerable to the turbine-powered HMS Dreadnought (1906), which could maintain accurate fire at 21 knots.

The Battle of Tsushima (1905) demonstrated both strengths and weaknesses. Russian pre-dreadnoughts with triple expansion engines proved reliable despite poor maintenance, but their vibration and slow speed allowed Japanese ships to dictate engagement terms. After Dreadnought's appearance, no new battleships were built with reciprocating engines, though existing units served through WWI.

## Compatible Ships

- Pre-dreadnought battleships (1890-1905)
- Armored cruisers (large, 1895-1908)
- Training battleships
- Coast defense ships (monitor-type)

## Upgrade Path

→ [[Parsons-Turbine]] (revolutionary upgrade, Dreadnought standard)
→ [[Geared-Turbine-Heavy]] (WWII battleship power)
