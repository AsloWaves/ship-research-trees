# Parsons Direct-Drive Turbine

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-011 |
| **Era** | 1905-1920 |
| **Power Output** | 18,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 55% |

## Description

The Parsons direct-drive turbine revolutionized naval propulsion when first installed in HMS Dreadnought (1906). Unlike reciprocating engines with their hammering pistons, turbines spin continuously at high RPM, producing smooth, vibration-free power. The turbine blades extract energy from high-pressure steam as it expands through multiple stages, similar to a waterwheel but with steam.

However, direct-drive turbines have a fundamental limitation: they operate most efficiently at 1,500-3,000 RPM, while ship propellers work best at 100-200 RPM. Without reduction gearing, the turbine must directly drive the propeller at a compromise speed, sacrificing efficiency. Despite this limitation, the power-to-weight advantage was so dramatic that direct-drive turbines quickly replaced reciprocating engines in capital ships.

## Performance Stats

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | High | Revolutionary for 1906 |
| Efficiency | Moderate | Only at design speed |
| Weight | Medium-Heavy | Better than reciprocating |
| Reliability | Moderate | New technology, teething issues |
| Noise | Low | Smooth, no reciprocating parts |
| Maintenance | Moderate | Blade erosion issues |

## Advantages
- Dramatically higher power than reciprocating engines
- Smooth, vibration-free operation (better gunnery)
- More compact than reciprocating machinery
- Runs on oil fuel (cleaner, faster refueling)
- No reciprocating masses to break down

## Disadvantages
- Very inefficient at low speeds (cruise/patrol)
- Not reversible (requires separate astern turbine)
- Poor fuel economy compared to later turbines
- Compromised propeller speed
- Steam erosion of turbine blades
- New technology - reliability concerns initially

## Historical Notes

HMS Dreadnought proved the concept in 1906, achieving 21 knots with unprecedented smoothness. The lack of vibration dramatically improved long-range gunnery accuracy - a key tactical advantage. Within five years, every major navy had abandoned reciprocating engines for capital ships.

However, the inefficiency at cruising speed was a serious operational problem. Ships burned excessive fuel during long patrols, limiting range. The Royal Navy's HMS Invincible class had to slow to 16 knots for efficient cruising when designed for 25-knot operations. This drove development of reduction gearing, which solved the efficiency problem by 1915.

## Famous Examples
- HMS Dreadnought (1906): 23,000 SHP, 21 knots
- HMS Invincible (1908): 41,000 SHP, 25 knots
- USS Delaware (1910): 25,000 SHP, 21 knots

## Compatible Ships
- Early dreadnought battleships
- Battlecruisers (WWI-era)
- Large armored cruisers
- Early fleet destroyers
