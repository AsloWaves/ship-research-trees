# High-Pressure Steam Turbine

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-014 |
| **Era** | 1935-1945 |
| **Power Output** | 35,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 75% |
| **Weight** | 210 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Oil |

## Description

High-pressure steam turbines represent the ultimate development of WWII-era steam propulsion technology. By using superheated steam at 850-900°F and 600+ PSI (compared to conventional 850°F/400 PSI), these turbines extract more energy per pound of steam, improving efficiency and power density. The high-pressure, high-temperature steam allows smaller, lighter turbines for equivalent power output.

Germany and Japan led development of high-pressure turbine technology, driven by resource constraints that made efficiency critical. German destroyers and Japanese cruisers pioneered the technology, achieving remarkable performance. However, the extreme operating conditions demanded precision manufacturing, exotic materials, and meticulous maintenance - challenges that proved difficult during wartime conditions.

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Very High | Best power density of steam |
| Efficiency | Excellent | Best thermal efficiency |
| Weight | Light | Compact for power output |
| Reliability | Moderate | Demanding operating conditions |
| Noise | Low | Smooth turbine operation |
| Maintenance | High | Precision systems, high wear |

## Advantages
- Best efficiency of any steam turbine
- Excellent power-to-weight ratio
- Compact machinery spaces
- Superior range/fuel economy
- Higher speeds for given displacement
- Less fuel needed for same mission

## Disadvantages
- Expensive and complex to manufacture
- Requires high-quality boiler tubes (chrome-molybdenum)
- High maintenance requirements
- Vulnerable to poor water quality
- Tube failures under combat stress
- Skilled crew essential
- Difficult to manufacture during wartime

## Historical Notes

The German Kriegsmarine pioneered high-pressure steam with destroyers like Z-1 (1937), achieving 70,000 SHP from compact machinery. The technology enabled German destroyers to match larger Allied destroyers in performance while using less fuel. Japan adopted similar systems for Mogami and Tone class cruisers, achieving 152,000 SHP and 35+ knots.

However, wartime experience revealed serious weaknesses. High-pressure boilers and turbines required exceptional maintenance and high-quality materials. German destroyers suffered frequent breakdowns during intensive operations. Japanese cruisers experienced tube failures during combat that reduced speed at critical moments. The systems performed brilliantly when properly maintained but proved fragile under wartime stress.

## Engineering Challenges

High-pressure systems demand:
- Chrome-molybdenum steel boiler tubes
- Precision turbine blade tolerances
- Exceptional water treatment (purity critical)
- Specialized training for engineering crews
- Frequent inspection and maintenance

## Famous Examples
- German Z-class destroyers: 70,000 SHP, 38 knots
- IJN Mogami: 152,000 SHP, 37 knots
- IJN Shimakaze: 79,000 SHP, 40+ knots (destroyer record)

## Compatible Ships
- German destroyers (Type 1934+)
- Japanese heavy cruisers (Mogami, Tone)
- Japanese destroyers (Kagero, Shimakaze)
- Advanced light cruisers

## Wartime Performance

Operational records showed:
- Excellent when well-maintained
- Vulnerable to damage and poor maintenance
- Frequent breakdowns under sustained operations
- Brilliant performance in ideal conditions
- Problematic reliability in extended campaigns

## Upgrade Path

← [[Geared-Turbine]] (conventional WWII)
→ [[Gas-Turbine]] (post-war revolution)
