# Turbo-Electric Drive

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-013 |
| **Era** | 1915-1945 |
| **Power Output** | 28,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 68% |
| **Weight** | 280 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Oil |

## Description

Turbo-electric drive uses steam turbines to spin electrical generators, which power electric motors connected to the propeller shafts. This arrangement decouples the turbines from the propellers entirely, allowing turbines to run at their optimal high RPM while propellers turn at their optimal low RPM. The electrical connection provides infinitely variable speed control and exceptional maneuverability.

The US Navy was the primary advocate of turbo-electric drive, installing it in battleships and carriers from 1915-1945. While heavier and more expensive than geared turbines, turbo-electric drive offered superior low-speed efficiency, better maneuverability, and simplified damage control. The system proved particularly valuable for aircraft carriers, where precise speed control during flight operations was essential.

## Performance Stats
```
Power Output:     28,000 SHP (per unit)
Acceleration:     Fast (2 minutes to full power)

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Very High | Equal to geared turbines |
| Efficiency | Good | Excellent at all speeds |
| Weight | Heavy | Generators and motors add weight |
| Reliability | Very Good | Redundancy benefits |
| Noise | Very Low | Electric motors nearly silent |
| Maintenance | Moderate | Complex but reliable systems |

## Advantages
- Excellent efficiency at all speeds (cruise to full)
- Infinitely variable speed control
- Superior maneuverability and station-keeping
- Can distribute power flexibly
- Redundancy (multiple generator/motor sets)
- No reduction gearing needed
- Reversing as simple as flipping switches

## Disadvantages
- Heavy (generators, motors, cables add weight)
- Expensive to manufacture
- Requires more internal volume
- Electrical system complexity
- Not as fast to accelerate as gas turbines
- Electrical losses reduce peak efficiency

## Historical Notes

The US Navy pioneered turbo-electric drive with USS New Mexico (1918), the first battleship with the system. The Navy installed it in all subsequent battleships through North Carolina class and all Lexington and Yorktown class carriers. The exceptional maneuverability proved invaluable for carriers conducting flight operations, allowing precise speed adjustments to control deck wind.

During WWII, turbo-electric battleships demonstrated superior fuel economy on long-range Pacific operations. The system's redundancy also proved valuable - ships could continue operating even with damaged motor or generator sets. However, post-war analysis showed geared turbines were lighter and cheaper for similar performance, and the US Navy abandoned turbo-electric drive after WWII.

## Famous Examples
- USS New Mexico (1918): 40,000 SHP, 21 knots
- USS Lexington (CV-2, 1927): 180,000 SHP, 33 knots
- USS North Carolina (1941): 121,000 SHP, 28 knots

## Carrier Application

Particularly valuable for aircraft carriers:
- Precise speed control for deck wind
- Smooth speed changes during launches
- Excellent station-keeping in task force
- Quick response to flight deck requirements

## Compatible Ships
- US battleships (1918-1941)
- US fleet carriers (1920s-1940s)
- Large cruisers
- Battlecruisers (hypothetical)

## Upgrade Path

← [[Curtis-Turbine]] (direct-drive predecessor)
→ [[Geared-Turbine]] (lighter alternative)
