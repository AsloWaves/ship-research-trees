# Opposed-Piston Diesel Engine

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-016 |
| **Era** | 1935-Present |
| **Power Output** | 6,500 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 88% |
| **Weight** | 70 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Diesel |

## Description

The opposed-piston diesel engine uses a revolutionary design where two pistons operate in the same cylinder, moving toward and away from each other. Instead of a cylinder head with valves, combustion occurs between the two piston crowns. This eliminates the cylinder head entirely, reducing weight and complexity while improving thermal efficiency. The design also allows two crankshafts (one for each piston set), enabling higher power density.

Fairbanks-Morse pioneered the practical opposed-piston diesel for submarine use, creating engines that delivered 30-60% more power than conventional diesels of similar size. The US Navy adopted these engines extensively for fleet submarines during and after WWII. The unique design provided excellent power density in the confined spaces of submarine engine rooms, while maintaining diesel economy for long-range Pacific patrols.

## Performance Stats
```
Power Output:     6,500 SHP (per engine)
Acceleration:     Moderate (2 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.21 kg diesel per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     3.4x (best diesel economy)
Configuration:    Two pistons per cylinder
Crankshafts:      Two (upper and lower)

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Medium | Excellent for size |
| Efficiency | Excellent | Best diesel efficiency |
| Weight | Medium | Better power density |
| Reliability | Good | Complex but proven |
| Noise | Moderate | Less than conventional diesel |
| Maintenance | Moderate-High | More complex internals |

## Advantages
- Higher power density than conventional diesels
- Excellent thermal efficiency (no cylinder head losses)
- Compact for submarine installation
- Outstanding fuel economy
- Two-stroke operation (power every revolution)
- Better balance than single-piston designs
- Proven in US submarine service

## Disadvantages
- More complex than conventional diesels
- Two crankshafts to maintain
- Specialized training required
- Limited manufacturers (Fairbanks-Morse primary)
- Higher initial cost
- More complex timing coordination
- Spare parts availability concerns

## Historical Notes

Fairbanks-Morse developed opposed-piston diesels in the 1930s, drawing on European Junkers aircraft engine concepts. The US Navy first installed them in submarines like USS Skipjack (SS-184) in 1938. The engines proved remarkably successful, combining high power with excellent economy. During WWII, they powered Gato, Balao, and Tench class submarines that dominated Pacific submarine warfare.

Post-war, opposed-piston diesels continued in US submarines until nuclear propulsion arrived. The engines enabled fleet submarines to patrol from Pearl Harbor to Japanese waters and back without refueling - a strategic advantage over shorter-range Axis submarines. The design remained in service in some US submarines into the 1970s, a testament to its reliability and efficiency.

## Technical Innovation

The opposed-piston design eliminates:
- Cylinder heads
- Valves and valve gear
- Valve timing complexity

This reduces:
- Weight by 15-20%
- Heat losses through cylinder head
- Maintenance complexity

## Famous Submarine Applications
- USS Gato class (1941): Four Fairbanks-Morse engines, 6,500 SHP total
- USS Balao class (1942): Four engines, 6,500 SHP total
- USS Tang class (1951): Three engines, 4,800 SHP total

## Opposed-Piston Advantages for Submarines

**Space Efficiency**: More power in limited engine room
**Reliability**: Fewer components to fail underwater
**Economy**: Critical for long Pacific patrols
**Low Height**: Fits submarine hull profile better

## Compatible Ships
- Fleet submarines (primary use)
- Diesel-electric submarines
- Fast attack submarines (pre-nuclear)
- Experimental patrol craft
- Special operations vessels
