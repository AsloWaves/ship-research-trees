# CODAG Propulsion

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-013 |
| **Type** | Combined Diesel and Gas |
| **Era** | 1960-2025 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 55,000 SHP |

## Description

Combined Diesel and Gas (CODAG) propulsion system using fuel-efficient diesel engines for cruising and powerful gas turbines for high-speed operation. Both systems can operate simultaneously, with diesels providing economical cruising while gas turbines add sprint capability. This configuration became the standard for modern frigates and destroyers requiring both long endurance and high speed.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power (Diesel)** | 10,000 SHP |
| **Power (Gas)** | 45,000 SHP |
| **Power (Combined)** | 55,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Fast |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Very Good |
| **Reliability** | 88% |
| **Noise Level** | Low-Moderate |

## Fuel Consumption

| Mode | Consumption | Range (est) |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Diesel cruise (15kt) | 1.2 tons/day | 8,000 nm |
| Combined (28kt) | 8.5 tons/day | 3,500 nm |
| Gas sprint (30kt+) | 15.0 tons/day | 2,000 nm |

## Suitable Ship Types

- Modern frigates
- Modern destroyers
- Corvettes (advanced)
- Offshore patrol vessels
- Fast attack craft
- Amphibious assault ships

## Advantages

- Excellent fuel efficiency on diesel cruise
- High speed available when needed
- Flexible power management (diesel/gas/both)
- Long range on diesel alone
- Rapid acceleration from cruise to sprint
- Quiet diesel operation for ASW patrol
- Gas turbines provide power boost
- Lower crew requirements than steam
- Compact installation saves hull space

## Disadvantages

- Complex power management systems
- Two different engine types to maintain
- Gas turbines consume fuel rapidly at high power
- More expensive than single engine type
- Requires specialized training for both systems
- Vulnerable to single-point failures in control systems
- Gas turbine exhaust very hot (IR signature)
- Limited sprint endurance on gas alone

## Historical Notes

CODAG emerged in the 1960s as navies sought to combine diesel efficiency with gas turbine power. The Royal Navy's Type 22 frigates (1979) pioneered the configuration with 2x Rolls-Royce Olympus gas turbines and 2x Paxman Valenta diesels. This combination gave 18-knot cruise with 4,500nm range, or 30-knot sprint capability.

German MEKO frigates demonstrated CODAG versatility from the 1980s onwards. The Bremen-class used 2x MTU diesels for patrol cruising and 2x GE LM2500 gas turbines for high-speed operations. This flexibility proved ideal for North Atlantic ASW patrols requiring long endurance but occasional high-speed intercepts.

Modern destroyers like Spanish F-100 class and Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen class use CODAG for optimal efficiency. The ability to cruise on diesel at 15 knots for weeks, then accelerate to 29 knots within minutes, provides tactical flexibility impossible with single engine types. Diesel operations are also much quieter, improving sonar performance during ASW operations.

The configuration's main advantage over COGAG (all gas turbines) is cruise efficiency. A destroyer on extended patrol can cruise 8,000nm on diesel fuel, versus 4,000nm if forced to use gas turbines. For area air defense or ASW picket duties, this endurance difference is crucial. The disadvantage is increased complexity - maintaining diesel and gas turbine systems requires different spare parts and expertise.

Future developments include hybrid-electric CODAG systems where diesel generators charge batteries for silent electric propulsion, with gas turbines for high-speed operations. This configuration combines CODAG's efficiency with improved quiet operations and power management flexibility.
