# Gas Turbine

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-007 |
| **Era** | 1960-Present |
| **Power Output** | 25,000 SHP per unit |
| **Efficiency** | 55% |
| **Weight** | 50 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Diesel/JP-5 |

## Description

Marine gas turbines are essentially jet engines adapted for ship propulsion. They offer extraordinary power-to-weight ratios and can reach full power in seconds rather than minutes. The LM2500, derived from aircraft engines, is the most common type.

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     25,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~35+ knots (depends on hull)
Acceleration:     Very Fast (30 seconds to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.45 kg fuel per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.5x
Sprint Duration:  Unlimited
```

## Characteristics

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Very High | Excellent for size |
| Efficiency | Moderate | Thirsty at high power |
| Weight | Very Light | Best power/weight ratio |
| Reliability | Excellent | Mature technology |
| Noise | Moderate | High-pitched whine |
| Maintenance | Low | Modular replacement |

## Special Feature: Sprint Capability

- 0 to full power in 30 seconds
- Instant response to throttle
- Can "sprint" to intercept or evade
- No warm-up time required

## Advantages

- Incredible power-to-weight ratio
- Lightning-fast acceleration
- Modular construction (swap entire engine)
- Compact machinery spaces
- No reduction in power at high speed

## Disadvantages

- High fuel consumption at full power
- Expensive to purchase
- Requires clean fuel
- Hot exhaust (IR signature)

## Historical Notes

Gas turbines revolutionized warship design in the 1970s. A modern frigate with gas turbines can accelerate faster than a WWII destroyer despite being twice the size. The US Navy's LM2500 has become the Western standard, while the Royal Navy pioneered the technology with HMS Exmouth (1968).

## Common Configurations

**COGAG** (Combined Gas and Gas):
- Two gas turbines, both for propulsion
- Maximum speed capability
- Higher fuel consumption

**CODAG** (Combined Diesel and Gas):
- Diesel for cruise, turbine for sprint
- Better fuel economy
- Modern standard

## Compatible Ships

- Modern destroyers
- Modern frigates
- Fast patrol boats
- Amphibious ships

## Upgrade Path

← [[Geared-Turbine]] (WWII standard)
→ [[CODAG-System]] (optimized)
