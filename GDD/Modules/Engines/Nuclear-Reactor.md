# Nuclear Reactor (Pressurized Water)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-009 |
| **Era** | 1955-Present |
| **Power Output** | 70,000 SHP per unit |
| **Efficiency** | Unlimited range |
| **Weight** | 500 tons (with shielding) |
| **Fuel Type** | Enriched Uranium |

## Description

A pressurized water reactor generates steam by controlled nuclear fission. The steam drives turbines connected to the propellers. Nuclear power provides virtually unlimited range - ships are limited only by crew endurance and consumables.

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     70,000 SHP (per reactor)
Max Ship Speed:   ~33+ knots (depends on hull)
Acceleration:     Slow (10 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: N/A (20+ year core life)
Range Factor:     Unlimited
Underwater:       Unlimited (submarines)
```

## Characteristics

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Extreme | Multiple reactors for carriers |
| Efficiency | Unlimited | No refueling for decades |
| Weight | Very Heavy | Shielding requirements |
| Reliability | Excellent | Mature technology |
| Noise | Low | When properly designed |
| Maintenance | Complex | Specialized crew required |

## Special Feature: Unlimited Range

- No fuel logistics required
- Can operate indefinitely
- Speed not limited by fuel conservation
- Submarines can remain submerged indefinitely
- Endurance limited only by food/crew

## Advantages

- Unlimited operational range
- No fuel vulnerability
- Maximum speed always available
- No exhaust (no IR signature)
- Submarines: true underwater performance

## Disadvantages

- Extremely heavy (shielding)
- Very expensive
- Requires highly trained crew
- Disposal/decommissioning complex
- Political/treaty restrictions

## Historical Notes

USS Nautilus (1954) proved nuclear propulsion viable for submarines. USS Enterprise (1961) demonstrated it for carriers. Nuclear power transformed submarine warfare - boats could finally operate as true submarines rather than submersibles. Nuclear carriers can conduct high-speed operations indefinitely.

## Ship Requirements

Nuclear reactors require:
- Minimum hull size (destroyer+)
- Specialized crew quarters
- Radiation monitoring systems
- Emergency cooling systems

## Compatible Ships

- Aircraft carriers (2+ reactors)
- Submarines
- Cruisers (historical: CGN)
- Icebreakers

## Submarine Advantage

```
Submerged Speed:  25+ knots (unlimited)
Submerged Time:   Unlimited (air recycling)
Detection:        Very low when silent
Sprint/Drift:     True high-speed evasion
```

## Upgrade Path

← [[Diesel-Electric-Drive]] (submarines)
← [[Geared-Turbine]] (surface ships)
