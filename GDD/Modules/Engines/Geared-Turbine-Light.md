# Geared Turbine (Light)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-007 |
| **Type** | Geared Steam Turbine |
| **Era** | 1920-1960 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 30,000 SHP |

## Description

Light geared turbine optimized for destroyers and light cruisers. Reduction gearing allows the turbine to spin at high RPM for efficiency while driving the propeller at optimal low RPM. This configuration became the standard destroyer powerplant from the 1920s through the end of WWII, offering excellent power-to-weight ratio and rapid acceleration.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 30,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Fast |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Excellent |
| **Reliability** | 88% |
| **Noise Level** | Low |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (15kt) | 2.0 tons/day | 6,500 nm |
| Flank (35kt) | 12.0 tons/day | 2,500 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     30,000 SHP (per turbine set)
Max Ship Speed:   ~35 knots (destroyer hulls)
Acceleration:     Fast (2 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.35 kg oil per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     2.2x (excellent efficiency)
Vibration:        Minimal
Weight/Power:     4.0 kg per SHP (excellent ratio)
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Fleet destroyers (WWII)
- Destroyer escorts
- Light cruisers
- Fast attack craft
- Destroyer leaders
- Frigates (late WWII/post-war)

## Advantages

- Excellent power-to-weight ratio for speed
- Outstanding fuel efficiency at all speeds
- Rapid acceleration for tactical maneuvers
- Compact installation saves hull space
- Smooth operation aids sensor performance
- Reliable gearing technology by WWII
- Good performance across entire speed range

## Disadvantages

- Gearbox vulnerable to shock damage from near misses
- Complex maintenance requires skilled crew
- No reverse without astern turbine
- Expensive precision gearing
- Steam plant still requires large crew
- Oil fuel vulnerability in combat
- Catastrophic failure if gearing fails

## Historical Notes

Light geared turbines revolutionized destroyer design in the 1920s. USS Farragut (DD-348, 1934), first of the modern US destroyer class, used paired 21,000 SHP geared turbines achieving 36.5 knots on 1,395 tons displacement. British Tribal-class destroyers (1938) demonstrated similar performance with 44,000 SHP total from paired light turbines.

The Fletcher-class destroyer, backbone of the US WWII fleet, mounted paired 30,000 SHP geared turbines achieving 38 knots. The combination of high power, excellent fuel efficiency, and rapid acceleration made these destroyers effective across all combat roles. Japanese Kagero-class destroyers used similar configurations with slightly higher power for increased speed.

Geared turbine reliability proved crucial during the Pacific War's long-range operations. Destroyers routinely steamed thousands of miles at economical cruising speed, then sprinted to 35+ knots for combat. The efficiency advantage over earlier direct-drive turbines extended operational radius by 50% or more.

Post-WWII destroyers continued using geared turbines into the 1960s. British Daring-class (1952) and US Forrest Sherman-class (1955) destroyers represented the peak of steam turbine destroyer design before gas turbines began replacing them. Many geared turbine destroyers served into the 1980s, testament to the design's longevity.
