# Triple Expansion Engine (Medium)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-002 |
| **Type** | Reciprocating Steam |
| **Era** | 1880-1920 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 15,000 SHP |

## Description

Standard triple expansion engine for cruisers and secondary battleship applications. Represents the mature development of reciprocating steam technology with optimized cylinder ratios and valve timing. This medium variant balances power, efficiency, and reliability for mid-sized warships.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 15,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Slow |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Good |
| **Reliability** | 90% |
| **Noise Level** | Moderate |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (12kt) | 5.0 tons/day | 4,500 nm |
| Flank (21kt) | 18.0 tons/day | 1,200 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     15,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~21 knots (depends on hull)
Acceleration:     Slow (5 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.72 kg coal per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.2x (improved efficiency)
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Armored cruisers
- Protected cruisers
- Light cruisers (early)
- Second-class battleships
- Armed merchant cruisers

## Advantages

- Well-proven, mature technology
- Excellent reliability record
- Fully reversible without auxiliary machinery
- Good fuel efficiency at cruising speed
- Easy to maintain with standard parts
- Smooth power delivery at design RPM

## Disadvantages

- Heavy machinery spaces reduce payload
- Slow acceleration limits tactical flexibility
- Coal handling requires large stoker crew
- Vibration increases with power
- Limited top speed compared to turbines
- Requires extensive boiler support

## Historical Notes

Medium triple expansion engines were the workhorses of pre-dreadnought cruiser fleets worldwide. The British Navy's County-class cruisers used pairs of these engines to achieve 23 knots on 21,000 SHP total. German protected cruisers like SMS Niobe demonstrated the type's reliability during extended overseas deployments.

The USS Olympia (1895), Commodore Dewey's flagship at Manila Bay, mounted twin 15,000 SHP triple expansion engines that proved flawlessly reliable despite tropical conditions. These engines represented the peak of reciprocating technology, achieving 45% thermal efficiency through precise cylinder design and advanced valve timing.

By 1910, turbines began replacing reciprocating engines in new cruiser construction, but many triple expansion cruisers served through WWI and beyond. Their reliability and ease of maintenance made them valuable for convoy escort and patrol duties where ultimate speed was less critical than dependability.

## Compatible Ships

- Protected cruisers (1890-1910)
- Armored cruisers (1895-1910)
- Early light cruisers
