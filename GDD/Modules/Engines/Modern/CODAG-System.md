# CODAG Propulsion System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-017 |
| **Era** | 1980-Present |
| **Power Output** | 32,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 72% |
| **Weight** | 95 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Diesel/Marine Gas Turbine Fuel |

## Description

CODAG (Combined Diesel And Gas) represents the optimal balance between fuel economy and high-performance capability in modern warships. The system combines fuel-efficient diesel engines for cruising with powerful gas turbines for high-speed operations. Ships cruise on diesels at economical speeds, then engage gas turbines when high speed is needed - getting the best of both worlds without the compromises of pure diesel or pure turbine propulsion.

A typical CODAG configuration uses two medium-speed diesels (6,000-8,000 HP each) for cruise speeds up to 18-20 knots, with two gas turbines (20,000-25,000 HP each) providing boost power for speeds above 25 knots. Advanced clutching systems allow smooth transition between modes, and both powerplants can operate simultaneously for maximum speed. This flexibility makes CODAG the international standard for modern frigates and destroyers.

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Very High | Combined output impressive |
| Efficiency | Good | Diesel cruise economical |
| Weight | Light-Medium | Better than pure diesel |
| Reliability | Excellent | Redundancy built-in |
| Noise | Low-Moderate | Depends on mode |
| Maintenance | Moderate | Two different systems |

## Operating Modes

**Diesel-Only Mode** (0-20 knots):
- Maximum fuel economy
- Low noise signature
- Long-range patrol capability
- Both diesels at optimal RPM

**Gas-Only Mode** (25-30+ knots):
- Maximum speed
- Rapid acceleration
- Higher fuel consumption
- Sprint capability

**Combined Mode** (20-25 knots):
- All engines operating
- Maximum power available
- Flexible power distribution
- Optimal for combat operations

## Advantages
- Best fuel economy at cruise speeds
- High-speed sprint capability when needed
- Flexible power distribution
- Excellent reliability (redundant systems)
- Long range on diesel, speed when needed
- Lower infrared signature than full gas turbines
- Proven international standard
- Reduces total fuel consumption vs pure gas turbines

## Disadvantages
- More complex than single-type systems
- Requires maintenance of two engine types
- Higher initial cost than simple diesels
- Control system complexity
- More internal volume than pure turbines
- Clutching/gearing systems add weight

## Historical Notes

CODAG emerged in the 1970s-1980s as fuel costs soared and navies sought alternatives to fuel-hungry pure gas turbine ships. The Royal Navy experimented with combined systems in Type 22 frigates, while Germany pioneered CODAG in MEKO frigates. The 1991 Gulf War demonstrated the concept's value when coalition ships maintained station for months on diesel economy, then sprinted to intercept threats using gas turbines.

Today, CODAG is the international standard for modern surface combatants. Most NATO frigates and many destroyers use variants of CODAG, typically with MTU diesels and LM2500 gas turbines. The system represents mature, proven technology that optimally balances the competing demands of range, speed, and economy.

## Power Distribution Examples

**Type 31 Frigate (UK)**:
- 4x MTU 20V 4000 M53B diesels: 9,100 HP each
- Cruise: 18 knots on 2 diesels
- Max: 28+ knots on all diesels

**MEKO A-200 Frigate**:
- 2x MTU diesels: 8,000 HP each
- 1x LM2500 gas turbine: 25,000 HP
- Cruise: 18 knots diesel
- Sprint: 29+ knots combined

## Tactical Advantages

**Patrol**: Silent diesel loiter with excellent endurance
**Response**: Rapid gas turbine acceleration to intercept
**Combat**: Combined power for maneuverability
**Economy**: Diesel cruise extends operational radius dramatically

## Compatible Ships
- Modern frigates (primary application)
- Destroyers (some classes)
- Corvettes (scaled versions)
- Offshore patrol vessels
- Coast guard cutters
- Fast attack craft (large)

## Comparison to Alternatives

vs **Pure Gas Turbine (COGAG)**:
- CODAG: Better range, lower fuel costs
- COGAG: Simpler, lighter, faster

vs **Pure Diesel**:
- CODAG: Higher top speed, better acceleration
- Diesel: Simpler, cheaper initial cost

vs **Nuclear**:
- CODAG: Lower cost, more flexibility
- Nuclear: Unlimited range, higher sustained speed

← [[Diesel-Electric-Drive]] (pure diesel)
→ Future: Hybrid-electric CODLAG systems
