# Triple Expansion Steam Engine

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-001 |
| **Era** | 1880-1915 |
| **Power Output** | 3,000 SHP per unit |
| **Efficiency** | 40% |
| **Weight** | 150 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Coal |

## Description

The triple expansion engine uses steam three times at progressively lower pressures through high, intermediate, and low pressure cylinders. This design extracts maximum energy from steam and was the standard warship powerplant before turbines.

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     3,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~16 knots (depends on hull)
Acceleration:     Slow (5 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.8 kg coal per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.0x (baseline)
```

## Characteristics

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Low | Adequate for pre-dreadnoughts |
| Efficiency | Poor | High coal consumption |
| Weight | Heavy | Large machinery spaces |
| Reliability | High | Simple, proven design |
| Noise | Moderate | Rhythmic pounding |
| Maintenance | Moderate | Regular bearing maintenance |

## Advantages

- Proven, reliable technology
- Simple to operate and maintain
- Reversible (important for maneuvering)
- Parts availability (common design)

## Disadvantages

- Low power-to-weight ratio
- Slow acceleration
- High fuel consumption
- Requires coal (dirty, labor-intensive)
- Large engine room footprint

## Historical Notes

Triple expansion engines powered the world's battlefleets from 1880-1910. The design was perfected to extract ~40% thermal efficiency - remarkable for the era. However, the reciprocating motion caused vibration that affected gunnery accuracy at high speeds.

## Compatible Ships

- Pre-dreadnought battleships
- Armored cruisers
- Protected cruisers
- Early destroyers (torpedo boats)

## Upgrade Path

→ [[Quadruple-Expansion-Engine]] (more power)
→ [[Parsons-Turbine]] (revolutionary upgrade)
