# Special Systems Modules

Special systems represent unique capabilities that don't fit neatly into other categories. These modules enable aircraft operations, shore parties, minelaying, anti-submarine warfare, and logistics - the "Swiss Army knife" capabilities that transform a warship from a gun platform into a complete naval combatant.

- Basic mine rails
- No aircraft

### Interwar Period (1920-1940)
- Floatplane catapults emerge
- Hangars for weather protection
- Depth charges developed
- Motor launches replace sailing boats

### WWII Era (1940-1945)
- Floatplane operations mature
- Hedgehog revolutionizes ASW
- Depth charges standard on escorts
- Torpedo reloads emphasized (especially Japan)
- Minelaying widespread

### Early Cold War (1950-1965)

## Tactical Applications

### Force Projection
- **Aircraft**: Extend sensors and weapons 100+ km
- **Boats**: Land shore parties, conduct raids
- **Mines**: Deny areas to enemy, control straits
- **Helicopters**: Insert special operations forces

### Anti-Submarine Warfare
- **Depth Charges**: Classic ASW weapon, 1915-1970
- **Hedgehog**: Ahead-throwing, maintains sonar contact
- **Helicopters**: Modern standoff ASW platform
- **Torpedoes**: Primary modern ASW weapon

### Sustained Operations
- **Torpedo Reloads**: Multiple engagements vs. one-shot
- **VERTREP**: Resupply without port visit
- **Boat Operations**: Ship-to-ship transfer
- **Aviation**: Extended operations with maintenance

### Special Operations
- **RHIBs**: High-speed boarding, SOF insertion
- **Helicopters**: Vertical assault, extraction
- **Mines**: Covert area denial
- **Boats**: Reconnaissance, raids

## Design Philosophy

### Versatility Over Specialization
Special systems make ships more versatile:
- Destroyer with helicopter: Also effective ASW platform
- Cruiser with boats: Can conduct shore operations
- Minelayer: Creates persistent area denial
- Ship with VERTREP: Logistically independent

### Historical Authenticity
Systems reflect actual capabilities:
- Floatplanes obsolete after radar widespread
- Depth charges replaced by homing torpedoes
- Helicopters revolutionized ASW
- RHIBs transformed boarding operations

### Meaningful Choices
Players choose based on mission:
- ASW mission: Hedgehog + torpedoes
- Scouting mission: Floatplane/helicopter
- Special ops: Boats + helicopters
- Offensive mining: Mine rails

## Module Synergies

## Gameplay Considerations

### Resource Management
Special systems consume resources:
- **Aircraft**: Fuel, ammunition, maintenance
- **Boats**: Fuel, crew assignment
- **Depth charges**: Finite ammunition
- **Torpedoes**: Expensive, limited capacity
- **Mines**: Finite load, must plan carefully

### Risk vs. Reward
Operations carry risks:
- **Aircraft**: Can be shot down, lost to weather
- **Boats**: Vulnerable to enemy fire, weather
- **Mine Laying**: Ship vulnerable during operation
- **ASW**: Must close with dangerous enemy

### Skill-Based Gameplay
Effective use requires skill:
- **Aviation**: Launch timing, mission planning
- **ASW**: Sonar interpretation, attack geometry
- **Mines**: Pattern planning, navigation
- **Boats**: Weather judgment, tactical employment
