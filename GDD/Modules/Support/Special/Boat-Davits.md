# Boat Davits

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-008 |
| **Era** | 1800-Present |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 8,000 kg (davits + boats) |
| **Crew Required** | 4 (boat crews) |

## Description

Davits and stowage for ship's boats enabling launch and recovery of small craft. Boats serve countless purposes: ship-to-ship transfer, shore parties, rescue operations, inspection, recreation, and emergency lifeboats. Davits provide mechanical advantage to lower heavy boats to water and recover them, a capability essential for extended operations away from port.

## Effect on Gameplay

Enables shore party landings, rescue operations, ship-to-ship transfers, and emergency evacuation. Boats extend your ship's reach to shore or other vessels. Critical for missions requiring personnel deployment, reconnaissance, boarding parties, or evacuation. Also serves as emergency lifesaving capability if ship must be abandoned.

## Davit Types

### Gravity Davits (Traditional)
- **Mechanism**: Boat pivots out on arms, lowers by gravity
- **Advantages**: Simple, reliable, no power
- **Disadvantages**: Slow, requires crew strength
- **Era**: 1850s-1950s primary, still used

### Quadrant Davits
- **Mechanism**: Curved arms swing out, winch lowers boat
- **Advantages**: Mechanical advantage, faster
- **Disadvantages**: More complex
- **Era**: Early 1900s+

### Crane Davits
- **Mechanism**: Shipboard crane lifts and lowers boats
- **Advantages**: Very fast, high capacity, flexible
- **Disadvantages**: Requires power, single point failure
- **Era**: 1950s+ for large ships

### Modern RHIB Davits
- **Mechanism**: Hydraulic or electric launch/recovery
- **Advantages**: Very fast, all-weather capable
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, power dependent
- **Era**: 1980s+

## Davit Operations

### Launch Procedure
1. **Uncover boat**: Remove tarpaulins, secure gear
2. **Swing out**: Rotate davits to outboard position
3. **Man boat**: Crew boards before lowering (or after for RHIBs)
4. **Lower**: Winch lowers boat to water
5. **Release**: Hooks released, boat free
6. **Cast off**: Boat clears ship's side
- **Time**: 3-5 minutes with trained crew

### Recovery Procedure
1. **Approach**: Boat comes alongside
2. **Hook on**: Crew attaches davit hooks
3. **Hoist**: Winch lifts boat from water
4. **Swing in**: Davits rotate inboard
5. **Secure**: Boat seated in cradle, lashed down
6. **Cover**: Tarpaulins replaced
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Weather Limitations
- **Sea State 0-2**: Easy operations
- **Sea State 3-4**: Difficult, possible with skill
- **Sea State 5+**: Dangerous, generally not attempted
- **High speed**: Cannot launch while ship moving fast
- **Night**: Possible with training and lights

## Mission Profiles

### Shore Parties
- **Purpose**: Landing personnel on shore
- **Typical use**: Reconnaissance, liaison, recreation
- **Size**: 10-30 personnel per boat
- **Equipment**: Small arms, radio, supplies
- **Duration**: Hours to days

### Rescue Operations
- **Purpose**: Recover survivors from water
- **Range**: Several km from ship
- **Capacity**: 15-40 per boat
- **Equipment**: First aid, rescue gear
- **Urgency**: Rapid launch critical

### Boarding Parties
- **Purpose**: Board and inspect other vessels
- **Type**: RHIBs preferred (speed)
- **Personnel**: Armed inspection teams
- **Equipment**: Weapons, boarding ladders, radios
- **Doctrine**: Anti-piracy, sanctions enforcement

### Ship-to-Ship Transfer
- **Purpose**: Personnel or cargo transfer
- **Conditions**: Calmer seas needed
- **Typical**: Officer conferences, medical evacuations
- **Alternative**: Helicopter (if available)

### Underwater Inspection
- **Purpose**: Check ship's hull
- **Personnel**: Divers + support crew
- **Equipment**: Diving gear, underwater lights
- **Use**: Damage assessment, mine clearance

### Emergency Evacuation
- **Purpose**: Abandon ship
- **Capacity**: All crew (multiple trips if needed)
- **Priority**: Wounded first, then remaining crew
- **Supplies**: Survival gear, water, rations

## Tactical Applications

### Force Projection
- Demonstrate ability to land forces
- Small-scale amphibious operations

- Search and rescue

## Advantages

- Versatile capability
- Extends ship's reach to shore
- Essential for some missions (boarding, inspection)
- Evacuation capability (safety)
- Personnel morale (liberty, shore time)
- Ship-to-ship transfer capability
- Rescue operations
- Relatively inexpensive

## Limitations

- Weather dependent (cannot operate in rough seas)
- Vulnerable (lightly armed, slow boats)
- Requires crew (diverts personnel from ship duties)
- Time consuming (launch/recovery)
- Maintenance intensive (marine environment)

- Cannot launch at high ship speed

## Without Boats

Ships lacking boat capability:
- Cannot conduct shore landings
- Very limited rescue capability
- No ship-to-ship transfer ability
- Cannot inspect other vessels
- Reduced evacuation capability
- Limited to helicopter-only operations
- Significant capability gap

## Historical Notes

Ship's boats have been essential since the age of sail. Boats allowed ships to approach shallow waters, conduct surveys, maintain communications, and land parties. The advent of steam didn't eliminate boats - they remained essential for myriad tasks.

WWII saw extensive boat operations. Landing craft were specialized boats for amphibious assaults. Ship's boats conducted rescues, shore parties, and transfers throughout the war. The motor whaleboat became standard on U.S. Navy ships.

Post-war, boats remained important. The Pueblo Incident (1968) involved North Korean boats capturing USS Pueblo. Vietnam "brown water navy" operations used boats extensively. The RIB revolution in the 1970s-80s provided high-speed capability previous boats lacked.

Modern operations emphasize boats for maritime security. Anti-piracy operations off Somalia relied heavily on RHIBs for boarding suspect vessels. Navy SEALs use advanced RHIBs for special operations. Even modern destroyers carry at least 2 RHIBs for boarding and inspection.

The traditional davit-launched motor launch has given way to RHIBs on many warships, but the fundamental capability - deploying personnel in small boats - remains as relevant as ever. Future developments may include unmanned boats for some missions, but manned boats will continue serving for the foreseeable future.
