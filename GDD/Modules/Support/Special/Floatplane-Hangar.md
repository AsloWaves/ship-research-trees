# Floatplane Hangar

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-001 |
| **Era** | 1920-1950 |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 25,000 kg |
| **Crew Required** | 12 (aviation personnel) |

## Description

Enclosed hangar facility for housing and maintaining scout floatplanes. Provides weather protection, maintenance workshops, and ammunition/fuel storage for shipboard aircraft operations. More sophisticated than simple catapult systems, the hangar enables extended aviation operations with multiple aircraft and full maintenance capability.

## Effect on Gameplay

Enables operation of 2-4 scout floatplanes instead of the single aircraft carried by basic catapult systems. Aircraft are maintained in ready condition, protected from weather damage, and can be rapidly serviced and relaunched. Significantly extends reconnaissance and spotting capabilities compared to single-catapult installations.

## Specifications

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Aircraft Capacity** | 2-4 floatplanes |
| **Storage Type** | Fully enclosed hangar |
| **Maintenance Facilities** | Complete workshop |
| **Fuel Storage** | 5,000 liters aviation fuel |
| **Ammunition Storage** | Small bombs, machine gun ammo |
| **Crane Capacity** | 5 tons (aircraft recovery) |
| **Hangar Dimensions** | 15m x 10m x 5m typical |
| **Fire Suppression** | Foam system |

## Facilities

### Hangar Deck
- **Enclosed space**: Weather protection
- **Roll-on access**: Aircraft moved on dollies
- **Ventilation**: Fuel vapor removal
- **Fire suppression**: Automated foam system
- **Heating/cooling**: Climate control (modern)
- **Lighting**: Work lights for night operations

### Maintenance Workshop
- **Engine maintenance**: Overhaul capability
- **Airframe repair**: Structural work
- **Electrical shop**: Radio and systems repair
- **Fabric/dope**: Covering repair (fabric aircraft)
- **Paint shop**: Corrosion prevention
- **Tool storage**: Complete aircraft toolkit

### Support Facilities
- **Parts storage**: Spare components
- **Fuel bunkers**: Aviation gasoline
- **Oil storage**: Engine lubricants
- **Ammunition magazines**: Bombs and gun ammo
- **Life raft storage**: Aircrew survival gear
- **Ready room**: Aircrew briefing space

## Aircraft Operations

### Launch Sequence
1. **Pre-flight**: Maintenance crew prepares aircraft
2. **Move to catapult**: Roll from hangar to launcher
3. **Fuel and arm**: Top off tanks, load weapons
4. **Crew boards**: Pilot and observer
5. **Launch**: Catapult fires (2 minutes)

### Recovery Sequence
1. **Water landing**: Aircraft lands alongside
2. **Crane pickup**: Hook aircraft, lift to deck
3. **Move to hangar**: Roll into enclosed space
4. **Maintenance**: Post-flight inspection and service
5. **Rearm/refuel**: Prepare for next sortie (30 minutes)

### Turnaround Time
- **Quick turnaround**: 20 minutes (refuel only)
- **Standard turnaround**: 45 minutes (full service)
- **Major service**: 4 hours (engine work, etc.)

## Advantages Over Catapult-Only

### Multiple Aircraft
- 2-4 aircraft vs. 1 for basic catapult
- Continuous operations (launch while recovering)
- Redundancy if one aircraft damaged
- Simultaneous searches in multiple sectors

### Maintenance Capability
- Full overhaul capacity
- Rapid fault diagnosis and repair
- Protected workspace
- Parts and tools readily available
- Extends aircraft service life

### Weather Protection
- Aircraft protected from saltwater corrosion
- No storm damage while stored
- Longer component life
- Higher readiness rate

### Operational Flexibility
- Longer range missions (full fuel)
- Armed scout missions (bombs/depth charges)
- Multiple missions per day
- Night operations (with preparation)

## Aircraft Types Supported

### Light Scouts
- **SOC Seagull** (USA): 2-seat scout, 1000 km range
- **Walrus** (UK): Versatile amphibian, rescue capable
- **Arado Ar 196** (Germany): Armed scout, good fighter

### Long-Range Scouts
- **OS2U Kingfisher** (USA): Extended range, night ops
- **E13A "Jake"** (Japan): 2100 km range, long searches
- **Loire 130** (France): Good endurance

## Tactical Applications

### Extended Reconnaissance
- Multiple aircraft cover more area
- Continuous search (rotate aircraft)
- Over-the-horizon intelligence
- Enemy fleet tracking

### Gunnery Spotting
- Observe fall of shot at extreme range
- Radio corrections to firing ship
- Critical for beyond-visual-range gunnery
- Multiple spotters for salvo firing

### Anti-Submarine Patrol
- Armed with depth charges
- Local area ASW search
- Convoy escort support
- U-boat deterrence

### Air-Sea Rescue
- Locate survivors
- Drop life rafts and supplies
- Guide rescue vessels
- Morale factor for crew

## Limitations

- Large, heavy installation (major design impact)
- Vulnerable to battle damage
- Aircraft vulnerable to enemy fighters
- High maintenance workload
- Fuel/ammo storage creates fire/explosion risk
- Obsolete after radar widespread (1945+)
- Limited in rough seas (launch/recovery dangerous)
- Requires trained aviation personnel

## Historical Notes

Floatplane hangars appeared on cruisers and battleships in the 1920s-30s as aviation became essential for fleet operations. The hangar protected aircraft from weather and enabled proper maintenance - open-deck storage caused rapid deterioration in the marine environment.

Major warships carried impressive aviation facilities. USS California (battleship) had enclosed hangars for multiple aircraft. British County-class cruisers featured hangar facilities amidships. Japanese cruisers emphasized aviation, with some carrying 5+ aircraft in hangars.

During WWII, shipboard aviation proved invaluable before radar became widespread. At the Battle of the River Plate (1939), British cruisers used float planes to track Graf Spee. Japanese cruisers used their excellent floatplanes extensively for scouting. The U.S. Navy's floatplane scouts served throughout the Pacific.

The advent of radar reduced floatplane value - radar provided all-weather, 24/7 detection without risking aircraft and crew. By 1945, most navies were removing floatplane facilities to mount more AA guns. Post-war, helicopters replaced floatplanes for the few ships still operating aircraft, as helicopters needed no catapult or water landing.

Some late cruisers like USS Worcester briefly carried helicopters in floatplane hangars, demonstrating the transition. Modern ships with hangars carry helicopters exclusively, but the fundamental concept - enclosed, maintained aircraft facility - remains unchanged.
