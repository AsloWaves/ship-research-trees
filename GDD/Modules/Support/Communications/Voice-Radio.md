# Voice Radio (TBS)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SUP-012 |
| **Era** | 1930-Present |
| **Category** | Communication |
| **Weight** | 200 kg |
| **Crew Required** | 1 |

## Description

Talk Between Ships (TBS) radio enables real-time voice communication. Unlike Morse code, voice radio allows immediate, intuitive coordination. Essential for fleet operations and combined arms tactics.

## Effect on Fog of War

**Enables Vision Sharing!**

When allied ships both have Voice Radio:
- Share radar contact information
- Coordinate targeting
- Pass position updates
- Real-time tactical coordination

```
Link Range:           50+ km (HF)
Link Quality:         Clear voice
Update Speed:         Real-time
Interception Risk:    Enemy can listen
```

## Effect on UI

When installed with CIC Bridge:
- **Voice Chat**: Enabled with team
- **Contact Sharing**: See allied radar contacts
- **Coordinate System**: Mark positions for allies
- **Quick Commands**: Voice macros

## Communication Range

| Type | Range | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| TBS (VHF) | 20-30 km | Line of sight |
| HF Radio | 100+ km | Over horizon |
| UHF | 50 km | Clear, short range |

## The Vision Sharing Mechanic

**Without Voice Radio:**
- You only see YOUR sensor contacts
- Allies are dots on map
- No coordination possible

**With Voice Radio:**
- Allied radar contacts appear on YOUR minimap
- Combined sensor coverage
- True fleet operations enabled

## Tactical Use

1. **Scouting**: Destroyer shares contacts with battleship
2. **Air Defense**: Pickets warn carrier group
3. **Coordination**: Synchronized torpedo attacks
4. **Rescue**: Communicate survivor positions

## Limitations

- Enemy can intercept (unless encrypted)
- Can be jammed
- Requires operator attention
- VHF limited to line of sight
- Voice discipline required (chatter = problems)

## Historical Notes

TBS revolutionized naval tactics in WWII. Previously, fleets communicated by flag signals and flashing light - slow and limited. Voice radio enabled the complex task force operations that dominated the Pacific war. The USN's superior communications were a significant advantage.
