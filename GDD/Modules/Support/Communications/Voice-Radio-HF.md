# HF Voice Radio

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | COM-003 |
| **Era** | 1935+ |
| **Category** | Communications |
| **Weight** | 350 kg |

## Description

High Frequency (3-30 MHz) voice radio for beyond-visual-range communication. HF signals bounce off the ionosphere, enabling ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication over hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Unlike VHF line-of-sight systems, HF provides true strategic coordination across ocean basins, though at the cost of potential congestion and atmospheric interference.

HF radio enabled the battle group concept - carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers could coordinate across hundreds of kilometers. Shore commands could issue orders to forces at sea. The system transformed naval operations from visual-range tactics to strategic theater-wide coordination.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Long Range Voice**: Communicate with allies 500km+ away
- **Strategic Coordination**: Fleet-wide orders and updates
- **Shore Contact**: Receive mission updates from command
- **Weather Updates**: Real-time meteorological data
- **Atmospheric Interference**: Occasional static/fadeout

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Range | 500-2000 km (skip propagation) |
| Range (direct) | 50 km line-of-sight |
| Frequency | 3-30 MHz |
| Voice Quality | Good (some static) |
| Power | 15 kW transmission |
| Crew | 1 radio operator |
| Interception | Enemy can monitor |
| Jamming Vulnerability | Moderate |

## Advantages

- Beyond-horizon communication
- Strategic range (hundreds of kilometers)
- Voice communication (intuitive and fast)
- Can contact shore stations
- Multi-channel capability
- Works day and night
- Essential for fleet coordination
- Enables task force operations

## Disadvantages

- Atmospheric interference (skip fading)
- Frequencies can be crowded
- Enemy can intercept
- Requires frequency management
- Ionospheric conditions affect propagation
- Higher power consumption than VHF
- Larger antenna requirements
- Not secure unless encrypted

## Historical Notes

HF voice radio matured in the late 1930s, revolutionizing naval warfare. During WWII, carrier task forces relied on HF for coordination across vast Pacific distances. Admiral Nimitz coordinated submarine wolfpacks against Japanese convoys using HF communications networks.

The Battle of the Atlantic saw both sides use HF - Allied shore stations directed escorts to convoy positions, while German U-boat command coordinated wolfpack attacks. British HF direction finding (Huff-Duff) could locate transmitting U-boats, making HF a double-edged sword.

Post-war, HF remained critical for strategic naval communication until satellite systems emerged in the 1970s-80s. Modern navies maintain HF as backup for when satellite links fail.

## Tactical Tips

- Use for strategic coordination beyond 50km
- Switch to VHF for local tactical communication
- Be aware enemies may monitor frequencies
- Use brevity codes to minimize transmission time
- Atmospheric conditions affect range - night often better
- Keep transmissions short to avoid direction finding
- Coordinate frequency plans with allies beforehand
- HF reveals you're in the area (though not precise location)
- Consider using encrypted overlay if available
- Essential for missions far from base
