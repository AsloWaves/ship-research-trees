# Pumping System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | DCM-003 |
| **Era** | All Eras |
| **Category** | Damage Control |
| **Weight** | 8,000 kg |

## Description

Comprehensive dewatering and flooding control system featuring high-capacity pumps, drainage piping, and remote-controlled valves. The system removes water from damaged compartments, manages intentional counterflooding for stability correction, and can transfer liquids between tanks. Large centrifugal pumps handle massive water volumes, while smaller submersible pumps reach tight spaces. The system is critical for ship survival after hull breaches, sprung plates, or torpedo damage.

Advanced pumping systems include cross-connected piping allowing any pump to serve any compartment, damage control computers calculating optimal counterflooding, and emergency portable pumps for backup. Steam-powered pumps on early ships gave way to electric systems, though modern vessels maintain diesel-powered emergency pumps for use when main power fails.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Flooding Control**: +60% faster dewatering
- **Counterflooding**: Automated stability correction
- **Survivability**: Recover from severe flooding damage
- **Pump Capacity**: 1000+ gallons per minute
- **Remote Control**: Operate valves from damage control center

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Main Pump Capacity | 1000-2000 GPM per pump |
| Number of Pumps | 4-8 (depending on ship size) |
| Portable Pumps | 2-4 @ 200 GPM each |
| Dewatering Speed | 60% faster than manual |
| Counterflood Time | 5-10 minutes for list correction |
| Cross-Connection | Any pump serves any compartment |
| Emergency Power | Diesel backup pumps |

## Advantages

- Essential for surviving torpedo/mine damage
- Dramatically faster than manual pumping
- Enables counterflooding for stability
- Can save ship that would otherwise sink
- Cross-connected system provides redundancy
- Remote valve control from DC center
- Large capacity handles severe flooding
- Emergency pumps work without main power
- Critical for any combat vessel
- Can pump fuel/water between tanks for trim

## Disadvantages

- Very high power consumption when operating
- Heavy system (affects ship design)
- Piping vulnerable to battle damage
- Pumps can be disabled by flooding they're meant to fight
- Requires skilled operators
- Cannot pump faster than water enters (severe damage)
- Electrical pumps fail without power
- Maintenance intensive
- Salt water corrodes systems
- Limited by pipe/pump capacity

## Historical Notes

Pumping systems have always been critical for ship survival. HMS Warspite at Jutland (1916) took 13 inch shell hits below the waterline but survived through effective pumping. Conversely, HMS Hood's lack of underwater protection and limited pumping meant single catastrophic hits could sink her.

WWII submarines relied heavily on pumps - USS Grouper survived depth charging that flooded multiple compartments through aggressive pumping and damage control. HMS Ark Royal (1941) sank not from torpedo damage itself but from progressive flooding as pumps failed to keep up with water ingress through damaged piping.

Modern systems are extraordinarily sophisticated. USS Samuel B. Roberts (1988) hit an Iranian mine that blew a 25-foot hole in her hull. Aggressive pumping and counterflooding kept her afloat - testimony to effective DC systems and crew training.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential system for any combat vessel
- Test pumps regularly in peacetime
- Know your ship's pumping capacity vs. potential flooding
- Counterflood early if listing - waiting makes it harder
- Diesel backup pumps critical when power fails
- Seal damaged compartments before pumping (don't pump the ocean)
- Multiple small breaches manageable; massive damage may exceed capacity
- Train crew in pump operation and valve alignments
- Consider power load - running all pumps may overload electrical system
- Portable pumps for spaces fixed system can't reach
- Pumping creates noise - enemy submarines may detect
- Critical decisions: sometimes flooding magazines saves the ship
