# Manual Damage Control Station

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | DCM-001 |
| **Era** | All Eras |
| **Category** | Damage Control |
| **Weight** | 1,200 kg |

## Description

Basic damage control facility equipped with manual firefighting equipment, portable pumps, damage repair materials, and medical supplies. Damage control parties stage from this location with axes, hoses, wooden plugs, shoring timbers, and other traditional DC gear. While lacking automation, manual DC stations provide essential capability for any vessel to fight fires, control flooding, and restore damaged systems.

The station includes storage for firefighting foam, sand, CO2 extinguishers, emergency lighting, breathing apparatus, and communication equipment. Trained DC parties can respond to casualties throughout the ship, though effectiveness depends heavily on crew training and leadership.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Basic Repair Capability**: Enable damage repair (baseline speed)
- **Firefighting**: Manual fire suppression with hoses and extinguishers
- **Flooding Control**: Portable pumps and patching materials
- **Casualty Response**: Medical aid and crew rescue
- **No Power Required**: Works even with power loss

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Repair Speed | Baseline (1.0x) |
| Firefighting Time | 60-120 seconds per fire |
| Pumping Rate | 50 gallons/minute (portable pumps) |
| Crew Efficiency | Dependent on training |
| Response Time | 30-60 seconds |
| Reliability | 92% (equipment dependent) |
| Power | None required |
| Equipment | Hoses, axes, pumps, shoring, extinguishers |

## Advantages

- No power requirements (always operational)
- Works in all eras
- Inexpensive and simple
- Crew-powered (no mechanical failures)
- Flexible response to various casualties
- Essential baseline capability
- Can be supplemented with additional stations
- Proven over centuries of naval warfare

## Disadvantages

- Slow compared to automated systems
- Labor intensive
- Effectiveness depends heavily on crew quality
- Requires significant crew allocation
- Manual pumping exhausting for crew
- Limited to one casualty at a time per team
- No centralized damage information
- Crew must physically reach damage location
- Smoke and heat limit effectiveness

## Historical Notes

Manual damage control is as old as seafaring itself. Wooden ship crews fought fires with bucket brigades and pumps. HMS Victory at Trafalgar (1805) survived partially due to well-trained DC parties. The transition to steel ships introduced new challenges - fires burned hotter, and flooding spread through damaged compartments more rapidly.

WWII proved the critical nature of damage control. USS Yorktown survived multiple hits at Coral Sea and Midway through exceptional DC work. Conversely, many ships were lost not from initial damage but from inadequate damage control - fires spread, flooding went uncontrolled, or crew abandoned ship prematurely.

The Royal Navy emphasized DC training extensively. British ships at Jutland (1916) generally controlled damage better than German vessels. Modern navies still train manual DC extensively as backup for automated systems.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential on all ships - this is your baseline capability
- Crew training dramatically affects effectiveness
- Pre-position DC equipment at key locations
- Establish repair party ready positions
- Practice DC drills regularly
- Designate repair party leaders
- Multiple DC stations allow parallel casualty response
- Manual DC works when power fails
- Crew fatigue becomes factor in extended firefighting
- Consider upgrading to automated systems when available
- Essential training: damage assessment, fire triangle, shoring techniques
