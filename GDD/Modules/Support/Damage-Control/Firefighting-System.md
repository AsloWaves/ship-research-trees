# Automated Firefighting System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | DC-004 |
| **Era** | 1940-Present |
| **Category** | Damage Control |
| **Weight** | 5,000 kg |
| **Crew Required** | 2 (system operators) |

## Description

Comprehensive fire detection and suppression system with sensors, automated sprinklers, foam generators, and gaseous suppression systems throughout the ship. Detects fires in seconds and begins suppression automatically, dramatically reducing fire damage and casualties. Represents the difference between contained fires and catastrophic conflagrations.

## Effect on Gameplay

Fires are detected and suppressed within seconds of ignition rather than requiring crew response. Small fires are extinguished automatically before spreading. Large fires are contained and suppressed much faster, reducing damage to ship systems and structure. Crew casualties from fire are significantly reduced.

## Specifications

| Capability | Performance |
|------------|-------------|
| **Fire Detection Time** | 1-3 seconds |
| **Suppression Activation** | 3-5 seconds after detection |
| **Fire Containment** | 80% of fires contained to origin compartment |
| **Suppression Effectiveness** | +50% faster fire fighting |
| **Coverage** | Ship-wide (all compartments) |
| **Sensor Density** | Multiple per compartment |
| **System Types** | Water, foam, halon, CO2 |

## System Components

### Fire Detection
- **Heat detectors**: Temperature rise sensors
- **Smoke detectors**: Optical and ionization types
- **Flame detectors**: UV/IR flame sensors
- **Rate-of-rise detectors**: Rapid temperature increase
- **Manual pull stations**: Crew-activated alarms
- **Redundant sensors**: Multiple sensors per space

### Water Systems
- **Sprinkler network**: Automatic spray heads
- **Deluge systems**: Flooding water release
- **Fog nozzles**: Water mist suppression
- **Fire mains**: High-pressure water distribution
- **Fire pumps**: Automatic activation
- **Saltwater capability**: Emergency unlimited supply

### Foam Systems
- **AFFF systems**: Aqueous film-forming foam
- **High-expansion foam**: Volume displacement
- **Foam generators**: Automatic mixing
- **Application systems**: Spray and sprinkler
- **Concentrate storage**: Onboard supply
- **Hangar protection**: Aviation fuel fires

### Gaseous Suppression
- **Halon systems**: Fast-acting suppression (older)
- **CO2 systems**: Oxygen displacement
- **Clean agents**: Modern Halon alternatives
- **Total flooding**: Entire compartment filled
- **Local application**: Specific equipment protection
- **Machinery spaces**: Engine room protection

## Fire Types and Response

### Class A (Ordinary Combustibles)
- **Materials**: Wood, paper, fabric, etc.
- **Suppression**: Water sprinklers
- **Response Time**: 3-5 seconds
- **Effectiveness**: 95% containment

### Class B (Flammable Liquids)
- **Materials**: Fuel, oil, grease
- **Suppression**: Foam systems
- **Response Time**: 5-10 seconds
- **Effectiveness**: 85% containment

### Class C (Electrical)
- **Materials**: Energized electrical equipment
- **Suppression**: Gaseous agents (non-conductive)
- **Response Time**: 5-8 seconds
- **Effectiveness**: 90% suppression

### Class D (Metals)
- **Materials**: Magnesium, titanium (rare on ships)
- **Suppression**: Special dry powder
- **Response Time**: Manual crew response
- **Effectiveness**: 60% (difficult fires)

## Automated Response Sequence

When fire detected:
1. **Alarm**: Audio/visual alerts throughout ship
2. **Notification**: DC Center and bridge alerted
3. **System Selection**: Appropriate suppression type
4. **Isolation**: Ventilation shutdown, doors close
5. **Suppression**: Agent release (3-5 sec after detection)
6. **Monitoring**: Sensors track fire status
7. **Crew Response**: DC parties dispatched if needed
8. **Verification**: Human confirmation of extinguishment

## Advantages Over Manual Firefighting

### Speed
- **Automated**: 3-5 second response
- **Manual**: 2-5 minute response
- **Difference**: Fire may quadruple in size during delay

### Coverage
- Sensors in all compartments
- Even unmanned spaces protected
- 24/7 monitoring
- No human fatigue factor

### Effectiveness
- Immediate suppression prevents spread
- Appropriate agent for fire type
- Consistent application
- Reduces smoke damage

### Crew Safety
- Reduced exposure to fire
- Automated systems handle initial attack
- Crew responds to already-suppressed fires
- Lower casualty rates

## Tactical Value

### Combat Effectiveness
- Battle damage fires contained quickly
- Machinery spaces protected
- Weapons remain operational despite nearby fires
- Ship stays in fight longer

### Survivability
- Prevents catastrophic fires
- Reduces progressive damage
- Maintains watertight integrity (less structural damage)
- Enables continued operations

### Crew Preservation
- Fewer fire casualties
- Reduced smoke inhalation
- Less crew diverted to DC duties
- More crew available for fighting/operations

## Limitations

- Does not prevent fires, only suppresses them
- System can be damaged by battle damage
- Requires onboard agent supply (finite)
- Gaseous systems can asphyxiate crew (evacuation needed)
- May cause water damage to sensitive equipment
- Power loss disables some components
- Very large fires may overwhelm systems
- Maintenance intensive
- Expensive installation and upkeep

## Historical Notes

Automated fire suppression emerged slowly in naval service. Early systems were simple sprinklers in magazines and storerooms. WWII demonstrated the need for better fire protection - USS Franklin burned for hours, while prompt flooding of magazines saved USS Lexington at Coral Sea (though she was ultimately lost).

Post-WWII analysis led to comprehensive shipboard fire protection. The USN implemented sprinkler systems throughout ships, with automated detection and suppression in machinery spaces. The 1967 USS Forrestal fire (134 dead) spurred further improvements - modern carriers have sophisticated systems that can flood hangar bays with foam in seconds.

Halon systems became standard for machinery and electrical spaces in the 1960s-70s. The quick suppression without water damage made Halon ideal for protecting expensive equipment. Environmental concerns led to Halon alternatives in the 1990s, with various clean agents replacing it.

The 2012 HMS Astute fire demonstrated modern system effectiveness - automated suppression contained the fire to one compartment, preventing potential disaster. Modern systems integrate with damage control automation, providing seamless fire protection that has dramatically reduced fire casualties and losses compared to earlier eras.
