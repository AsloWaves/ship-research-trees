# Long-Base Rangefinder

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-003 |
| **Era** | 1915+ |
| **Category** | Detection-Visual |
| **Weight** | 4,500 kg |

## Description

Massive 10-15 meter stereoscopic rangefinder for capital ships. Unlike coincidence types, stereoscopic rangefinders present separate images to each eye, requiring operators with excellent depth perception. The greatly increased base length provides exceptional accuracy at extreme ranges. These enormous instruments were mounted in armored hoods atop battleship and cruiser director towers.

The Japanese Type 92 15-meter rangefinder on Yamato-class battleships represented the pinnacle of optical fire control. British stereoscopic rangefinders required special operator selection based on depth perception tests. German instruments used hybrid coincidence-stereoscopic principles for easier operation.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Range Display**: Shows target range with ±100 yard accuracy
- **Precision Ranging**: Essential for extreme-range gunnery
- **Fire Control Computer**: High-quality input for ballistic calculations
- **Extended Range**: Effective to 30km+ in good conditions

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base Length | 10-15 meters |
| Accuracy (ideal) | ±100 yards |
| Accuracy (20km) | ±150 yards |
| Accuracy (30km) | ±250 yards |
| Maximum Range | 35,000 m |
| Measurement Time | 5-8 seconds |
| Weather Penalty | +200 yards error (haze/rain) |
| Crew Quality Bonus | Elite crew: -50 yards error |
| Night Capability | Severely degraded (requires illumination) |

## Advantages

- Exceptional accuracy at long range
- Enables extreme-range gunnery (25km+)
- No power requirements
- Provides backup if fire-control radar fails
- Can range multiple targets simultaneously
- High-quality fire control data
- Armored mounting protects instrument

## Disadvantages

- Extremely heavy (affects ship top-weight)
- Expensive and complex
- Requires specially trained operators
- Degraded in poor visibility
- Vulnerable to blast damage from own guns
- Requires frequent calibration
- Stereoscopic types need operators with good depth perception
- Limited to capital ships and heavy cruisers

## Historical Notes

Long-base rangefinders defined battleship fire control from WWI through the 1940s. At Jutland (1916), HMS Barham scored hits at 23,000 yards using her 15-foot rangefinders. The Japanese Navy placed extraordinary emphasis on optical rangefinding, with Yamato's 15-meter instruments being the largest ever mounted.

During the Battle of the Denmark Strait (1941), HMS Hood's rangefinders provided accurate ranges on Bismarck, though tragically the ship was lost before effective fire could be brought to bear. At Surigao Strait (1944), American battleships used both radar and optical rangefinders in concert, with optical instruments providing backup and verification.

The instruments remained in service well into the 1960s as backup systems, though radar fire control had become primary by 1945.

## Tactical Tips

- Most effective at ranges beyond 15km where precision matters
- Cross-check with radar ranges when available
- Requires clear atmosphere - haze dramatically reduces effectiveness
- Station most experienced operators on these instruments
- Use multiple rangefinders and average readings
- Compensate for own ship's motion
- Critical for battleship vs battleship duels
- In poor visibility, radar becomes superior
- Keep instruments calibrated - even slight errors magnify at range
