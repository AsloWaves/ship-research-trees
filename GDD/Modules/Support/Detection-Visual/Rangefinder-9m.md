# 9m Optical Rangefinder

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-007 |
| **Era** | 1915+ |
| **Detection Range** | 25 km (day) |
| **Coverage** | 90° (directed) |

## Description
Long-baseline stereoscopic rangefinder designed for battleship main battery fire control. The 9-meter baseline provides exceptional accuracy at long range, enabling precise gunnery at the extreme distances typical of battleship engagements. Often mounted on director control towers or turret tops.

## Detection Performance
| Condition | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clear day | 25 km | Excellent optics |
| Hazy | 16 km | Still effective |
| Night (moonlit) | 3 km | Better than smaller units |
| Night (dark) | 1 km | Limited |
| Storm | 8 km | Protected installation helps |

## Rangefinding Performance
| Range | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 10 km | ±15m | Extremely accurate |
| 15 km | ±30m | Excellent |
| 20 km | ±50m | Very good |
| 25 km | ±60m | Maximum effective range |
| 30 km | ±150m | Marginal but usable |

## Effect on Fog of War
- Precision ranging for main battery
- Enables accurate long-range gunnery
- Can range targets at visual horizon
- Integrates with mechanical fire control
- Critical for battleship combat

## Advantages
- Excellent accuracy at all practical ranges
- Long baseline improves precision
- Stereoscopic principle (depth perception)
- Can range at extreme distances
- Multiple backup units common on BBs

## Disadvantages
- Very heavy (affects topweight)
- Requires specially trained operators
- Stereoscopic type needs depth-perception
- Long instrument vulnerable to damage
- Single target at a time
- Still weather dependent

## Historical Notes
The 9m rangefinder became standard on battleships from WWI onward. British battleships typically mounted 9m stereoscopic rangefinders in their director control towers and on turret tops. HMS Hood had a 9m rangefinder in her DCT. The Battle of Jutland (1916) demonstrated the value of long-baseline rangefinders - accurate ranging was often the difference between hitting and missing at 15-20 km combat ranges.
