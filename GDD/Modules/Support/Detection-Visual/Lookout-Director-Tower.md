# Director Tower Lookout

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-004 |
| **Era** | 1920+ |
| **Detection Range** | 20 km (day) |
| **Coverage** | 360° |

## Description
Enclosed armored observation and fire control station positioned high on the superstructure. Combines elevated positioning with weather protection and optical equipment. Integrates lookout duties with fire direction, providing both detection and tactical coordination. The pinnacle of visual detection systems.

## Detection Performance
| Condition | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clear day | 20 km | Excellent optics + height |
| Hazy | 14 km | Protected optics perform better |
| Night (moonlit) | 3 km | Heated glass prevents fogging |
| Night (dark) | 1.2 km | Good low-light optics |
| Storm | 10 km | Enclosed position maintains effectiveness |

## Effect on Fog of War
- Superior detection range and reliability
- All-weather capability
- Coordinates with fire control systems
- Can direct attention to specific sectors
- Protected optics maintain clarity

## Advantages
- Best visual detection available
- Weather protection for crew and optics
- Integrated with fire control
- Armor protection (splinter-proof)
- Stable observation platform
- Heated/climate controlled
- Excellent crew endurance

## Disadvantages
- Heavy weight high on ship
- Affects stability
- Expensive installation
- High crew requirement
- Still limited by horizon
- Radar eventually superior

## Historical Notes
Director towers evolved from simple fire control tops into sophisticated observation posts combining fire direction, visual detection, and tactical coordination. British battleships featured prominent director control towers (DCTs) from the 1920s onward. The King George V class had a distinctive director tower atop the bridge. American battleships used similar fire control stations in their imposing superstructures. These positions provided commanding views but added considerable topweight - a stability concern for designers.
