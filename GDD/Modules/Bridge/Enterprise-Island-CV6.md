# Enterprise Island (CV-6) (BRG-SP05)

## Overview

The Enterprise Island represents the command structure of USS Enterprise (CV-6)—the "Big E," most decorated ship in US Navy history and the most famous aircraft carrier of World War II. This compact island superstructure commanded the ship through more major actions than any other US carrier, from Pearl Harbor to the final Japanese surrender. The Enterprise Island evolved through the war, pioneering radar integration, fighter direction, and comprehensive air operations coordination that defined American carrier warfare.

## Historical Details

### The Island Through the War

**Original Design (1938):**
Enterprise's island was compact, emphasizing flight deck space. The structure housed:
- Captain's bridge and navigation
- Flight control operations
- Ship's funnel (smoke exhaust)
- Basic fire control
- Signal bridge

**Early War Modifications (1941-1942):**
Addition of CXAM radar (one of first US carriers so equipped) transformed the island into a sensor platform. Fighter direction center added, pioneering coordinated CAP operations.

**Post-Santa Cruz Refit (1942-1943):**
After surviving three bomb hits at Santa Cruz, Enterprise received major island modifications:
- Enhanced radar suite (SC, SG systems)
- Improved fighter direction center
- Better AA directors (Mark 37)
- Enhanced structural protection
- Improved communication systems

**Late-War Configuration (1944-1945):**
Enterprise's island became a model for carrier operations:
- Comprehensive radar coverage
- Advanced CIC integration
- Superior fighter direction
- Kamikaze defense coordination
- Strike coordination with multiple carrier task groups

### Fighter Direction Pioneer

Enterprise pioneered modern fighter direction:

**Innovation:**
- Radar tracking of friendly and enemy aircraft
- Voice direction of fighters to intercepts
- Combat air patrol coordination
- Search pattern management
- Strike group coordination

**Battle of Santa Cruz Example:**
Despite sustaining bomb damage, Enterprise's fighter directors continued coordinating CAP, shooting down multiple attacking aircraft. The island's damage control kept systems operational despite fires and casualties.

### Admiral Spruance's Flagship

During critical battles, Enterprise served as flagship:

**Battle of Midway (June 1942):**
Admiral Raymond Spruance commanded from Enterprise, his calm decisions from the flag bridge leading to decisive American victory.

**Philippine Sea (June 1944):**
Spruance again commanded from Enterprise, managing the complex task force operations that destroyed Japanese carrier aviation.

### Survival Through Hell

Enterprise's island commanded the ship through incredible damage:

**Battle of the Eastern Solomons (August 24, 1942):**
Three bomb hits, significant damage, 74 killed. Island remained operational, Enterprise repaired and returned to action.

**Battle of Santa Cruz (October 26, 1942):**
Two direct bomb hits, near misses, 44 killed. Forward elevator destroyed, fires throughout ship. Island continued directing flight operations. Enterprise was last operational US carrier in Pacific for crucial weeks.

**Kamikaze Attack (May 14, 1945):**
Kamikaze crashed into forward elevator. 13 killed, significant damage. Island coordinated damage control, ship operational after temporary repairs.

### "The Grey Ghost"

Japanese propaganda repeatedly claimed Enterprise sunk. Radio Tokyo announced her destruction so many times that crew adopted the nickname "The Grey Ghost." The island's survival through multiple "sinkings" became legendary—Enterprise kept returning when enemy believed her destroyed.

## Technical Notes

### Island Design Philosophy

Carrier islands balanced competing requirements:

**Minimization:**
Small island maximized flight deck space for aircraft operations.

**Functionality:**
Housed all ship control, flight operations, and sensor systems.

**Visibility:**
Provided excellent sightlines for navigation and flight operations.

**Protection vs. Weight:**
Limited armor to control top weight, relying on redundancy and damage control.

### Radar Integration

Enterprise was among first carriers with integrated radar:

**CXAM (1941):**
Early air search radar, provided warning of Japanese attack aircraft.

**SC/SG (1943+):**
Advanced air search and surface search systems, dramatically improved detection capability.

**Fire Control Radars (1943+):**
Mark 37 directors with radar, enhanced AA capability against kamikazes.

### Combat Information Center

Enterprise's CIC became model for carrier operations:

**Functions:**
- Radar display and tracking
- Fighter direction coordination
- Strike planning and coordination
- Ship defense coordination
- Intelligence analysis
- Communication hub

**Innovation:**
Enterprise's CIC innovations were studied and replicated across the carrier fleet.

## Balance Considerations

### Design Intent

This premium/unique module represents:
- Premier US carrier operations
- Fighter direction excellence
- Legendary resilience
- Historical significance
- Most decorated ship

### Counterplay

Opponents facing Enterprise Island should:
- Target the island to disable flight operations
- Use heavy dive bombing against the structure
- Attempt to disable radar and communications
- Coordinate multiple strikes to overwhelm defenses
- Historical note: Japanese never successfully sank Enterprise despite trying repeatedly

## Lore Integration

The Enterprise Island commanded the most famous carrier of World War II through battles that shaped history. From this compact superstructure, officers directed operations that sank more enemy tonnage than any other US ship, pioneered carrier tactics that dominated the Pacific, and survived damage that would have sunk lesser vessels.

"The island was our castle," recalled a fighter director officer. "Small, cramped, but it was the brain of the ship. From there, we tracked enemy aircraft, directed our fighters, coordinated strikes, and fought the ship through hell itself. When bombs hit and fires raged, the island kept working. That was Enterprise—no matter what they threw at us, we kept fighting."

Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, who commanded from Enterprise's flag bridge, said: "I'll match the Big E against anything afloat. Her crew, her air group, and her spirit are unmatched."

The island survived three major bomb hits, multiple near-misses, kamikaze attacks, and typhoons. When other carriers sank, Enterprise returned to action. When the war ended, Enterprise steamed into Tokyo Bay—battered, patched, worn, but victorious.

The greatest tragedy came in peace: despite public campaigns to preserve her as a museum, Enterprise was scrapped in 1960. Only her bell and artifacts remain. But the legend of the Big E and her indomitable island lives on—the command post of the most decorated ship in US Navy history, the carrier that refused to die.

*"Enterprise was hurt, really hurt. Fires were raging, men were down, the forward elevator was wrecked. But the island kept working. Flight operations continued. We recovered aircraft, launched strikes, directed fighters. That was Enterprise—no matter how badly hurt, she kept fighting. From that island, we won the war."*
— Commander Richard Best, dive bomber pilot, Battle of Midway, scored hits on two Japanese carriers from Enterprise air group
