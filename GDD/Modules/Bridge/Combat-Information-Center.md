## The "Full Picture"

The CIC represents the transition to modern naval warfare. For the first time, a captain can "see" beyond the horizon, through fog, and at night. The tactical advantage is enormous.

## Historical Notes

The CIC concept was developed by the US Navy in 1942 after lessons learned at Coral Sea and Midway. The British equivalent was the "Operations Room." This centralized approach to combat information processing remains the standard today.
