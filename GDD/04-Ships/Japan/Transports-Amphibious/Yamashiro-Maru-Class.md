**High-Speed Assault Transports** - Yamashiro Maru-class were fast transports converted from passenger liners 1943-1944. 4 ships. 8,600 tons full load. 22 knots - unusually fast for transports. Carried 800-1,000 troops + 8-10 Daihatsu landing craft. Enabled rapid reinforcement operations. All lost 1944-1945.

**Key Specs:** 6,500/8,600 tons | 440ft | 22 kn | 8-10 landing craft | 800-1,000 troops | 1,500t cargo

**Concept:** Developed 1942-1943 as Japan shifted to defensive operations across Pacific. High-speed transports (APD-type) needed to rapidly reinforce threatened garrisons before Allied forces could establish beachheads. Concept borrowed from US Navy's APD conversions of flush-deck destroyers and destroyer escorts. Japanese version converted fast passenger liners rather than warships, prioritizing cargo/troop capacity over pure speed. Speed of 21-22 knots allowed movement under cover of darkness, arriving at destination by dawn to unload and depart before daylight air attacks.

**Ships:**
- **Yamashiro Maru** - 7,089 GRT passenger liner built 1930. Requisitioned August 1943, converted August-October 1943. Could carry 1,000 troops. Torpedoed and sunk by USS Sawfish (SS-276) on 23 January 1944 northwest of Palau (8°34'N, 133°48'E) during transport mission. 1,700+ casualties.

- **Kinryu Maru** - 6,862 GRT passenger/cargo liner built 1938. Requisitioned January 1943, converted February-April 1943. Carried 900 troops typically. Torpedoed by USS Pargo (SS-264) on 30 May 1944 off Saipan while transporting reinforcements (16°14'N, 146°16'E). Severe casualties among embarked troops.

- **Taiyo Maru No. 2** - 6,995 GRT liner built 1937. Requisitioned June 1943, converted July-September 1943. Capacity 850 troops. Bombed and sunk by USAAF B-24 Liberators on 12 November 1944 in Manila Bay while evacuating personnel from Philippines. Heavy casualties.

- **Azuma Maru** - 7,385 GRT liner built 1935. Requisitioned December 1943, converted January-March 1944. Last of class converted. Torpedoed by USS Kingfish (SS-234) on 28 October 1944 in South China Sea (20°30'N, 118°12'E) during convoy escort mission. Sank quickly with heavy loss of life.

**Conversion Details:** Modifications included removing luxury passenger fittings and installing military berthing (troop bunks in holds and former cabins). Reinforced deck areas for landing craft storage. Heavy-lift booms and davits for landing craft deployment. Enhanced communications equipment. Defensive armament installed: 4× 75mm Type 88 AA guns, 12× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (triple and single mounts). Depth charge racks and throwers (36 charges) for anti-submarine defense. Fresh water capacity increased. Medical facilities expanded - sick bay with 50-bed capacity.

**Landing Craft:** Carried 8-10 Daihatsu-class landing craft (14-meter type), fewer than larger Akitsu Maru-class but adequate for high-speed assault missions. Landing craft stored on deck secured to reinforced cradles. Deployment via heavy booms and davits - launched when ship stopped or slowed to minimal speed. Time to launch all craft approximately 45-60 minutes. Each Daihatsu could transport 70 troops or 10 tons cargo. Total lift capacity approximately 600-700 troops per wave, requiring 1-2 runs to fully disembark 1,000-man transport load.

**Troop Capacity:** Designed for 800-1,000 assault troops plus crew of 200. Accommodations austere - tiered bunks in holds, minimal comfort. Fresh water rationed. Galley could provide two hot meals per day during typical 1-3 day voyage. Medical staff included doctors and corpsmen for treating combat casualties during extraction missions. Ships sometimes overloaded to 1,200+ troops in emergency evacuations, resulting in severe overcrowding and reduced seaworthiness.

**Cargo Capability:** In addition to troops, could carry 1,000-1,500 tons military cargo: ammunition, fuel drums, weapons, equipment, supplies. Cargo holds could accommodate vehicles (trucks, light tanks) though this reduced troop capacity. Some missions configured as pure cargo runs with minimal troop load. Cargo handling equipment adequate but not specialized - loading/unloading slow compared to purpose-built cargo vessels.

**Speed and Operations:** Maximum speed 22 knots (sustained 21 knots) made them among fastest Japanese transports. Typical operational profile:
- Depart base late afternoon
- High-speed transit overnight (20-21 knots)
- Arrive destination dawn
- Rapid unloading (3-4 hours)
- Depart before noon to minimize air attack exposure
- Return transit at high speed

Strategy only viable early in war. By mid-1944, American submarines and aircraft coverage made even high-speed night runs extremely hazardous. All four ships sunk while attempting rapid reinforcement missions.

**Armament and Defense:** Defensive armament substantial for transports: 4× 75mm Type 88 AA guns provided long-range air defense; 12× 25mm Type 96 AA guns close-in defense. Fire control manual without radar in most cases. 36 depth charges with stern racks and K-gun throwers provided minimal anti-submarine defense - more deterrent than effective weapon. Ships lacked sonar and modern underwater detection - blind to submerged submarines. Some ships may have received degaussing equipment and Type 13 or Type 22 radar late in service.

**Operational History:** Class saw intensive service 1943-1944 in critical reinforcement operations:
- Central Pacific garrison reinforcement (Marianas, Carolines, Marshalls)
- Philippines troop movements
- New Guinea supply runs
- Evacuation missions from threatened positions

Ships operated primarily in "Tokyo Express" style high-speed runs. Losses mounted as American submarine and air coverage intensified. All four ships sunk within 11-month period (January-November 1944), representing 100% class loss rate - testimony to hazardous nature of high-speed transport operations in contested waters.

**Loss Analysis:** All four ships fell victim to American offensive operations:
- Two lost to submarine attack (Yamashiro Maru, Kinryu Maru) - demonstrated futility of surface speed against submerged submarines with acoustic torpedoes
- One lost to submarine (Azuma Maru) in convoy - even convoy protection insufficient
- One lost to air attack (Taiyo Maru No. 2) - high speed useless against aerial bombing

Casualties extremely heavy due to embarked troops - each sinking resulted in loss of 800-1,700+ personnel. Class losses contributed significantly to Japan's inability to reinforce threatened garrisons mid-war.

**Historical Significance:** Represented Japan's attempt to adapt fast passenger liner fleet to amphibious warfare requirements. Concept sound - high speed enabled tactical surprise and reduced exposure window. In practice, speed inadequate against American submarine force and air superiority. Complete loss of class by November 1944 symbolized collapse of Japan's ability to conduct effective reinforcement operations. Ships demonstrated that speed alone insufficient without air cover, effective anti-submarine measures, and secure sea lanes.
