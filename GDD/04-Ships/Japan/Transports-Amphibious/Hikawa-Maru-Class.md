**Elegant Liner Class** - Hikawa Maru-class were luxury passenger liners converted to hospital ships and transports during WWII. 3 ships (1930-1931). 11,622 GRT. Originally Seattle-Yokohama route. Hikawa Maru served entire war as hospital ship. Only one survived war - now museum ship in Yokohama.

**Key Specs:** 11,622 GRT | 535ft | 18.5 kn | 340 patients (hospital) or 2,000 troops (transport) | 2,500t cargo

**Pre-War Service:** Built 1929-1931 by Yokohama Dock Company for Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) trans-Pacific passenger service. Considered among finest Japanese liners of era - elegant Art Deco interiors, excellent cuisine, reliable service. Ships served Yokohama-Seattle route carrying passengers (238 first class, 96 tourist class) and cargo. Known for luxury appointments, smooth crossing, and professional Japanese hospitality. Ships represented Japan's maritime prestige during interwar period.

**Ships:**
- **Hikawa Maru** - Launched 30 September 1929, maiden voyage 13 May 1930. 11,622 GRT, 535 feet long. Famous as Japan's only surviving pre-war luxury liner. Survived war as hospital ship. Post-war repatriation service. Preserved as museum ship Yokohama since 1961.

- **Hie Maru** - Launched 1930, entered service 1930. Sister ship to Hikawa Maru. Converted to hospital ship 1941. Torpedoed and sunk by submarine USS Trigger (SS-237) on 11 November 1943 off Kyushu (32°N, 128°E) while transporting wounded from Rabaul. Approximately 200-300 casualties despite hospital ship markings.

- **Heian Maru** - Launched 1930, entered service 1931. Third sister ship. Requisitioned 1941, served as transport and hospital ship. Sunk by air attack 18 November 1943 at Kavieng, New Ireland, while serving as hospital ship. Heavy casualties among medical staff and patients.

**Hospital Ship Conversion:** All three ships requisitioned by Imperial Japanese Navy December 1941. Converted to hospital ships early 1942 according to Geneva Convention requirements:
- White hull with green horizontal stripe
- Large red crosses painted on hull sides and superstructure
- Red crosses painted on deck for aerial recognition
- Deck illuminated at night (required by Geneva Convention)
- All armament removed
- Passenger cabins converted to hospital wards
- Operating theaters installed (2 per ship)
- X-ray facilities, laboratories, pharmacy
- Capacity: 340 bed patients, 450 ambulatory/lightly wounded

Medical staff included doctors, surgeons, nurses, pharmacists, orderlies - approximately 80-100 medical personnel per ship. Ships assigned to evacuate wounded from forward areas (Rabaul, New Guinea, Philippines) to Japan for treatment.

**Hikawa Maru Service:** Only ship to survive war. Service record:
- 1930-1941: Trans-Pacific passenger service (30 round-trip voyages)
- 1941-1945: Hospital ship in Southwest Pacific
- Evacuated wounded from Rabaul, Philippines, New Guinea, Marianas
- Made multiple voyages between combat zones and Japan
- Protected by Geneva Convention but often suspected by Allies of carrying military cargo/personnel (violation of convention)
- Survived numerous submarine encounters - possibly spared due to hospital ship markings
- 1945-1953: Repatriation service bringing Japanese civilians/military home from overseas
- 1953-1960: Resumed limited passenger service
- 1961: Retired and preserved as museum ship

**Transport Configuration:** Ships sometimes operated as armed transports rather than hospital ships (removing Geneva protection). As transports:
- Capacity: 2,000 troops or 2,500 tons cargo
- Armament: 4× 75mm AA guns, 8× 25mm AA guns
- High speed (18 knots) valuable for rapid troop movements
- Large cargo holds suitable for military supplies, vehicles
- Hospital ship conversion reversible - could switch roles as needed

Dual-role operation controversial and possibly violated Geneva Convention. Allied forces suspected Japanese hospital ships of carrying munitions and troops, leading to some attacks on marked hospital ships.

**Loss of Hie Maru:** Torpedoed by USS Trigger 11 November 1943 off Kyushu despite hospital ship markings. Submarine commander Lt. Cdr. Roy Benson reported ship displayed red crosses but suspected carried cargo/troops in violation of Geneva Convention. Ship sank quickly. Approximately 200-300 casualties including wounded patients and medical staff. Controversy regarding legitimacy of attack - American analysis concluded ship may have been carrying military supplies in addition to wounded, justifying attack under rules of war.

**Loss of Heian Maru:** Sunk by American air attack 18 November 1943 at Kavieng anchorage. Aircraft from US carriers bombed Japanese shipping in harbor. Heian Maru marked as hospital ship but attacked anyway - possibly due to suspicion of Geneva Convention violations, or pilots unable to distinguish markings during attack. Ship burned and sank at dock. Heavy casualties among patients and medical personnel. Incident contributed to Japanese claims of American disregard for hospital ship protections.

**Post-War - Hikawa Maru:** After surrender, impressed for repatriation service 1945-1953. Made numerous voyages bringing Japanese nationals home from China, Korea, Southeast Asia, Pacific islands. Transported approximately 25,000 repatriates. Returned to NYK Line 1953, resumed limited passenger service. Age and outdated facilities made ship uneconomical. Retired 1960. Preserved as museum ship at Yamashita Park, Yokohama, 1961 - Japan's first museum ship. Restoration completed, opened to public. Remains popular tourist attraction - only surviving Japanese-built pre-war ocean liner.

**Museum Ship Status:** Hikawa Maru underwent major restoration 2006-2008, reopened April 2008. Preservation includes:
- First-class cabins and dining room restored to 1930s appearance
- Art Deco interiors carefully maintained
- Engine room accessible to visitors
- Hospital facilities from WWII service partially preserved
- Exhibits on ship's history and trans-Pacific passenger service
- Designated Important Cultural Property by Yokohama city

Ship represents tangible link to Japan's pre-war maritime heritage and WWII history. Only pre-war NYK luxury liner to survive.

**Historical Significance:** Class represented pinnacle of Japanese inter-war passenger liner design. Ships symbolized Japan's peaceful commercial expansion 1930s, then conversion to war service 1941. Hospital ship role controversial - Japanese maintained Geneva Convention compliance, Allies suspected violations. Loss of two ships to attack despite markings demonstrates ambiguities of hospital ship protection in total war. Hikawa Maru's survival and preservation provides rare glimpse into pre-war Japanese luxury liner era. Ship's museum status ensures historical legacy preserved for future generations.
