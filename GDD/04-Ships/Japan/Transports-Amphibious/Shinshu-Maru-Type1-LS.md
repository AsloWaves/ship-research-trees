**World's First Amphibious Assault Ship** - Shinshu Maru was world's first purpose-built amphibious assault ship (1935). 11,800 tons. Carried 29 Daihatsu landing craft + 2,200 troops. First floodable well deck (1936). Prototype for modern amphibious warfare.

**Key Specs:** 8,130/11,800 tons | 512ft | 19 kn | 29 landing craft | 2,200 troops | Well deck

**Innovation:** World's first purpose-built amphibious assault ship, designed and built in extreme secrecy by Imperial Japanese Army 1933-1935. Originally planned as seaplane carrier/tender with hangar for 20-26 small seaplanes and 2 aircraft catapults, but aircraft facilities removed before completion. Revolutionary floodable well deck added during June 1936 refit at Harima shipyard, with stern gate and side gates for rapid landing craft deployment. Prototype concept for modern Landing Ship Dock (LSD) and amphibious assault ship designs used by all navies today.

**Construction:** Built by Harima Shipbuilding Company, Aioi, Japan. Construction started April 1933, launched 14 March 1935, commissioned late 1934/early 1935. Operated under various cover names for secrecy: R1, GL, MT, Ryujo Maru, Fuso Maru. First practice landings with IJA 11th Division at Miyazaki and Shikoku coast (30 August - 8 September 1935).

**Service History:** Pre-war China operations (1935-1941). December 1941: Malayan Campaign, likely part of Singora Attack Force as "Ryujo Maru." February 1942: Participated in invasion of Java (Dutch East Indies Campaign). 27 February 1942: Hit by Japanese "Long Lance" torpedoes (friendly fire) during Battle of Sunda Strait, sank in shallow water in Bantam Bay, Java. Salvaged and refloated 23 September 1942, towed to Singapore (arrived 23 December 1942) for repairs, returned to service.

**Final Operations:** 1943-1945: Supply missions to Philippines. Final mission: Supply run to Leyte Island. 2 January 1945: Torpedoed and damaged by USS Aspro south of Formosa Strait. 3 January 1945: Heavily damaged by aircraft from US Task Force 38 while returning to Takao (Kaohsiung, Taiwan). Ship abandoned and sunk in Formosa Straits off Takao.

**Landing Craft:** Could carry 29× Daihatsu-class landing craft (14m, 10 tons capacity) OR 25× Shohatsu-class landing craft plus 4× AB-Tei-class armored gunboats. Landing craft deployed via floodable well deck - stern and side gates opened, well flooded, craft floated out. System allowed rapid deployment of entire assault wave simultaneously. Transported 2,200 assault troops plus landing craft crews.

**Armament:** As built (1935): 8× 75mm Type 88 anti-aircraft guns (later reduced to 4). Modified circa 1942: 4× 75mm Type 88 AA guns + 4× 20mm Type 98 AA guns. Lightly armed as operated primarily as logistics vessel behind invasion forces. Crew of 220 officers and men.

**Historical Significance:** Shinshu Maru pioneered amphibious assault ship concept 6 years before WWII. Design influenced Allied development of LSTs, LSDs, and modern amphibious warfare doctrine. Well deck concept now standard on all amphibious assault ships worldwide. Demonstrated feasibility of purpose-built amphibious operations rather than improvised conversions. Larger successors Akitsu Maru and Nigitsu Maru followed, but Shinshu Maru proved the concept.
