**Improved Japanese LST** - T.101-class were improved Landing Ship Tanks, built 1944-1945. 21 completed (31 planned). 1,450 tons full load. Slightly faster (11 knots) and better armed than T.1 class. Carried 6-8 tanks or 400 tons cargo. Bow ramp design.

**Key Specs:** 800/1,450 tons | 230ft | 11 kn | 6-8 tanks | 150 troops | 400t cargo | Bow ramp

**Design:** Refined version of T.1 class incorporating operational lessons and design simplifications for faster production. Slightly shorter (230 vs 250 feet) but with improved hull form for better seakeeping and speed. Enhanced subdivision with additional watertight compartments for improved survivability. Better ventilation in tank deck. Reinforced bow ramp structure after reports of damage in beaching operations. Improved bilge pumps and damage control equipment. Simplified superstructure to reduce construction time and labor requirements.

**Construction:** Built 1944-1945 across multiple Japanese shipyards as emergency wartime program. Hull numbers T.101-T.131 allocated (31 ships). Only 21 ships completed before war's end: T.101 through T.121. Ten ships (T.122-T.131) cancelled or scrapped incomplete on slips. Construction time 4-5 months per ship in established yards. Many completed ships lacked full equipment or armament due to material shortages. Some commissioned without radar or full fire control systems.

**Service History:** Like T.1 class, entered service too late for offensive amphibious operations. Most assigned to Combined Fleet reserve and homeland defense preparations. Several ships operational by March-April 1945, participated in:
- Emergency transport runs between Home Islands
- Evacuation missions from Korea and Manchuria (post-surrender)
- Supply missions to isolated garrisons
- Training exercises for Operation Ketsu-Go

Limited fuel availability severely restricted operations. Many ships never ventured beyond Inland Sea. Several damaged in harbor by American air raids. At least two lost to mines in approaches to Japanese ports.

**Landing Operations:** Bow ramp approximately 10 feet wide, lowered hydraulically (improved over T.1's manual system). Tank deck 160 feet long, 28 feet wide. Could accommodate 6-8 Type 97 medium tanks, 12-15 trucks, or 6 Type 89 medium tanks with equipment. Typical mixed load: 4 tanks, 4 trucks, 100 tons ammunition/supplies. Designed for beach gradient of 1:30 to 1:50. Draft of only 7 feet when light allowed operations in very shallow water. Could retract from beach under own power via twin screws and ballast adjustment.

**Capacity:** Maximum cargo 400 tons plus 150 troops (reduced from T.1 class to improve speed and range). Troops accommodated in two-tier bunks above tank deck, ventilated by forced-air system. Limited sanitary facilities - designed for short-haul transport (1-3 days). Fresh water capacity 10 days at reduced rations. Small galley could prepare only basic meals. Medical facilities minimal - one small sick bay.

**Armament:** Improved defensive armament: 1× 75mm Type 88 AA gun (forward or aft mount), 6× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (three twin mounts, port/starboard/stern), 4× 13mm Type 93 heavy machine guns (bridge wings). Added 6 depth charges with stern racks for minimal anti-submarine capability - more psychological deterrent than effective weapon system. Fire control entirely manual. Some late-production ships fitted with simple surface search radar (Type 22 or captured equipment).

**Propulsion:** Twin diesel engines, each 800 horsepower (total 1,600 shp) - increased from T.1 class. Twin screws with improved propeller design. Maximum speed 11 knots (10 knots sustained), though many ships hampered by poor fuel quality and maintenance issues. Range approximately 4,000 nautical miles at 9 knots - better than T.1 class. Fuel capacity 120 tons diesel oil. Electrical system upgraded with improved generators for damage control pumps and ventilation fans.

**Operational Record:** Most T.101-class ships saw minimal combat due to late commissioning. Known operations include:
- T.101, T.103, T.107: Supply runs to Kyushu (April-July 1945)
- T.105: Damaged by air attack in Kobe harbor (June 1945), repaired
- T.109, T.112: Participated in repatriation missions (September-October 1945)
- T.115: Lost to mine off Shimonoseki (July 1945)
- T.118: Bombed and sunk in Osaka Bay (August 1945)

Majority of class survived war intact but in poor mechanical condition due to maintenance neglect and fuel shortages.

**Post-War Service:** Most surviving ships (approximately 18-19) surrendered August 1945. Several impressed by Allied occupation forces for:
- Repatriation of Japanese military personnel and civilians from overseas
- Transport of supplies for occupation forces
- Minesweeping support operations
- Harbor clearance work

Used extensively in 1945-1946 repatriation effort, moving millions of Japanese from China, Korea, Southeast Asia back to Home Islands. Several ships transferred to Republic of China (Nationalist) forces 1946-1947. Remainder scrapped 1947-1949. None preserved.

**Historical Assessment:** Represented marginal improvement over T.1 class but still inferior to Allied LST designs in capacity, speed, and seaworthiness. Built too late and in insufficient numbers to affect war outcome. Demonstrated Japan's belated recognition of amphibious warfare importance but also exposed severe industrial limitations. Class more significant for post-war repatriation role than combat service.
