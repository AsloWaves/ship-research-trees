**Unique Amphibious Carriers** - Akitsu Maru-class were world's first ships combining landing craft deployment + organic aviation support. 2 ships (1942, 1943): Akitsu Maru (with flight deck), Nigitsu Maru. 11,800 tons. Carried 27 landing craft + 2,200 troops + 20 aircraft.

**Key Specs:** 11,800 tons | 499ft | 20 kn | 27 landing craft | 2,200 troops | 20 aircraft | 123m flight deck

**Innovation:** Revolutionary dual-purpose design - world's first vessels simultaneously carrying landing craft below AND aircraft on deck. Akitsu Maru featured 123m × 22.5m (404ft × 74ft) flight deck with no hangar, storing aircraft on main deck below. Could launch 20 land-based aircraft (Kokusai Ki-76 STOL observation aircraft, Kayaba Ka-1/Ka-2 autogyros) for combat air patrol, reconnaissance, and close air support during amphibious operations. Pioneered concept of providing aviation support for remote Pacific amphibious assaults without existing air bases. Operated by Imperial Japanese Army (not Navy) using IJA designation system.

**Ships:**
- **Akitsu Maru (IJA No. 999)** - Launched 24 Sept 1941, commissioned 30 Jan 1942. Originally passenger liner (9,186 BRT) requisitioned June 1941 from Nippon Kaiun K.K., converted by Harima Shipyard. Featured 123m flight deck, could carry 20 aircraft + 27 Daihatsu landing craft. July 1944: fitted with KX arresting gear to enable aircraft recovery.
- **Nigitsu Maru** - Laid down 10 March 1942, launched 28 Nov 1942, commissioned March 1943. Originally passenger liner (9,547 BRT) converted on the stocks. Most sources indicate NO flight deck - operated primarily as landing craft carrier.

**Service History:** Participated in numerous troop transport and amphibious operations throughout Pacific: New Guinea, Philippines, Southwest Pacific theater. Akitsu Maru used primarily as aircraft ferry rather than active combat carrier. 18 November 1943: Akitsu Maru torpedoed by USS Crevalle off Manila Bay entrance (survived, incorrectly reported sunk). Both ships served critical role transporting troops and providing landing craft deployment for island operations.

**Landing Craft Operations:** Stern doors and side davits enabled rapid deployment of 20-27 Daihatsu landing craft (14-meter class). Each Daihatsu could carry 70 troops or 1 light tank. Combined capacity: 2,200 soldiers plus landing craft crews. Landing craft launched via stern ramp and side davits, enabling entire assault wave deployment.

**Aviation:** Akitsu Maru's 123m flight deck installed at former boat deck level with small island structure and funnel shifted to starboard (funnel reportedly could turn horizontal during flight operations). Limited to small STOL aircraft (Ki-76) and autogyros (Ka-1/Ka-2) due to short deck and initially no arresting gear. Aircraft intended to fly off to coastal airfields after troops landed. July 1944: KX arresting gear fitted enabling aircraft recovery operations - revolutionary capability for amphibious assault ships.

**Armament:** As built (1942-1943): 10× 75mm/30 Type 38 guns (single mounts). After 1943 refit: 2× 75mm/44 Type 88 AA guns, 10× 75mm/30 Type 38 guns, 20× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (various single/twin/triple mounts). Defensive armament appropriate for logistics vessels operating behind invasion forces.

**Fate:**
- **Nigitsu Maru** - 12 January 1944: Torpedoed by USS Hake (SS-256) off Okino-Daito Island, southeast of Okinawa (23°15'N, 132°51'E). After day-long chase, two torpedo hits flooded engine room. Sank in eight minutes. 574 killed (456 soldiers, 83 gunners, 35 crew).
- **Akitsu Maru** - 15 November 1944: Torpedoed by USS Queenfish (SS-393) in Korean Strait (Tsushima Strait, 33°17'N, 128°11'E) while part of Convoy HI-81 transporting 23rd Infantry Division to Philippines. Four torpedoes fired, two hits. One detonated aft magazine containing depth charges, causing catastrophic explosion that shattered stern. Boilers exploded when seawater flooded engine room. 2,046 killed - mainly personnel from IJA 64th Infantry Regiment including regimental commander.
