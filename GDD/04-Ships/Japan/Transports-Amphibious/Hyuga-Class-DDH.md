**First Modern Carriers** - Hyuga-class are first Japanese through-deck aviation ships since WWII. 2 ships (2009, 2011): Hyuga, Ise. 19,000 tons. Carry 11 helicopters (18 max). Advanced ASW with 50m OQQ-21 sonar + AESA radar.

**Key Specs:** 13,950/19,000 tons | 646ft | 30 kn | 11 helicopters | 16 VLS | AESA radar | 50m sonar

**Innovation:** Revolutionary design marking Japan's return to large aviation platforms after 60+ years. Full-length through-deck with 4 simultaneous helicopter landing spots maximizes ASW operations efficiency. First JMSDF installation of FCS-3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar system. Massive 50-meter OQQ-21 bow-mounted sonar with multi-static capability (from 2015) provides exceptional submarine detection. Named after WWII battleship-carriers Hyuga and Ise (converted 1943).

**Ships:**
- **JS Hyuga (DDH-181)** - Launched 23 Aug 2007, commissioned 18 March 2009, homeport Maizuru
- **JS Ise (DDH-182)** - Launched 21 Aug 2009, commissioned 16 March 2011, homeport Sasebo

**Major Operations:** 2011 Tohoku earthquake/tsunami disaster relief (delivered supplies, search and rescue off Miyagi Prefecture). June 2013: First Japanese vessel to host US MV-22 Osprey landing (Exercise Dawn Blitz, San Diego). April 2016: Kumamoto earthquake relief - served as helicopter operations platform with US Marine Ospreys conducting supply missions. June 2017: Joint operations with USS Carl Vinson and USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike groups off Korean Peninsula (North Korea tensions). October 2021: JS Ise exercised with HMS Queen Elizabeth, USS Ronald Reagan, USS Carl Vinson. Regular RIMPAC and MALABAR exercise participation.

**Aviation:** Standard air wing: 3× Mitsubishi SH-60K Seahawk ASW helicopters, 1× AgustaWestland MCH-101 mine countermeasures/SAR helicopter. Can accommodate up to 11 helicopters in hangar configuration or 18 maximum with deck parking. Full-length flight deck with internal hangar provides all-weather operations. Demonstrated compatibility with US MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.

**Armament:** 16-cell Mk 41 VLS forward carries 16× RIM-162 ESSM (quad-packed, air defense) + 12× RUM-139 VL-ASROC (anti-submarine rockets). 2× Phalanx CIWS Mk 15 Block 1B (20mm, 3,000-4,500 rpm). 2× Type 68 triple torpedo tubes with Type 73 or Mk 46 Mod 5 lightweight torpedoes. Defensive armament appropriate for flagship/ASW carrier role.

**Sensors:** FCS-3 Multi-Function AESA radar can track multiple air and surface targets simultaneously with electronically steered beam. OPS-50 3D AESA air search radar (C-band, 203.7 km range). OQQ-21 integrated bow sonar (50m length, largest JMSDF sonar) with multi-static capability enables cooperative engagement. OPS-28D surface search radar. NOLQ-3C electronic warfare system. OYQ-10 Advanced Combat Direction System with ATECS integration provides fleet-wide coordination.

**Design:** Through-deck eliminates superstructure obstacles to flight operations. Island superstructure starboard side. Internal hangar protects aircraft in severe weather. Enhanced flagship capabilities with extensive command and control facilities. Can function as ASW carrier, fleet flagship, disaster relief platform, or amphibious support ship. Extensive medical facilities support humanitarian missions.
