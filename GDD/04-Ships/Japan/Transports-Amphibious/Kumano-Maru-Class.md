**Emergency Amphibious Conversions** - Kumano Maru-class were large landing craft carriers converted from passenger liners in final year of war. 2 ships (1945). 10,500 tons. Carried 36-40 Daihatsu landing craft + 1,500 troops. Planned flight deck capability. Emergency conversions for homeland defense.

**Key Specs:** 8,500/10,500 tons | 475ft | 21 kn | 36-40 landing craft | 1,500 troops | 10 aircraft

**Origins:** Emergency conversion program initiated early 1945 as Japan prepared for Operation Ketsu-Go (homeland defense against Allied invasion). Imperial Japanese Army requisitioned large passenger liners for rapid conversion to landing craft carriers, following success of earlier Akitsu Maru conversions. Program intended to provide mobile amphibious lift for counter-landing operations and coastal defense reinforcement. Design incorporated lessons from earlier conversions: emphasis on landing craft capacity, speed, and defensive armament.

**Ships:**
- **Kumano Maru** - Originally German liner SS Scharnhorst (18,184 GRT, built 1935), seized by Japan in 1942 while in Japanese port. Converted 1944-1945 at Mitsubishi Yokohama shipyard. Commissioned April 1945. Planned for flight deck but completed without due to time constraints. Carried 40 Daihatsu landing craft in holds and on deck. Heavily armed for self-defense. Speed 21 knots made her valuable for rapid reaction forces.

- **Kumano Maru II** - Converted from requisitioned Japanese passenger liner (approximately 10,000 GRT). Converted late 1944-early 1945. Less extensively modified than sister ship. No flight deck. Completed March 1945 with capacity for 36 Daihatsu landing craft. Slightly slower than lead ship.

**Design Features:** Conversion involved removing passenger accommodations and installing reinforced cargo holds for landing craft storage. Strengthened deck supports for landing craft secured topside. Heavy-duty cranes and davits for launching landing craft. Bow and stern ramps considered but not installed due to time constraints - craft launched by crane and davit only. Troop accommodations in former passenger cabins and hastily installed berthing spaces. Bridge upgraded with military communications equipment.

**Landing Craft Operations:** Could carry 36-40 Daihatsu-class landing craft (14-meter type) in holds and secured on deck. Launching sequence: cranes lifted craft from holds to deck level, then lowered by davits to water. Time-consuming process compared to modern well-deck designs - full deployment required 2-3 hours in calm seas. Could not conduct underway launch - required ship to stop or proceed at minimal speed. Each Daihatsu could carry 70 troops or 10 tons cargo. Total transport capacity approximately 1,500 soldiers plus crew.

**Aviation Plans:** Original conversion plans called for flight deck similar to Akitsu Maru - approximately 100-meter deck for launching light observation aircraft (Ki-76, Ka-2 autogyros). Would have combined landing craft carrier and escort carrier roles. Flight deck abandoned in final design due to:
- Insufficient time for structural modifications
- Material shortages (steel for flight deck support)
- Priority shift to maximizing landing craft capacity
- Lack of trained Army aviation pilots

Some sources indicate flight deck components fabricated but never installed. Ships might have received flight decks in post-war refit if Japan had not surrendered.

**Armament:** Heavy defensive armament for large auxiliary: 8× 75mm Type 88 AA guns (twin mounts, port/starboard fore/aft positions), 30× 25mm Type 96 AA guns (various configurations: triple, twin, and single mounts). Fire control primitive - manual aiming and ranging. No radar initially, though Kumano Maru may have received Type 22 surface search radar. Depth charge racks (12 charges) for minimal anti-submarine capability. Armament made ships among most heavily-armed Japanese transports.

**Service History:** Both ships completed too late for offensive operations. Assigned to homeland defense preparations:
- Inter-island transport missions in Inland Sea
- Pre-positioning landing craft for counter-invasion operations
- Troop transport between Honshu and Kyushu
- Training exercises for amphibious counter-attack forces

Fuel shortages severely limited operations. Most time spent at anchor as floating landing craft depots. American air supremacy made daylight movement suicidal - limited to night runs in coastal waters.

**Operational Limitations:** Ships suffered numerous deficiencies due to hasty conversion:
- Inadequate fresh water capacity for troop transport
- Poor ventilation in converted holds
- Insufficient medical facilities
- Limited food storage and preparation
- Mechanical problems from deferred maintenance on aging liners
- Fuel quality issues affected engine reliability

Nevertheless, high speed (19-21 knots) made them valuable assets compared to slower converted merchantmen.

**Final Operations:**
- **Kumano Maru** - Survived war, surrendered at Yokohama August 1945. Used briefly for repatriation operations September-November 1945. Mechanical problems led to deactivation December 1945. Scrapped 1946-1947.

- **Kumano Maru II** - May have been damaged in harbor by B-29 raid (July 1945) but sources unclear. Surrendered at Kobe. Used for repatriation late 1945, then laid up. Scrapped 1947.

**Historical Significance:** Represented Japan's desperate late-war attempts to prepare for homeland defense. Ships demonstrated Japanese understanding of amphibious warfare importance but exposed critical resource shortages. Conversion program too little, too late - ships never used in intended counter-landing role. More significant as symbol of Japan's defensive posture in war's final months. Post-war repatriation service perhaps most valuable contribution.

**Comparison to Predecessors:** Larger than Akitsu Maru-class (10,500 vs 11,800 tons comparable) but carried more landing craft (36-40 vs 27) at expense of aircraft capability. Faster (21 vs 20 knots) due to more powerful original machinery. Better armed (heavy AA fit). Represented refinement of amphibious conversion concept but lacked revolutionary features of earlier ships.
