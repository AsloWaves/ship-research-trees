**Desperate Undersea Logistics** - I-361-class were purpose-built transport submarines designed to supply isolated Japanese garrisons. 12 completed (1944-1945). 1,779 tons submerged. 13 knots surfaced. Carried 110 tons cargo + 60-80 troops + 2 Daihatsu landing craft. Attempted to bypass American naval blockade. Most lost 1944-1945. Desperate measure for hopeless situation.

**Key Specs:** 1,440/1,779 tons | 239ft | 13.2 kn surface/6 kn submerged | 110t cargo | 60-80 troops | 2 landing craft

**Development:** Designed 1943 as emergency solution to catastrophic merchant shipping losses. By mid-1943, American submarine offensive had decimated Japanese merchant fleet. Isolated island garrisons (Truk, Rabaul, Marshall Islands, Marianas) facing starvation and ammunition shortages. Surface supply runs suicidal due to American air and naval superiority. Japanese Navy conceived transport submarine concept:
- Submarines could evade air/surface detection
- Deliver critical supplies to bypassed garrisons
- Transport small numbers of high-value personnel
- Evacuate specialists from doomed positions

I-361 class designed specifically for cargo/personnel transport, not combat. Represents desperation of Japanese strategic situation 1943-1944.

**Design Features:** Purpose-built transport configuration, not combat submarine conversion:
- **Large cargo hold**: 110 tons capacity in pressurized cargo spaces
- **Troop compartment**: Berthing for 60-80 soldiers/sailors (extremely cramped)
- **Daihatsu stowage**: 2× 14-meter Daihatsu landing craft stowed in watertight deck hangar
- **Surfaced speed**: 13 knots - relatively fast for submarines, enabling rapid surfaced runs
- **Range**: 5,000 nm surfaced at 12 knots - adequate for inter-island operations
- **Diving depth**: 100 meters operational - shallow compared to combat submarines (reflects cargo/transport priority)
- **Minimal armament**: 1× 76mm deck gun, 2× 25mm AA guns - self-defense only, no torpedo tubes initially

Hull form optimized for surface speed and cargo capacity rather than underwater performance. Poor submerged handling compared to combat submarines.

**Ships (Representative Examples):**
- **I-361** - Commissioned January 1944. Operated in Central Pacific supply missions. Sunk by destroyer escort USS Frazier (DE-1048) on 30 May 1944 off Saipan during supply run (depth charged). All 62 crew lost.

- **I-362** - Commissioned March 1944. Lost on first mission - disappeared July 1944, probably sunk by American aircraft or submarine off Marianas. 52 crew missing.

- **I-363** - Commissioned April 1944. Survived multiple missions to Truk and Rabaul 1944. Converted to Kaiten carrier late 1944. Sunk by destroyer escorts 4 February 1945 off Iwo Jima. 72 lost.

- **I-365** - Commissioned June 1944. Lost August 1944 - cause unknown (submarine, aircraft, or mine). 52 missing.

- **I-366** - Commissioned July 1944. Survived war. Surrendered August 1945. Scuttled by US Navy April 1946.

Approximately 10 of 12 completed boats lost during war - 83% loss rate.

**Cargo Operations:** Typical cargo loads for isolated garrisons:
- **Ammunition**: Artillery shells, small arms rounds, grenades - highest priority
- **Medical supplies**: Medicines, bandages, surgical instruments
- **Food**: Compact high-calorie rations, vitamin supplements
- **Replacement parts**: Radio equipment, weapons components, engine parts
- **Personnel**: Replacement specialists, medics, communications personnel, commanders
- **Mail**: Letters, newspapers, propaganda materials (morale purposes)

110-ton capacity severely limited - could carry only fraction of garrison needs. Single supply run might provide 1-2 weeks' ammunition for battalion. Nevertheless, critical for garrisons completely cut off from other supply.

**Landing Craft Operations:** Two Daihatsu landing craft (14-meter type) stowed in watertight deck hangar:
- Submarine surfaced offshore (typically at night)
- Hangar opened, landing craft deployed via crane
- Landing craft loaded with cargo from submarine holds
- Craft ran to beach, unloaded, returned to submarine
- Process repeated for multiple trips
- Landing craft re-stowed or abandoned depending on situation

System enabled supply delivery without submarine beaching (too dangerous for large submarine). However, operations required 3-4 hours - long exposure time for submarine. Preferred moonless nights for concealment.

**Troop Transport:** Could carry 60-80 troops in addition to crew:
- Troops housed in cargo holds and any available spaces
- Extremely cramped conditions - men hot-bunking (sharing bunks in shifts)
- Limited sanitation facilities
- Minimal fresh water
- No galley capacity for additional personnel - cold rations only
- Designed for short voyages (2-3 days maximum)

Conditions so harsh that longer voyages risked troops arriving in weakened, dehydrated condition. Some missions attempted with 100+ troops - extremely dangerous overcrowding.

**Kaiten Carrier Conversion:** Several boats converted late 1944 to carry Kaiten suicide torpedoes:
- I-363, I-365, I-367, others
- 2-4 Kaiten torpedoes carried in deck mounts
- Kaiten: manned suicide torpedo, 1,550 kg warhead
- Submarine transported Kaiten to target area, released for suicide attacks
- Conversion removed cargo capacity - prioritized special attack missions

Kaiten conversions reflected Japanese desperation late war - suicide weapons prioritized over cargo delivery. Several boats lost while carrying Kaiten before weapons could be employed.

**Operational Record:** Class saw limited success despite crews' courage:
- **Supply missions**: Delivered small quantities of supplies to Truk, Rabaul, Wake, Marianas, Philippines
- **Evacuation missions**: Retrieved high-value personnel (code specialists, intelligence officers) from doomed garrisons
- **Special operations**: Transported commandos and special forces personnel
- **Kaiten missions**: Several boats conducted Kaiten attacks (limited success)

American anti-submarine forces increasingly effective 1944-1945. Destroyer escorts, aircraft, submarine nets, and mines made submarine supply runs extremely hazardous. Many boats lost on first or second missions.

**Notable Missions:**
- **Truk supply runs**: Multiple boats attempted supply runs to bypassed Truk base 1944. Several lost, including I-361, I-362.
- **Rabaul evacuations**: Boats retrieved specialist personnel before Rabaul collapse.
- **Iwo Jima operations**: I-363, I-368 attempted supply/Kaiten missions to Iwo Jima defenders February-March 1945. Both lost.

**Loss Analysis:** Extremely high loss rate (83%) due to:
- **Anti-submarine warfare**: American destroyer escorts with sonar/depth charges hunted submarines aggressively
- **Air patrols**: PBY Catalinas, PB4Y Liberators detected surfaced submarines
- **Mine fields**: American mines around Japanese-held islands
- **Submarine patrols**: American submarines hunted Japanese submarines
- **Extended surface operations**: Landing craft deployment required hours surfaced - extremely vulnerable
- **Predictable routes**: American intelligence could predict supply runs to known isolated garrisons

Boats sacrificed for minimal strategic benefit - 110-ton cargo deliveries insufficient to sustain garrisons long-term.

**Crew Casualties:** Approximately 520-550 submariners killed in class losses (52-62 per boat × 10 boats lost). Submarine service already dangerous; transport submarine duty particularly hazardous due to:
- Less maneuverable boats (cargo design compromised performance)
- Extended surface exposure (loading/unloading operations)
- Operating in heavily-patrolled enemy waters
- Minimal armament (couldn't fight back effectively)

Crew morale reportedly low - sailors understood missions near-suicidal.

**Comparison to German Transport Submarines:** Similar concept to German Type XIV and Type VIIF supply submarines ("Milch Cows"):
- **German**: Supplied combat submarines with fuel, torpedoes, food
- **Japanese I-361**: Supplied isolated garrisons with ammunition, food, personnel
- **German**: Larger (1,900-2,100 tons)
- **Japanese**: Smaller (1,779 tons)
- **Both**: High loss rates (German Type XIV: 10/10 lost; Japanese I-361: 10/12 lost)

Both represented desperate logistics measures that ultimately failed.

**Historical Significance:** I-361 class symbolized Japan's hopeless strategic situation late war:
- Reduced to supplying garrisons by submarine - inherently inefficient
- Submarines more valuable for commerce raiding/combat patrols, but drafted for logistics
- Minimal cargo capacity (110 tons) insufficient for sustained garrison support
- High loss rates unsustainable
- Desperate measure that couldn't alter war's outcome

Class represented wasted resources - material and trained submariners consumed in futile supply efforts. Submarines should have been employed attacking American logistics, not conducting Japanese logistics. Strategic bankruptcy of concept evident in hindsight.

**Fate of Survivors:** Two boats survived war (I-366, I-373):
- I-366: Surrendered at Kure, scuttled by US Navy 1946
- I-373: Surrendered at Sasebo, scuttled by US Navy 1946

US Navy studied boats to understand Japanese submarine transport concepts. Concluded design inefficient - submarines ill-suited for logistics role except in very specialized circumstances.

**Legacy:** I-361 class forgotten footnote of Pacific submarine warfare. Overshadowed by more famous American submarines (Gato, Balao) and Japanese combat submarines (I-400 aircraft carriers, I-16 midget submarine carriers). Nevertheless, boats represented real Japanese tactical response to American blockade. Courage of crews noteworthy - sailing repeatedly into heavily-defended waters knowing odds of survival minimal. Futility of missions epitomized Japan's hopeless situation 1944-1945.
