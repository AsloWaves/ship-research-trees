**British-Built Destroyers** - Amatsukaze-class were very early Japanese destroyers built in Britain. 2 ships commissioned 1905. British Yarrow design, built UK yards. Tiny (381 tons), coal-fired reciprocating engines. 31 knots (fast for 1905). Russo-Japanese War era. One 3-inch gun + five 6-pounders + two 18-inch torpedoes. Both scrapped 1924-1928 (obsolete). Represented Japanese practice of buying foreign-built ships before domestic construction capability matured.

**Key Specs:** 381/450 tons | 226ft | 31 kn | 1× 76mm + 5× 57mm + 2× 450mm torpedoes | Coal reciprocating | 2 ships

**Innovation:** British-designed and built destroyers for Imperial Japanese Navy. Yarrow & Company design (famous British destroyer builder). Commissioned 1905 for Russo-Japanese War. Very small (381 tons). Coal-fired reciprocating engines. 31 knots (fast for era - equal to contemporary British destroyers). Mixed armament: one 3-inch gun, five 6-pounder guns, two 18-inch torpedoes. Built in UK because Japan lacked destroyer construction experience 1905. Technology transfer - Japan learned from British designs. Both scrapped 1924-1928 (20+ years service, obsolete). Last foreign-built Japanese destroyers - all later classes built domestically.

**Design:** Very small British destroyer design (Yarrow type). One 3-inch gun forward. Five 6-pounder (57mm) guns distributed. Two single 18-inch torpedo tubes. Coal-fired reciprocating engines (British pattern). Two shafts. 31 knots (very fast for 1905). Limited range (1,600 nm - coastal). Unarmored. Crew 60. British construction standards - higher quality than early Japanese yards could achieve. Technology demonstration - showed Japan what modern destroyers should be.

**Ships (2 built - both scrapped):**

**Both British-built, both scrapped 1920s:**
1. **Amatsukaze** (Heavenly Wind) - Built Yarrow UK, commissioned 1905, scrapped 1924
2. **Tokitsukaze** (Time Wind) - Built Yarrow UK, commissioned 1905, scrapped 1928

**Construction:**

**Both ships:**
- **Builder:** Yarrow & Company, Scotstoun, Glasgow, UK
- **Laid down:** 1904
- **Launched:** 1904-1905
- **Commissioned:** 1905
- **Delivered:** Sailed from UK to Japan

**Service History:**

**Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905):**
- Commissioned near war's end
- Limited combat participation
- Training for Japanese crews
- Learned British destroyer tactics

**Post-War / Pre-WWI (1905-1914):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training platform (teaching Japanese crews British methods)
- Coastal patrol
- Technology demonstration

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Limited service (small, old)
- Coastal defense
- Harbor patrol
- Training duties

**Post-WWI (1919-1928):**
- Reserve fleet
- Completely obsolete
- **Amatsukaze scrapped 1924**
- **Tokitsukaze scrapped 1928**
- 20-23 years service (good for era)

**Why British-Built:**

**Japanese Situation (1904-1905):**
1. **War with Russia:** Urgent need for destroyers
2. **Domestic capacity:** Japanese yards inexperienced with destroyers
3. **Quality:** British destroyers world's best
4. **Speed:** British yards faster than Japanese
5. **Technology transfer:** Learn from British

**Result:**
- Ordered 2 destroyers from Yarrow (UK)
- High quality construction
- Fast delivery
- Training for Japanese crews
- Pattern for future domestic builds

**Yarrow & Company:**

**Famous British Builder:**
- Specialist destroyer builder
- Built destroyers for many navies
- High speed designs
- Quality construction
- **Japanese orders:**
  - Amatsukaze-class (2 ships, 1905)
  - Technology transferred to Japan
  - Helped Japan develop domestic destroyer industry

**British Influence on Japanese Destroyers:**

**Technology Transfer:**
1. **Design:** British destroyer layouts adopted
2. **Engineering:** British machinery patterns copied
3. **Tactics:** British destroyer tactics taught
4. **Standards:** British quality standards learned

**Result:**
- Later Japanese destroyers (Hatsu onwards) incorporated British lessons
- By 1910s: Japan building own destroyers domestically
- By 1920s: Japanese destroyer designs world-class (Fubuki revolutionary)
- **Foundation:** British-built Amatsukaze-class started learning process

**31 Knots in 1905:**

**Very Fast:**
- Contemporary battleships: 18 knots
- Contemporary cruisers: 20-23 knots
- **Amatsukaze: 31 knots** (revolutionary)

**Why So Fast:**
- Light hull (381 tons)
- Powerful engines (reciprocating but optimized)
- British engineering expertise
- Design priority: Speed to catch torpedo boats

**Mixed Armament Explained:**

**1× 3-inch (76mm) gun:**
- Forward mount
- Primary gun
- Anti-torpedo boat role

**5× 6-pounder (57mm) guns:**
- Quick-firing
- Anti-torpedo boat
- Distributed along hull

**Why Mixed:**
- 6-pounders faster firing
- 3-inch more powerful
- Combination gave flexibility
- Standard British practice 1905

**2× 18-inch torpedoes:**
- Single tube mounts
- Attack enemy fleet
- Fewer torpedoes than later destroyers (4-6 typical)

**Comparison - Early Destroyers:**
| Class | Ships | Built | Tons | Guns | Speed | Origin |
|-------|-------|-------|------|------|-------|--------|
| **Amatsukaze** | **2** | **UK** | **381** | **1× 3\" + 5× 6-pdr** | **31 kn** | **British** |
| Hatsu | 6 | Japan | 375 | 2× 3" | 29 kn | Japanese |
| Umikaze | 6 | Japan | 380 | 2× 3" | 33 kn | Japanese (turbines) |

**Amatsukaze: British-built, British design, high quality**

**Why Scrapped 1924-1928:**

**Same Issues as All Early Destroyers:**
1. **Age:** 20-23 years old
2. **Size:** 381 tons (tiny)
3. **Technology:** Coal, reciprocating engines
4. **Obsolete:** Modern destroyers 1,500-2,000 tons, oil, turbines
5. **No value:** Too small for any useful role

**Amatsukaze 1924, Tokitsukaze 1928:**
- Amatsukaze worse condition (scrapped earlier)
- Tokitsukaze lasted 4 more years (better condition or reserve)
- Both inevitable - completely obsolete

**Legacy:** Amatsukaze-class represented Japanese Navy's early practice of buying foreign-built warships. Two British-built Yarrow destroyers commissioned 1905 for Russo-Japanese War. High quality, 31 knots, British design/construction. Technology transfer - Japanese crews learned British destroyer operations. Foundation for domestic destroyer program - later classes (Hatsu onwards) incorporated British lessons. Both scrapped 1924-1928 (obsolete). Last foreign-built Japanese destroyers - all subsequent classes domestically built. Showed British influence on Japanese naval development. Names: Winds (Amatsukaze=Heavenly Wind, Tokitsukaze=Time Wind).

**Historical Significance:** Amatsukaze-class showed Japan's pragmatic approach to naval development. Needed destroyers for Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Japanese yards inexperienced, solution: buy British. Yarrow & Company built two high-quality destroyers. Japanese crews learned British methods, brought knowledge home. Foundation for Japanese destroyer program. By 1928 when Fubuki-class commissioned (revolutionary design, 1,980 tons, 38 knots, six 5-inch guns), Japan had evolved from buying 381-ton British boats to building world's best destroyers. Amatsukaze-class: humble beginning. Fubuki-class: world leadership. Evolution in 23 years. British influence visible throughout - layout, tactics, standards. But Japanese soon surpassed teachers. Amatsukaze forgotten, but started journey.
