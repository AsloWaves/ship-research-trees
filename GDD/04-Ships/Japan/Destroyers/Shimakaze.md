**Fastest Destroyer** - Shimakaze was experimental super destroyer - fastest destroyer ever built at 40.9 knots. Only ship completed of 16 planned. Fifteen 24-inch torpedoes (most ever on destroyer) in three quintuple launchers. Experimental high-pressure turbines. Commissioned May 1943. Sunk November 11, 1944 (Battle off Ormoc Bay). Legendary for extreme speed and torpedo power.

**Key Specs:** 2,567/3,048 tons | 416ft | 40.9 kn (fastest destroyer ever) | 6× 127mm + 15× 610mm Type 93 torpedoes | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Fastest destroyer ever built - achieved 40.9 knots on trials (designed for 40 knots). Experimental high-pressure steam turbines (79,240 shp vs ~52,000 normal). Fifteen 24-inch torpedoes - most torpedo tubes on any destroyer. Three quintuple launchers (unique - most destroyers had quad launchers). Designed to exploit speed and torpedoes against superior enemy forces. Only one completed due to complexity, cost, and wartime priorities. Represented peak destroyer performance before realities forced simpler designs.

**Design:** Three twin 5-inch turrets (two forward superfiring, one aft). **Three quintuple 24-inch torpedo launchers** - revolutionary armament (15 torpedoes total). Experimental high-pressure boilers and turbines for extreme speed. Larger displacement (2,567 tons) to accommodate powerful machinery. Heavy AA armament (28× 25mm). Rakish lines for speed. Advanced fire control. Designed as fleet destroyer for high-speed torpedo attacks.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Maizuru Naval Arsenal
- Laid down: August 8, 1941
- Launched: July 18, 1942
- Commissioned: May 10, 1943
- **Planned:** 16 ships of class
- **Completed:** Only 1 (Shimakaze)
- **Cancelled:** 15 ships (1942-1943)

**Why Only One Built:**
1. **Complexity:** High-pressure turbines difficult to manufacture
2. **Cost:** Far more expensive than standard destroyers
3. **Resources:** Steel, machinery needed for escorts and simpler ships
4. **Time:** Took longer to build than standard destroyers
5. **Priorities:** Convoy escorts more urgent than fleet destroyers
6. **War situation:** 1943 losses required quantity over quality

**Service (May 1943-November 1944):**
- **May-October 1943:** Training, shakedown, fleet exercises
- **November 1943:** Truk operations
- **January 1944:** Damaged by submarine USS Scamp (torpedo near-miss)
- **June 1944:** Battle of Philippine Sea - escorted Mobile Fleet
- **October 1944:** Battle of Leyte Gulf
- **November 11, 1944:** Battle off Ormoc Bay - sunk

**Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19-20, 1944):**
- Escorted Mobile Fleet carriers
- "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"
- Used high speed for screening operations
- Survived battle undamaged
- Speed advantage allowed evasive maneuvers

**Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 23-25, 1944):**
- Part of Admiral Shima's force (2nd Striking Force)
- Entered Surigao Strait after main force destroyed
- **October 25:** Encountered burning cruiser Mogami
- Withdrew after realizing main force defeated
- Speed allowed rapid withdrawal
- Survived battle

**Battle off Ormoc Bay (November 11, 1944):**
*Shimakaze's last battle*

**Background:**
- Mission: Transport reinforcements to Ormoc Bay, Leyte
- Convoy: Destroyers Shimakaze, Naganami, Wakatsuki, Hamanami, 5 transports
- US opposition: Carrier aircraft from Task Group 38.1

**November 11, 1944:**
- **Morning:** Convoy entered Ormoc Bay
- **8:45 AM:** Attacked by waves of US carrier aircraft (Hellcats, Helldivers, Avengers)
- Shimakaze used 40-knot speed for evasive maneuvers
- Successfully dodged many attacks
- **Hit by multiple bombs and rockets**
- Fires erupted, steering damaged
- Dead in water
- **Additional attacks** finished the ship
- **Capsized and sank**
- All 5 transports also sunk
- Entire convoy destroyed
- Exact casualties unknown (estimated 100-200 killed)

**Speed Records:**
- **Design speed:** 40 knots
- **Trial speed:** 40.9 knots (achieved on sea trials)
- **Sustained speed:** Could maintain 39+ knots for hours
- **Fastest destroyer ever built** (record still stands for non-nuclear)
- Faster than most light cruisers
- Could outrun almost any surface ship

**Experimental Turbines:**
- High-pressure geared steam turbines
- 79,240 shaft horsepower (50% more than Kagero)
- Advanced boiler design
- Complex machinery - maintenance intensive
- Fuel-hungry at high speed
- But achieved unprecedented performance

**Fifteen Torpedo Tubes:**
- **Three quintuple launchers** (5 tubes per mount)
- Unique in destroyer design
- Most torpedoes on any destroyer
- Type 93 Long Lance - 40,000 meter range
- Could fire devastating salvos
- But rarely got close enough to use them effectively

**Comparison - Super Destroyers:**
| Ship | Nation | Speed | Torpedoes | Displacement |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Shimakaze** | **Japan** | **40.9 kn** | **15× 24"** | **2,567** |
| Le Fantasque | France | 37 kn | 9× 21.7" | 2,569 |
| Tashkent | USSR | 39.5 kn | 6× 21" | 2,893 |
| Fletcher | USA | 36.5 kn | 10× 21" | 2,050 |

**Tactical Performance:**
- Speed allowed outrunning enemy forces
- Could choose engagement range
- Excellent for screening fast carriers
- Torpedo armament devastating in theory
- But air power made close-range torpedo attacks suicidal
- Speed couldn't save from aircraft

**Why Speed Didn't Save Shimakaze:**
- 40 knots impressive but aircraft flew 300+ knots
- Evasive maneuvers delayed hits but couldn't prevent them
- Eventually hit by concentrated attacks
- Speed useless against overwhelming air superiority
- Represented obsolescence of surface-centric destroyer design

**Legacy:** Shimakaze represented peak destroyer performance - fastest ever built (40.9 knots) with most torpedoes (15). But only one completed showed design's impracticality. Too expensive, complex, slow to build for wartime needs. Speed and torpedoes impressive but irrelevant against air power. Sunk by aircraft despite 40-knot speed - demonstrated that surface performance couldn't overcome air superiority. Legendary for extreme capabilities but tactical irrelevance. Symbol of IJN focusing on wrong capabilities. Name means "Island Wind."

**What If:**
- If all 16 built: Squadron of 40-knot destroyers with 240 torpedoes
- But would have consumed resources better spent on escorts
- Speed advantage negated by radar and aircraft
- Probably same fate as single ship - sunk by air attack
- Interesting experiment but wrong answer to WWII reality

**Comparison - Contemporary Destroyers:**
| Feature | Shimakaze | Yugumo-class | Fletcher (USA) |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Speed | 40.9 knots | 35 knots | 36.5 knots |
| Torpedoes | 15× 24" | 8× 24" | 10× 21" |
| SHP | 79,240 | 52,000 | 60,000 |
| Cost | High | Medium | Medium |
| Build time | 22 months | 18 months | 10-12 months |
| Number built | 1 | 19 | 175 |

**Historical Significance:** Shimakaze embodied "quality over quantity" philosophy - but WWII proved quantity won. Fastest destroyer ever but only one built. Fifteen torpedoes impressive but no opportunity to use them. Experimental turbines cutting-edge but maintenance nightmare. Speed advantage against surface ships but useless against aircraft. Sunk by bombs like every other destroyer. Represented peak of pre-war destroyer thinking applied to wartime reality - impressive but impractical. Contrast: US built 175 Fletchers while Japan built 1 Shimakaze. Numbers mattered more than 40 knots.

**Modern Popular Culture:**
- Featured in numerous books on IJN destroyers
- Popular in naval warfare games (World of Warships, etc.)
- Symbol of ultimate destroyer performance
- Legendary status among warship enthusiasts
- "Fastest destroyer" title ensures lasting fame
