**Fastest & Most Powerful** - Shimakaze was Japan's experimental super-destroyer. 1 ship commissioned May 1943. **40.9 knots** - fastest Japanese destroyer ever built! Most powerful destroyer armament: **15× 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes** (5 triple mounts - more than any destroyer in world!). 6× 5-inch guns (3 twin turrets). Experimental high-pressure boilers (79,240 shp - incredible power). 3 shafts (unusual). Only 1 built (16 planned, cancelled). Served 18 months. Lost: October 26, 1944, Battle of Leyte Gulf (carrier aircraft). Ultimate expression of Japanese destroyer design - speed, torpedoes, aggression. Legendary ship, famous in popular culture.

**Key Specs:** 2,567/3,048 tons | 421ft | **40.9 kn** | 6× 127mm + **15× 610mm torpedoes** | 1 ship lost

**Innovation:** **Ultimate Japanese destroyer** - pinnacle of IJN design philosophy. **40.9 knots** (40 trials, 40.9 max recorded - **fastest Japanese destroyer ever!**). Experimental high-pressure boilers: 79,240 shp (vs typical 52,000 shp destroyers - 50% more power!). Three shafts (unusual - most destroyers 2 shafts). **15× 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes** - five triple mounts (more torpedoes than ANY destroyer worldwide!). Type 93 Long Lance: 40,000-yard range, oxygen-fueled, 1,080-lb warhead (deadliest torpedoes). Six 127mm guns in three twin turrets (same as US Fletcher-class - good firepower). 28× 25mm AA guns (heavy AA for Japanese destroyer). Type 22 radar (surface search). Experimental ship - test advanced technologies. Plan: Build 16 ships if successful. Reality: Only 1 completed (war situation deteriorating, resources scarce). Shimakaze: Everything Japanese destroyers aspired to be - fast, heavily armed, aggressive.

**Design:** Large destroyer hull (421 ft, 3,048 tons full). Three twin 127mm turrets: 2 forward (superfiring), 1 aft. **FIVE triple 24-inch torpedo mounts** (unprecedented!): 3 centerline, 2 wing mounts (port/starboard between funnels). Total 15 torpedoes ready to fire - devastating broadside. Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes (40 km range, oxygen engine, wakeless, massive warhead). 28× 25mm AA guns (7 quad mounts - heavy AA battery). Experimental boilers: Six Kampon high-pressure boilers (79,240 shp total - enormous power for 3,000-ton ship!). Steam turbines driving three shafts (unusual configuration - typically 2 shafts). **40.9 knots maximum speed** (sea trials exceeded design speed!). Range 6,000 nm at 18 knots (excellent endurance). Crew 267 (larger than typical destroyer - 200-220). Type 22 radar on mainmast. Type 94 fire control. Distinctive profile: Two funnels, five torpedo mounts visible, sleek lines.

**Development:**

**Origin (1939-1940):**
- IJN wanted ultimate destroyer
- Specifications: 40+ knots, maximum torpedoes, heavy guns
- Experimental high-pressure boilers (key to speed)
- Plan: Build 16 ships (Shimakaze-class)

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Maizuru Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** August 8, 1941
- **Launched:** July 18, 1942
- **Commissioned:** May 10, 1943
- **Cost:** Very expensive (experimental technologies, high-pressure boilers)

**Why Only 1 Built:**
1. **Too expensive**: High-pressure boilers costly, complex
2. **Resource shortage**: By 1943, Japan desperate for materials
3. **Production priority**: Needed many standard destroyers, not few expensive ones
4. **War situation**: Losing war, can't afford experiments
5. **Maintenance concerns**: High-pressure boilers feared unreliable
6. **16 ships cancelled**: Only Shimakaze completed

**Service History:**

**May-December 1943 (Shakedown/Training):**
- Commissioned May 10, 1943
- Speed trials: **40.9 knots recorded!** (exceeded design 40 knots)
- Most powerful destroyer afloat
- Training operations
- Fleet integration

**January-September 1944 (Operational Service):**
- Escort operations (carriers, battleships)
- Manila-Lingga route (oil runs)
- Training exercises
- Limited frontline action (too valuable to risk early?)

**October 1944 - Battle of Leyte Gulf:**

**Largest Naval Battle in History:**
- **October 23-26, 1944**
- Multiple actions: Sibuyan Sea, Surigao Strait, Samar, Cape Engaño
- Shimakaze assigned to Admiral Kurita's Center Force

**October 24, 1944 (Sibuyan Sea):**
- Shimakaze with battleship Yamato's force
- US carrier aircraft attacked
- Shimakaze undamaged (avoided bombs/torpedoes)
- Battleship Musashi sunk this day

**October 25, 1944 (Battle off Samar):**
- Center Force encountered US escort carriers (Taffy 3)
- Shimakaze engaged in surface action
- Fired torpedoes at US carriers/escorts
- US aircraft counterattacked
- Shimakaze damaged but survived

**October 26, 1944 - SHIMAKAZE SUNK:**
- **Morning**: Withdrawing from Philippines
- **Location**: Ormoc Bay, Leyte
- **Attack**: Massive US carrier aircraft raid (hundreds of planes)
- **Shimakaze hit**: Multiple bombs and rockets
- **Fires**: Ammunition exploded
- **Sank rapidly**: 40.9-knot speed useless against aircraft
- **Casualties**: ~220 killed (most of 267 crew)
- **Survivors**: ~47 rescued

**Only 18 Months Service:**
- Commissioned: May 10, 1943
- Sunk: October 26, 1944
- Total service: 18 months
- Lost before reaching full potential

**40.9 Knots - Speed Record:**

**Fastest Japanese Destroyer Ever:**
- Design speed: 40 knots
- **Actual trials: 40.9 knots!** (exceeded specification)
- Previous Japanese record: 39 knots (Minekaze-class, 1920)
- Shimakaze held record for 23 years!

**How Achieved:**
- **Massive power**: 79,240 shp (vs 52,000 typical)
- **Three shafts**: Distribute power efficiently
- **High-pressure boilers**: Advanced technology, higher temperatures/pressures
- **Hydrodynamic hull**: Fine lines, low drag
- **Power-to-weight**: 79,240 shp / 3,048 tons = 26 shp/ton (vs 18-20 typical)

**Comparison - Destroyer Speeds:**
| Ship | Nation | Year | Speed | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| **Shimakaze** | **Japan** | **1943** | **40.9 kn** | **Fastest Japanese ever** |
| Minekaze | Japan | 1920 | 39 kn | Previous record |
| Le Fantasque | France | 1935 | 43 kn | Fastest ever (but light destroyer leaders) |
| Fletcher | USA | 1942 | 36.5 kn | Typical WWII |
| Tribal | UK | 1938 | 36 kn | Typical WWII |

**Shimakaze: Fastest fleet destroyer (Le Fantasque were destroyer leaders, different category)**

**15 Torpedoes - Most Powerful Armament:**

**Unprecedented Firepower:**
- **15× 610mm (24-inch) torpedo tubes**
- Five triple mounts (vs typical 2-3 triple mounts = 6-9 tubes)
- Type 93 Long Lance: Deadliest torpedoes in world
- **Broadside salvo: 15 Long Lances** (devastating!)

**Configuration:**
1. **Mount #1**: Triple, centerline forward
2. **Mount #2**: Triple, centerline between funnels
3. **Mount #3**: Triple, centerline aft
4. **Mount #4**: Triple, port wing (between funnels)
5. **Mount #5**: Triple, starboard wing (between funnels)

**Tactical Implications:**
- **Mass torpedo attack**: 15 Long Lances could saturate defenses
- **40 km range**: Launch from extreme range (beyond gun range)
- **Oxygen-fueled**: Wakeless, hard to detect
- **Any bearing**: Wing mounts allow torpedoes to any direction
- **Reload**: Ship carried reloads (total 24+ torpedoes aboard)

**Problem:**
- **Never fully utilized**: Lost before major night battle (where torpedoes excel)
- Leyte Gulf: Some torpedoes fired at Taffy 3, but mostly sunk by aircraft before torpedo attack
- **Speed + 15 torpedoes** designed for night destroyer attack - didn't get chance

**Why Only 1 Built - The 16-Ship Plan:**

**Original Plan (1940-1941):**
- Build 16 Shimakaze-class destroyers
- Form elite destroyer squadrons
- Ultimate destroyer force

**Cancellation Reasons:**

**1. Cost:**
- Shimakaze: ~¥12-15 million (1943 yen)
- Yugumo-class: ~¥8-9 million
- **Shimakaze 50-80% more expensive!**
- Could build 1.5-2 standard destroyers for same cost

**2. Complexity:**
- High-pressure boilers experimental, unproven
- Maintenance intensive
- Trained personnel needed
- Feared unreliability in combat

**3. War Situation (1942-1943):**
- Japan losing war (Midway, Guadalcanal defeats)
- Need many ships, not few expensive ones
- Resources (steel, copper, oil) desperately short
- Prioritize numbers over quality

**4. Strategic Shift:**
- 1941: Offensive war (attack enemy fleets - need fast torpedo ships)
- 1943: Defensive war (convoy escort, defend islands - need many ships)
- Shimakaze designed for offensive, but war now defensive

**Result:**
- 16 ships cancelled
- Only Shimakaze completed
- Resources diverted to:
  - Matsu/Tachibana simplified destroyers (mass production)
  - Submarines
  - Aircraft
  - Land defenses

**Popular Culture - Legendary Status:**

**Shimakaze Famous In:**

**1. Kantai Collection (KanColle):**
- Japanese browser game (2013+)
- Ships personified as girls ("shipgirls")
- Shimakaze: Extremely popular character
  - Rabbit-like accessories (speed reference - "fast like rabbit")
  - Hyperactive personality (reflects high speed)
  - Iconic design
- **Most recognizable Japanese destroyer** in modern culture

**2. Azur Lane:**
- Mobile game
- Shimakaze character popular
- Speed emphasized

**3. World of Warships:**
- Naval combat game
- Shimakaze: Tier X (highest) Japanese destroyer
- Fast, 15 torpedoes (longest range in game)
- Popular ship

**4. Anime:**
- Featured in various naval anime
- Represents IJN destroyer excellence

**Why Popular:**
- **Fastest** (40.9 knots - impressive!)
- **Most torpedoes** (15 - unique!)
- **Lost young** (18 months - tragedy)
- **Only one** (rarity, uniqueness)
- **Beautiful ship** (sleek, powerful-looking)
- **Might-have-been**: Imagine 16 Shimakaze in fleet!

**Comparison - Ultimate Destroyers:**

| Ship | Nation | Year | Tons | Speed | Guns | Torpedoes | Notes |
|------|--------|------|------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Shimakaze** | **Japan** | **1943** | **3,048** | **40.9 kn** | **6× 127mm** | **15× 610mm** | **Most torpedoes** |
| Fletcher | USA | 1942 | 2,500 | 36.5 kn | 5× 127mm | 10× 533mm | Mass produced (175+) |
| Gearing | USA | 1945 | 3,460 | 36.5 kn | 6× 127mm | 10× 533mm | Larger Fletcher |
| Z-52 | Germany | 1944 | 3,500 | 39 kn | 5× 150mm | 10× 533mm | Largest German |
| Tashkent | USSR | 1939 | 3,200 | 43 kn | 6× 130mm | 6× 533mm | Fastest (leader type) |

**Shimakaze: Most torpedoes, one of fastest, but only 1 built**

**Legacy:** Shimakaze was Japan's ultimate destroyer - pinnacle of IJN design philosophy. 40.9 knots (fastest Japanese destroyer ever, held record). 15× 24-inch Long Lance torpedoes (most powerful destroyer armament worldwide!). Experimental high-pressure boilers (79,240 shp - enormous power). Only 1 built (16 planned, cancelled - too expensive/complex, war deteriorating). Commissioned May 1943, lost October 1944 at Leyte Gulf (carrier aircraft). Served only 18 months - never reached full potential. Designed for aggressive night torpedo attacks, but era of aircraft dominance. Speed useless against dive bombers. Famous in modern popular culture (anime, games) - legendary status. Shimakaze: Might-have-been that represents IJN destroyer excellence at peak - and limits of that philosophy.

**Historical Significance:** Shimakaze epitomized Japanese destroyer philosophy: Speed, torpedoes, aggression. 40.9 knots - never surpassed by Japanese destroyer. 15 Long Lances - no destroyer before or since had more torpedoes. Shows Japanese commitment to quality over quantity (opposite US mass production). But only 1 built (vs 175 US Fletcher-class!) shows philosophy's flaw: Can't win war with expensive unique ships. Cancelled 16-ship program symbolic: 1941-1942 Japan (aggressive, offensive, build ultimate weapons) vs 1943-1945 Japan (defensive, desperate, mass produce simple ships). Shimakaze design perfect for 1920s-1930s naval thinking: Night fleet battles, torpedo attacks, decisive engagement. By 1943-1944: Aircraft ruled, radar detected attacks, no night battles. 40.9-knot speed useless at Leyte Gulf - dive bombers sank her anyway. Lost at 18 months (May 1943 - October 1944) - ultimate Japanese destroyer destroyed before proving itself. Modern popularity (games, anime) reflects "clean Wehrmacht/IJN" myth: Advanced technology, sleek ships, might-have-beens. Reality: One Shimakaze vs 175 Fletchers = Japan lost production war. But Shimakaze remains legendary - beautiful, fast, powerful, tragic. Symbol of IJN at its best and its hubris.
