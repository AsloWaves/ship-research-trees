**The Survivors** - Tachibana-class were improved emergency destroyers. 14 ships commissioned 1945. Slightly larger than Matsu-class (1,289 tons). Three 5-inch DP guns + 28 light AA + four torpedoes. **All 14 survived war intact** (100% survival rate - unique for IJN destroyer class). Most commissioned too late for combat (February-July 1945). Used for repatriation 1945-1947, then scrapped. Last destroyers built for Imperial Japanese Navy.

**Key Specs:** 1,289/1,560 tons | 328ft | 28 kn | 3× 127mm DP + 28× 25mm AA + 4× 610mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 14 ships

**Innovation:** Improved Matsu-class design. Slightly larger (1,289 vs 1,262 tons). Better habitability, improved AA layout. Same armament but better fire control. **100% survival rate unprecedented** - all 14 survived war. Commissioned too late for major combat (February-July 1945). Showed Matsu design refinements but war ended before impact. Last destroyers built for IJN. All used for repatriation duty 1945-1947. None preserved. Represented "too little, too late" - good design but post-war timing.

**Design:** Improved Matsu-class. Three single 5-inch DP guns (one forward, two aft). 28× 25mm AA guns (standardized fit). Four single torpedo tubes with reloads. 36 depth charges, 2 throwers. All-welded construction. Better crew accommodations than Matsu. Improved bridge layout. Similar machinery to Matsu. Slightly better seakeeping. Simple fire control. Radar (if available late war). Emphasis on AA and ASW, like Matsu.

**Construction:**

**Builders:** Multiple yards
- Fujinagata Shipyard
- Hakodate Dock Company
- Hitachi Shipbuilding
- Maizuru Naval Arsenal
- Sasebo Naval Arsenal
- Yokosuka Naval Arsenal

**Construction Speed:**
- Similar to Matsu: 6-8 months
- Commissioned February-August 1945
- Most completed just before/after surrender

**Service History:**

**Limited Wartime Service:**
Most Tachibana-class commissioned too late for significant combat:

**February 1945 - Tachibana, Nashi:**
- First two commissioned
- Brief patrol duties in home waters
- No major engagements
- War ending, fuel scarce

**March-July 1945 - Remaining 12:**
- Commissioned as war neared end
- Coastal patrol and defense
- Some air raid experiences
- Avoided major battles
- Limited fuel restricted operations

**Last Four (Shide, Wakazakura, etc.):**
- Commissioned days before/after surrender
- Essentially no wartime service
- Surrendered immediately upon commissioning

**Why 100% Survival:**

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Late commissioning:** February-August 1945 - only 0-6 months service
2. **Limited deployment:** Most stayed near Japan
3. **Fuel shortage:** Could not deploy far from bases
4. **War ending:** Surrender August 15, 1945
5. **Coastal operations:** Avoided major battles
6. **Good AA:** Heavy AA armament protected against air attacks
7. **Luck:** War ended before attrition took toll

**Context:** **Only IJN destroyer class with 0% combat losses**

**Post-War Service (1945-1947):**

**Repatriation Duty:**
- All 14 used for repatriation missions
- Transported Japanese personnel from:
  - Korea
  - Manchuria
  - China
  - Southeast Asia
  - Pacific islands
- 1945-1947 intensive operations
- Carried thousands of civilians and military

**Under Allied Control:**
- Operated under Allied supervision
- Marked with Japanese flag and Allied codes
- Unarmed (weapons removed)
- Focused on humanitarian missions

**Scrapping (1947-1948):**
- All 14 scrapped as war reparations
- Broken up in Japan
- None preserved
- Ended service after only 2-4 years total

**Comparison with Matsu-Class:**

| Feature | Matsu-Class | Tachibana-Class |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Displacement | 1,262 tons | 1,289 tons |
| Speed | 27.8 knots | 28 knots |
| Main guns | 3× 5" DP | 3× 5" DP |
| Light AA | 25-40× 25mm | 28× 25mm (standard) |
| Torpedoes | 4 tubes | 4 tubes |
| Commissioned | 1944-1945 | 1945 only |
| Combat losses | 9 of 18 (50%) | 0 of 14 (0%) |
| Survival | 9 survived | 14 survived |

**Improvements over Matsu:**
- Slightly larger, better seakeeping
- Standardized AA fit (28× 25mm)
- Better crew accommodations
- Improved fire control layout
- Lessons learned from Matsu service

**Historical Context:**

**By 1945:**
- Japan losing war rapidly
- Fuel shortages severe
- Air raids constant
- Most operations coastal defense
- Surrender imminent

**Tachibana-class represented:**
- Continued production despite inevitable defeat
- Good design but irrelevant timing
- Shipyard momentum (couldn't stop easily)
- Hope for miracle that never came

**127mm/50 Type 89 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Matsu-class and Akizuki-class
- **Caliber:** 127mm (5 inches)
- **Dual-purpose:** Anti-surface and anti-aircraft
- **Maximum range:** 18,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 10-15 rounds per minute
- **Fire control:** Simple director

**Comparison - Late-War Destroyers:**
| Class | Nation | Ships | Commissioned | Combat Losses | Survival Rate |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Tachibana** | **Japan** | **14** | **1945** | **0 (0%)** | **100%** |
| Matsu | Japan | 18 | 1944-45 | 9 (50%) | 50% |
| Fletcher | USA | 175 | 1942-44 | 19 (11%) | 89% |
| Gearing | USA | 98 | 1945-46 | 0 (0%) | 100% |

**Why Never in Combat:**

**Timing:**
- Commissioned February-August 1945
- War surrendered August 15, 1945
- Maximum 6 months service, minimum 10 days

**Fuel Crisis:**
- Japan's oil supplies exhausted
- Ships couldn't deploy far
- Training missions only
- Coastal patrols limited

**Strategic Situation:**
- US controlled seas completely
- Air raids destroyed ports
- No offensive operations possible
- Defensive posture only

**Result:** Ships complete, crews trained, but war over

**Repatriation Achievements:**

**1945-1947 Operations:**
- Transported ~100,000+ Japanese personnel (estimate across all 14)
- Multiple voyages each ship
- Korea, China, Southeast Asia, Pacific islands
- Humanitarian mission under dire circumstances
- Prevented starvation, exposure deaths
- United families separated by war

**Conditions:**
- Ships overcrowded
- Minimal supplies
- Damaged ports
- Allied supervision
- Former enemy now helpers

**Legacy:** Tachibana-class achieved unique distinction - only IJN destroyer class with 100% survival rate (0 combat losses). But distinction hollow - survived because commissioned too late for combat (February-August 1945). War ended before attrition took toll. Represented improved Matsu design - good ships but irrelevant timing. All 14 used for vital repatriation duty 1945-1947, transporting Japanese personnel from overseas. Scrapped 1947-1948 as war reparations. None preserved. Showed Japan could refine emergency designs but couldn't change war's outcome. Last destroyers built for Imperial Japanese Navy. Names: Flowers and plants (Tachibana=Orange, Nashi=Pear, Sumire=Violet, Sakura=Cherry, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Tachibana-class embodied "too little, too late." Improved Matsu design - slightly larger, better equipped, refined. But commissioned February-August 1945 when war already lost. 100% survival rate (unique) meant only that they arrived after fighting ended. War surrendered August 15, 1945 - last ship (Wakazakura) commissioned August 5 - 10 days before surrender. Essentially brand-new ships that never fought. Post-war redemption: Vital repatriation service 1945-1947. All 14 transported thousands of Japanese from overseas, prevented humanitarian disaster. Then scrapped as reparations. Showed Japan maintained industrial capability to war's end but couldn't reverse strategic situation. Good designs, good ships, but history already written.
