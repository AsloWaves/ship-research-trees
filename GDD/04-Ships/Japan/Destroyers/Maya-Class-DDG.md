Evolution visible: Kongo (1993, first Aegis, 90 VLS, SM-2) → Atago (2007, improved, 96 VLS, SM-3 IIA) → Maya (2020, latest, 96 VLS, SM-6, CEC). Continuous advancement, world-class capability. Names honor WWII heavy cruisers Maya and Haguro - historical continuity. Maya-class: Most capable Japanese destroyers ever built.

**Historical Significance:** Maya-class represent modern Japan's world-class naval capability. Commissioned 2020-2021 during growing regional threats: China military expansion (largest navy by numbers), North Korea missile/nuclear programs. Japan responded with most advanced destroyers: Aegis J7.B, SM-6 extended-range missiles, network warfare (CEC), advanced ASW. Technology blend: US Aegis system, Japanese enhancements (OQQ-24 sonar, FCS-3A radar), cooperative development (SM-3 Block IIA joint US-Japan). Shows Japanese technological sophistication - from 1945 devastation to 2020 world-class warships. Both ships named for WWII cruisers lost in battle (Maya at Palawan, Haguro at Penang) - remembers history while serving peaceful defensive mission. Maritime Self-Defense Force (not officially "navy") operates some of world's most capable warships. Maya-class will defend Japan for 40-50 years (to 2060s-2070s) - generational capability. Evolution: WWII Maya cruiser (1932, 10× 8-inch guns, sunk 1944) → Modern Maya DDG (2020, 96 VLS, SM-6, Aegis, CEC) = From gunships to network warfare. Different eras, same dedication to Japan's defense.
