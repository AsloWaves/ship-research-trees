**Tiny Veterans** - Wakatake-class were small destroyers built post-WWI. 8 ships commissioned 1923-1924. Very small (820 tons), three 4.7-inch guns, four torpedoes, 39 knots. Obsolete by 1930s. Seven reclassified as patrol boats 1940 or scrapped pre-war. Only one served WWII as destroyer (Sanae, lost 1944). Represented economic 1920s building - cheap, simple, effective for peacetime but inadequate for modern war.

**Key Specs:** 820/1,030 tons | 275ft | 39 kn | 3× 120mm + 4× 533mm torpedoes | Unarmored | 8 ships

**Innovation:** Post-WWI economical destroyers. Very small (820 tons - smaller than Momi at 850 tons) but high speed (39 knots). Three 4.7-inch guns (minimal). Four 21-inch torpedoes. Good range (3,600 nm) for size. Built cheap during economic constraints 1920s. By 1940, most obsolete - seven reclassified as patrol boats or scrapped. Only Sanae fought WWII as destroyer (lost 1944). Showed economic reality - cheap ships became obsolete quickly. Design too small for modern warfare.

**Design:** Three single 4.7-inch guns (one forward, two aft). Four single 21-inch torpedo tubes. Minimal AA (none originally, 2× 13mm MG added later). Depth charges for ASW (added). Very small (820 tons). Small crew (110). High speed (39 knots) from powerful engines relative to size. Light construction, no armor. Simple, economical. Good for 1920s peacetime but inadequate for 1940s war. Cramped for crew. Limited range (3,600 nm).

**Ships (8 built):**

**Reclassified as Patrol Boats (7 ships, 1940):**
1. **Wakatake** - Patrol Boat No. 31, fate unknown (likely scrapped or lost)
2. **Kuretake** - Patrol Boat No. 32, sunk March 1944 (submarine)
3. **Sanae** - **Retained as destroyer**, sunk March 31, 1944 (air attack, Palau)
4. **Sawarabi** - Patrol Boat No. 33, fate unknown
5. **Asagao** - Patrol Boat No. 34, sunk June 1944 (air attack)
6. **Yugao** - Patrol Boat No. 35, fate unknown
7. **Fuyo** - Patrol Boat No. 36, scrapped pre-war or early war
8. **Karukaya** - Patrol Boat No. 37, fate unknown

**Construction:**
- Builders: Ishikawajima, Fujinagata, Uraga
- Laid down: 1921-1922
- Commissioned: 1923-1924

**Service History:**

**Peacetime Service (1923-1940):**
- Fleet exercises
- Training
- China operations (1930s)
- Already small and obsolete by 1930
- Limited use

**1940 - Reclassification:**
**Decision:**
- 7 of 8 too small for modern destroyer service
- Still useful for coastal patrol
- **Reclassified as Patrol Boats** (Nos. 31-37)
- Removed from destroyer list
- Only Sanae retained as destroyer

**Why Reclassified:**
1. **Too small:** 820 tons inadequate
2. **Weak armament:** 3 guns insufficient
3. **Old:** 17-18 years old by 1940
4. **Still useful:** Patrol, escort, ASW capable
5. **Fleet needs:** Real destroyers needed elsewhere

**Sanae - Only Destroyer Service:**
*Last Wakatake as destroyer*

**1940-1944:**
- Retained destroyer designation
- Convoy escort
- Patrol duties
- ASW operations

**March 31, 1944 - Sinking:**
- At Palau
- **US carrier air raid**
- Hit by bombs
- Sank in harbor
- Heavy casualties

**Patrol Boat Service:**

**7 ships as patrol boats (1940-1945):**
**Missions:**
- Coastal patrol
- Harbor defense
- ASW patrols
- Convoy escort (local)
- Minesweeping (some)

**Known Losses:**
- **Kuretake (No. 32):** Sunk March 1944 (submarine)
- **Asagao (No. 34):** Sunk June 1944 (air attack)
- Others: Fate uncertain (likely lost or scrapped)

**Loss Statistics (Overall):**
- **8 built**
- **Known lost:** At least 3 (Sanae, Kuretake, Asagao)
- **Fate uncertain:** 5 (likely lost or scrapped 1944-1945)
- **Survival rate:** Probably 0% (none confirmed surviving)

**120mm/45 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Momi, Kamikaze classes
- **Caliber:** 120mm (4.7 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 15,000 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 8-10 rounds per minute
- Only 3 guns (minimal for destroyer)

**Comparison - Small 1920s Destroyers:**
| Class | Displacement | Main Guns | Torpedoes | Speed | Ships | WWII Use |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Wakatake** | **820 tons** | **3× 4.7"** | **4× 21"** | **39 kn** | **8** | **1 destroyer, 7 patrol boats** |
| Momi | 850 tons | 3× 4.7" | 4× 21" | 36 kn | 21 | 4 destroyers, 13 patrol boats |
| Kamikaze | 1,270 tons | 4× 4.7" | 6× 21" | 37 kn | 9 | 9 destroyers (6 lost) |

**Wakatake: Smallest, mostly converted**

**Why So Small:**

**1920s Context:**
- Post-WWI economy
- Naval budget cuts
- Need for numbers
- Peacetime sufficient

**Design Philosophy:**
- Minimum cost
- Maximum numbers
- Adequate for peacetime
- Economic constraints priority

**Result:**
- 8 cheap destroyers
- But too small for war
- Most converted or scrapped

**Why Mostly Converted:**

**By 1940:**
1. **17 years old:** Built 1923, old by 1940
2. **820 tons:** Too small for modern combat
3. **3 guns:** Inadequate firepower
4. **Limited AA:** Vulnerable to aircraft
5. **Still useful:** Coastal patrol yes, fleet combat no

**Decision:** Convert 7 to patrol boats, keep 1 as destroyer

**Tactical Employment (WWII):**

**Sanae (as destroyer):**
- Convoy escort (short range)
- Coastal patrol
- ASW patrols
- Harbor defense
- Not fleet operations (too small)

**Patrol Boats (7 ships):**
- Coastal defense
- Harbor patrol
- ASW patrols
- Convoy escort (local)
- Minesweeping

**Legacy:** Wakatake-class represented 1920s economic constraints - build cheap, small destroyers for numbers. Eight ships (820 tons) built 1923-1924. High speed (39 knots) for size but too small for modern war. By 1940, seven reclassified as patrol boats (Nos. 31-37), one retained as destroyer (Sanae). Sanae sunk March 1944 at Palau. Patrol boats mostly lost or scrapped 1944-1945. Showed emergency/economic construction produces limited-lifespan ships. Names: Plants and grasses (Wakatake=Young Bamboo, Sanae=Rice Seedling, etc.).

**Historical Significance:** Wakatake-class epitomized post-WWI economic destroyer building. Smallest destroyers with significant capability (820 tons, 39 knots, 3 guns, 4 torpedoes). Built cheap during budget constraints 1920s. But too small for modern warfare - by 1940 (17 years old), seven reclassified as patrol boats. Only Sanae fought WWII as destroyer (lost March 1944). Showed that economic constraints produce compromised designs with short useful lives. Compare to Fleet destroyers (2,000+ tons) - those lasted entire war. Wakatake-class: 17 years peacetime, mostly converted before significant combat. Lesson: Cheap ships become expensive when war comes and they're inadequate. Better to build fewer good ships than many poor ones.
