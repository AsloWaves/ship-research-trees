**Night Battle Cruisers** - Aoba-class were early treaty heavy cruisers, improved Furutaka design. 2 ships built 1927. Six 8-inch guns + eight 24-inch torpedoes. High speed (35 knots). Both lost in Guadalcanal campaign. Kinugasa sunk November 1942 (Battle of Guadalcanal). Aoba survived multiple battles but sunk July 1945 (Kure air raid).

**Key Specs:** 9,000/11,660 tons | 602ft | 35 kn | 6× 203mm + 8× 610mm Type 93 torpedoes + 50+ 25mm AA | 76mm belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Improved Furutaka-class - three twin 8-inch turrets instead of single mounts. Better armor distribution. Higher speed (35 knots). Six 8-inch guns standard for 10,000-ton treaty cruisers. Eight Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes. Light armor for speed. Good range (8,000 nm). Represented transition from early to mature treaty cruiser design. Both ships saw extensive combat in Guadalcanal night actions.

**Design:** Three twin 8-inch turrets (two forward superfiring, one aft). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers. High speed (35 knots). Light armor (3-inch belt). Two floatplanes with catapult. Four 4.7-inch secondary guns. Good seakeeping. Designed for fleet operations and night surface combat. Emphasis on speed and firepower over protection.

**Comparison - Early Treaty Cruisers:**
| Class | Ships | Guns | Displacement | Speed |
|-------|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Aoba** | **2** | **6× 8"** | **9,000** | **35 kn** |
| Furutaka | 2 | 6× 8" | 8,700 | 34.5 kn |
| Pensacola | 2 | 10× 8" | 9,100 | 32.5 kn |
| Kent | 7 | 8× 8" | 9,750 | 31.5 kn |

**Why Both Lost:**
- **Kinugasa:** Sunk by air power (dive bombers)
- **Aoba:** Survived battles but sunk in port by air power
- Light armor made both vulnerable
- Cape Esperance showed radar advantage negated night-fighting
- Both demonstrated obsolescence of light cruisers by 1945

**Legacy:** Aoba-class represented early Japanese heavy cruiser design - improved Furutaka with better gun layout. Both saw extensive combat in Guadalcanal campaign. Kinugasa sunk by air attack November 1942. Aoba heavily damaged at Cape Esperance (Admiral Goto killed), survived until July 1945. Both demonstrated Japanese night-fighting doctrine and its limitations against radar. Savo Island victory showed potential. Cape Esperance defeat showed radar changed warfare. Names: Aoba (mountain), Kinugasa (mountain) - mountains in Japan.

**Historical Significance:** Aoba-class epitomized transition from early to mature treaty cruiser design. Both ships central to Guadalcanal naval battles - Savo Island victory, Cape Esperance defeat, Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Demonstrated both effectiveness and vulnerability of light cruisers. Admiral Goto's death on Aoba symbolized high command casualties in desperate battles. Kinugasa's loss to air power showed vulnerability. Aoba's survival to July 1945 remarkable - lasted through entire war despite heavy damage multiple times. Both ships showed evolution of naval warfare from surface night actions to air-dominated combat.
