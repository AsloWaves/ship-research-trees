**Treaty Cruiser Evolution** - Mogami-class were designed as light cruisers (15× 6.1-inch guns) but converted to heavy cruisers (10× 8-inch guns) 1939-1940. 4 ships. Treaty loophole - built as light, upgraded to heavy. High speed (35+ knots). All four sunk 1942-1944. Mogami converted to hybrid cruiser-carrier 1943.

**Key Specs:** 12,200/13,670 tons | 656ft | 35 kn | 10× 203mm + 8× 127mm DP + 12× 610mm torpedoes | 100mm belt | 4 ships

**Innovation:** Designed to exploit London Naval Treaty loophole. Built as light cruisers with 15× 6.1-inch guns (treaty compliant), then upgraded to 10× 8-inch heavy guns (treaty expired). Maximum armament for light cruisers (15 guns). First IJN cruisers with triple 6-inch turrets. After conversion, had standard heavy cruiser armament. Two ships (Mogami, Mikuma) later converted to hybrid cruiser-carriers with aircraft hangar.

**Design (As Built 1935):** Fifteen 6.1-inch guns in five triple turrets (three forward superfiring, two aft). Most heavily armed light cruisers ever built. High speed (35 knots). Welded construction (weight savings). Light armor. Twelve 24-inch torpedo tubes. Three floatplanes.

**Design (After 1940 Conversion):** Forward turrets replaced with five twin 8-inch turrets (superfiring fore and aft, one amidships). Standard heavy cruiser configuration. Armor increased. Displacement increased to 12,200 tons. Speed unchanged. Became equivalent to Takao-class.

**Ships:**
- **Mogami** - Damaged at Midway, converted to hybrid carrier 1943, sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Surigao Strait), 192 killed
- **Mikuma** - Sunk June 6, 1942 (Battle of Midway, dive bomber attack), 650 killed
- **Suzuya** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle off Samar, air attack/magazine explosion), 618 killed

**Legacy:** Mogami-class demonstrated Japan's willingness to circumvent treaty restrictions. Built as maximum-armed light cruisers, converted to heavy cruisers when treaty expired. All four lost in combat - attrition showed vulnerability of lightly armored cruisers. Mogami hybrid conversion proved impractical (like Ise-class). Mikuma loss at Midway showed effectiveness of US dive bombers. Surigao Strait (Mogami) and Samar (Suzuya, Kumano) showed desperate nature of Japanese operations late war. Names: "Mogami" (river), "Mikuma" (river), "Suzuya" (river), "Kumano" (river) - all named after rivers.

**Historical Significance:** Embodied interwar treaty circumvention - letter of law vs spirit of law. Design showed Japan's technical skill - cramming 15 guns on light cruiser displacement. Conversion to heavy cruisers showed adaptability. Combat record showed vulnerability - all four sunk, most in desperate final battles (Midway, Surigao Strait, Samar). Represented IJN's aggressive cruiser doctrine - heavy guns, heavy torpedoes, high speed, light armor. Trade-offs proved fatal in combat.
