**First Post-WWI Cruisers** - Kuma-class were first post-WWI Japanese light cruisers. 5 ships built 1920-1921. Seven 5.5-inch guns + eight 24-inch torpedoes. High speed (36 knots). All five lost 1943-1946. Kitakami and Oi converted to torpedo cruisers (40 torpedoes each), then kaiten suicide submarine carriers - most unusual conversions in naval history.

**Key Specs:** 5,100/5,832 tons | 535ft | 36 kn | 7× 140mm + 8× 610mm torpedoes | 63mm belt | 5 ships

**Innovation:** First Japanese cruisers built after WWI. High speed (36 knots) for 1920s. Seven single 5.5-inch guns. Last cruisers with mixed coal/oil firing. Kitakami and Oi underwent most radical conversions - torpedo cruisers with 40 tubes (1941-1942), then kaiten carriers (1944-1945). Represented 1920s destroyer-leader concept. All five saw extensive WWII service despite age.

**Design:** Seven single 5.5-inch guns (four forward, three aft - all centerline). Two quad 24-inch torpedo launchers. High speed (36 knots). Light armor (2.5-inch belt). Mixed coal/oil boilers. One floatplane. Mine-laying capability. Long, sleek hull. Destroyer-leader role.

**Ships:**
- **Kuma** - Sunk January 11, 1944 (submarine USS Guitarro)
- **Tama** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (submarine USS Jallao)
- **Kitakami** - Survived war (kaiten carrier), scrapped 1946-1947
- **Oi** - Sunk July 19, 1944 (submarine USS Flasher)
- **Kiso** - Sunk November 13, 1944 (air attack, Manila Bay)

**Construction:**
- **Kuma:** Sasebo Naval Arsenal, laid down August 29, 1918, launched July 14, 1919, commissioned August 31, 1920
- **Tama:** Mitsubishi Yokohama, laid down August 10, 1918, launched February 10, 1920, commissioned January 29, 1921
- **Kitakami:** Sasebo Naval Arsenal, laid down June 1, 1919, launched July 3, 1920, commissioned April 15, 1921
- **Oi:** Kawasaki Kobe, laid down November 24, 1918, launched July 15, 1920, commissioned October 3, 1921
- **Kiso:** Mitsubishi Nagasaki, laid down June 10, 1919, launched December 14, 1920, commissioned May 4, 1921

**Kitakami and Oi - Torpedo Cruiser Conversion (1941-1942):**
*Most heavily armed torpedo ships ever*

**Reason for Conversion:**
- Experimental concept: overwhelm enemy with massive torpedo salvo
- Remove most guns, add 10 quad torpedo launchers
- **40× 24-inch torpedoes** (Type 93 Long Lance)
- Could fire devastating salvos

**Conversion Details:**
- Five 5.5-inch guns removed (kept 2 forward)
- Ten quad 24-inch torpedo launchers added (5 per side)
- Total: 40 torpedo tubes
- Most torpedoes ever on cruiser-size ship
- Could fire 20-torpedo broadsides
- Completed 1942

**Why Conversion Failed:**
- Topweight problems - unstable
- Reloading torpedoes at sea impossible
- One salvo, then retreat to reload
- Never used in combat as torpedo cruisers
- Concept proved impractical
- 1944: Converted again to kaiten carriers

**Kitakami and Oi - Kaiten Carrier Conversion (1944-1945):**
*From torpedo cruiser to suicide submarine carrier*

**Kaiten Background:**
- Manned suicide submarines
- Based on Type 93 oxygen torpedo
- Pilot guided to target, then detonate
- Kamikaze equivalent for underwater

**Conversion:**
- Torpedo launchers removed
- Rails installed for 8 kaiten submarines
- Carried kaiten on deck
- Launch from stern ramps
- Both ships converted 1944-1945

**Service as Kaiten Carriers:**
- **Kitakami:** Survived war, never used operationally
- **Oi:** Sunk by submarine before kaiten service began

**Service - Standard Configuration:**

**Kuma (1920-1944):**
- 1920s-1930s: China operations, fleet exercises
- 1941-1942: Philippines, Dutch East Indies invasions
- 1943: Rabaul, Solomons operations
- **January 11, 1944:** Torpedoed by USS Guitarro off Penang
- Sank with heavy casualties

**Tama (1921-1944):**
- China operations 1920s-1930s
- 1941-1942: Philippines, Dutch East Indies
- **Battle of Philippine Sea (June 1944):** Survived
- **October 25, 1944:** Cape Engano - damaged by carrier aircraft
- Limping back to Japan
- **October 25, 1944:** Finished off by USS Jallao (submarine)

**Oi (1921-1944):**
- China operations
- 1941: Converted to torpedo cruiser
- Never used torpedo armament in combat
- 1944: Kaiten conversion begun
- **July 19, 1944:** Torpedoed by USS Flasher before kaiten service
- Sank in South China Sea

**Kiso (1921-1944):**
- China operations 1920s-1930s
- 1941-1944: Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Solomons
- **November 13, 1944:** Air attack in Manila Bay
- Hit by bombs and rockets
- Capsized and sank

**Kitakami's Survival (1921-1946):**
- 1941: Torpedo cruiser conversion
- Never used in combat as torpedo cruiser
- 1944-1945: Kaiten carrier conversion
- Never used operationally with kaiten
- **August 15, 1945:** Surrendered at Yokosuka
- Damaged but intact
- Scrapped 1946-1947
- **Only Kuma-class to survive war**

**140mm/50 Type 3 Gun Specifications:**
- Same as Sendai-class
- **Caliber:** 140mm (5.5 inches)
- **Maximum range:** 19,750 meters
- **Rate of fire:** 5-7 rounds per minute

**Loss Statistics:**
- **5 built, 4 sunk, 1 survived**
- **Causes:**
  - Submarine: 3 ships (Kuma, Tama, Oi)
  - Air attack: 1 ship (Kiso)
  - Survived: 1 ship (Kitakami)
- **Survival rate:** 20% (1 of 5)

**Torpedo Cruiser Concept:**
**Theory:**
- Fire massive torpedo salvos (40 tubes)
- Overwhelm enemy fleet
- Long Lance range allowed standoff attack

**Reality:**
- Topweight made ships unstable
- Could only fire once before retreating
- Reloading at sea impossible
- Never used in combat
- Concept abandoned

**Comparison - Kuma vs Torpedo Cruiser Configuration:**
| Feature | Original (1920) | Torpedo Cruiser (1942) |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Main guns | 7× 5.5" | 2× 5.5" |
| Torpedoes | 8× 24" | 40× 24" |
| Stability | Good | Poor (topweight) |
| Combat use | Extensive | None |

**Kaiten Operations:**
- **Concept:** Launch manned suicide subs from cruiser
- **Kitakami role:** Carry 8 kaiten, launch near enemy
- **Reality:** War ended before operational use
- **Survivors:** Some kaiten pilots survived war (didn't launch)

**Why Kitakami Survived:**
- Converted to torpedo cruiser - rarely used
- Then kaiten carrier - never used operationally
- Spent most of war in port being converted
- Avoided combat that killed other four
- Lucky through obsolescence

**Legacy:** Kuma-class were first post-WWI Japanese cruisers. High speed (36 knots) impressive for 1920s. Four of five sunk 1944 (submarines and air). Kitakami and Oi most unusual conversions - torpedo cruisers (40 torpedoes each), then kaiten suicide sub carriers. Torpedo cruiser concept failed - topweight, impractical, never used in combat. Kaiten conversions showed desperation - turning cruisers into suicide weapon platforms. Only Kitakami survived - avoided combat through constant conversions. Names: Rivers in Japan.

**Historical Significance:** Kuma-class showed Japanese early destroyer-leader concept. High speed, light armament. Kitakami and Oi's radical conversions epitomized Japanese experimental desperation - torpedo cruiser idea ahead of its time but impractical, kaiten conversions reflected suicide tactics. Three sunk by submarines showed US submarine effectiveness. Tama's loss at Cape Engano while crippled showed vulnerability. Kitakami's survival through non-use ironic - most modified ship survived because never fought. Represented obsolete 1920s design still fighting in 1944.
