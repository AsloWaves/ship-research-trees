**First Modern Battleships** - Fuji-class were Japan's first modern battleships. 2 ships commissioned 1897-1898. Built in United Kingdom (British shipyards, British expertise). 12,533 tons, 18 knots, 4× 12-inch guns (2 twin turrets), 10× 6-inch secondary. Harvey nickel-steel armor (18-inch belt maximum). Pre-dreadnought design (mixed main/secondary batteries, reciprocating engines). Both fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). Yashima lost May 1904 (mine off Port Arthur). Fuji survived war, served until 1922 (25 years service). Foundation of Japanese battleship development - established pattern for all future IJN battleships.

**Key Specs:** 12,320/12,533 tons | 412ft | 18 kn | 4× 12-inch + 10× 6-inch | 2 ships | 1 lost

**Innovation:** **First modern battleships for Japan** (1897-1898). Revolutionary leap from previous obsolete ships. Ordered from United Kingdom (Japan lacked industrial capacity 1890s). Built by **Thames Iron Works** (Fuji) and **Armstrong Whitworth** (Yashima) - top British yards. British design: Twin 12-inch gun turrets (fore/aft), extensive secondary battery (10× 6-inch, 14× 12-pounder), Harvey nickel-steel armor (cutting-edge 1890s), triple-expansion steam engines (reliable, proven). Pre-dreadnought layout: Mixed batteries (main guns + many secondary for torpedo boat defense), central citadel armor, modest speed (18 knots). Established pattern for Japanese battleships: Foreign expertise → domestic construction → indigenous design (progression over decades). Showed Japan's commitment to modern navy (massive investment, British technology transfer). Influenced: Shikishima-class (improved Fuji), then Mikasa (peak pre-dreadnought), eventually Kongo/Nagato (indigenous designs).

**Design:** Classic pre-dreadnought battleship hull (412 ft, 12,533 tons). **Four 12-inch (305mm) guns**: Two twin turrets (one forward, one aft). Hydraulically operated, slow-firing (~1 round/2 minutes). **Ten 6-inch (152mm) secondary guns**: Single casemate mounts along sides (torpedo boat defense). 14× 12-pounder (76mm) quick-firing guns (anti-torpedo boat). Five 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes (bow, stern, broadside - standard 1890s). **Heavy armor**: 18-inch Harvey nickel-steel belt (advanced for era, hardened face), 2.5-inch deck, 14-inch turrets, 14-inch conning tower. Two military masts (fighting tops). Two funnels (boilers). **Twin screw propulsion**: Two triple-expansion reciprocating engines, 13,500 indicated horsepower, coal-fired boilers. 18 knots maximum (adequate 1890s). Range 4,000 nm at 10 knots. Crew 637 (large for era - manual systems). Robust, seaworthy design (British expertise). Profile: Distinctive 1890s battleship look - high freeboard, military masts, twin turrets.

   - First major Japanese battleship loss

**Construction:**

- **Builders:** Thames Iron Works (Fuji), Armstrong Whitworth (Yashima) - British yards
- **Design:** British naval architects (Japanese specifications)
- **Why British-built:**
  1. Japan lacked industrial capacity 1890s (no battleship yards)
  2. Technology transfer (learn British methods)
  3. Speed (British yards experienced, fast construction)
  4. Quality (British Navy world's best - expertise proven)
- **Laid down:** 1894 (both ships)
- **Launched:** 1896 (both ships)
- **Commissioned:** 1897 (Fuji August, Yashima September)
- **Cost:** £840,000 each (massive expenditure for Japan - equivalent to ~10% of annual budget!)
- **Build time:** ~3 years (standard for 1890s battleships)

**Service History:**

**1897-1904 (Peacetime/Build-up):**
- Fuji commissioned August 1897 (first modern battleship)
- Yashima September 1897
- Fleet training (cruises, gunnery practice)
- Showed Japanese flag (prestige ships)
- Diplomatic tool (modern navy = modern nation)
- **May 15, 1904**: **Yashima LOST**
  - Struck mine off Port Arthur
  - Sank with heavy casualties (~180-190 killed)
  - Early war loss (50% of class gone!)

**1904-1905 (Russo-Japanese War - Fuji Alone):**

**Background:**
- Japan vs Russia over Manchuria/Korea control
- Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur (fortified base)
- Japanese strategy: Destroy Russian fleet

**Fuji's Battles:**

**Battle of the Yellow Sea (August 10, 1904):**
- Russian fleet attempted breakout from Port Arthur
- Admiral Togo's fleet intercepted
- Fuji engaged Russian battleships
- Long-range gunnery duel (6,000-8,000 yards)
- Fuji hit several times but armor held
- Russians turned back (failed breakout)
- Fuji survived (minor damage)

**Battle of Tsushima (May 27-28, 1905):**
- **Decisive naval battle** - most important
- Russian Baltic Fleet arrived after 7-month voyage
- Admiral Togo's fleet (Fuji in line of battle)
- **May 27, 1905**: Main engagement
  - Togo's "T" crossing maneuver (classic naval tactic)
  - Japanese battleships concentrated fire
  - Fuji engaged Russian battleships
  - Superior Japanese gunnery (faster firing, more accurate)
  - Russian fleet devastated (8 battleships sunk/captured)
- **May 28**: Pursuit and mopping up
- **Japanese victory** - one of most decisive in naval history
- Fuji survived undamaged
- Russia sued for peace (Treaty of Portsmouth September 1905)

**1905-1922 (Post-War Service):**
- Coast defense ship (obsolete by 1910s)
- Dreadnought revolution (HMS Dreadnought 1906) made pre-dreadnoughts obsolete
- WWI: Patrol duties (Japan allied with Britain)
- Training ship (1918+)
- Disarmed 1922 (Washington Naval Treaty - scrap old battleships)
- Hulked, used as barracks/storage

**1922-1948 (Hulk):**
- Stripped of weapons
- Floating barracks at Yokosuka
- Survived WWII (hulk, no military value)
- Scrapped 1948 (51 years after commissioning!)

**Russo-Japanese War Context:**

**Why Significant:**
- First major war between modern industrialized powers since Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871)
- First time Asian power defeated European power (Japan vs Russia)
- Demonstrated Japanese modernization success
- Showed battleship power (decisive sea control)

**Japanese Naval Strategy:**
- Destroy Russian Pacific Fleet (trap at Port Arthur, engage when sorties)
- Prevent Russian reinforcement from Baltic Fleet
- Control seas = control war (supply Korea/Manchuria)

**Results:**
- Japan decisive victory (Tsushima: 34 Russian ships vs 4 Japanese ships lost)
- Treaty of Portsmouth (September 1905): Japan gained Korea, southern Sakhalin, Port Arthur lease
- Japan recognized as major power
- Fuji-class contribution: Part of battleship line that won decisive battles

**Yashima Loss - Mine Warfare:**

**May 15, 1904 - Disaster:**
- **Location:** Off Port Arthur (Liaodong Peninsula)
- **Mission:** Bombardment of Port Arthur fortifications
- **Attack:** Struck Russian mine (defensive minefield)
- **Damage:**
  - Mine exploded under hull (port side)
  - Massive hole below waterline
  - Flooding rapid (compartments filled)
  - Counter-flooding attempted (failed - too much damage)
  - List increased progressively
- **Sinking:**
  - Capsized to port
  - Sank within hours
  - 450 crew rescued by escorts
  - ~180-190 killed (trapped below, drowned)
- **Impact:**
  - Loss of major battleship (fleet reduced)
  - Japanese Navy more cautious with battleships
  - Emphasis on mine countermeasures

**Mine Warfare 1904:**
- Russian defense: Extensive minefields around Port Arthur
- Japanese problem: No effective minesweeping (early technology)
- Mines sank/damaged: Yashima (battleship), Hatsuse (battleship, same day!), multiple cruisers/destroyers
- Changed tactics: More cautious approaches, torpedo boat reconnaissance, destroyer sweeps

**British Design Influence:**

**Technology Transfer:**
- Japanese observers at British yards during construction
- British engineers supervised building
- Documentation (blueprints, specifications) provided
- Training: Japanese officers trained on British battleships

**Design Features from British:**
1. **Twin turret layout** (fore/aft main battery)
2. **Central citadel armor** (protect vital spaces)
3. **Mixed battery** (main + secondary for different ranges)
4. **Harvey armor** (face-hardened nickel-steel - British patent)
5. **Triple-expansion engines** (British standard, reliable)
6. **Casemate secondary guns** (hull mounts, protected)

**Applied to Future Japanese Ships:**
- Shikishima-class (1898-1900): Improved Fuji
- Mikasa (1902): Refined pre-dreadnought
- Katori/Kashima (1905-1906): Last pre-dreadnoughts
- Eventually: Kongo (1913, British-built battlecruiser) → Fuso/Ise/Nagato (indigenous designs)

**Progression: British-built → British-designed, Japanese-built → Japanese-designed and built**

**18-inch Belt Armor - Exceptional:**

**Harvey Nickel-Steel:**
- Patented by Hayward Augustus Harvey (American engineer)
- Licensed to British companies
- Face-hardened (carbonized surface, tough backing)
- Superior to previous wrought iron/compound armor
- **18 inches maximum** on Fuji-class (thickest parts of belt)
- Reduced to 14 inches on ends, 12 inches on extremities
- Backed by teak wood (absorb shock), then steel hull plating

**Effectiveness:**
- Battle of the Yellow Sea: Fuji hit multiple times by Russian 12-inch shells, armor held
- Russo-Japanese War: Armor proved effective (Japanese battleships survived hits that would have crippled earlier ships)
- Standard 1890s: Battleship armor 12-16 inches typical, Fuji's 18 inches exceptional for size

**Comparison - 1890s Battleships:**

| Class | Nation | Year | Tons | Speed | Guns | Belt Armor | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|------|-------|------|------------|-------|
| **Fuji** | **Japan** | **1897** | **12,533** | **18 kn** | **4× 12-inch** | **18 inches** | **First Japanese modern BBs** |
| Royal Sovereign | UK | 1892 | 14,150 | 17.5 kn | 4× 13.5-inch | 18 inches | British pre-dreadnought |
| Majestic | UK | 1895 | 14,900 | 17 kn | 4× 12-inch | 9 inches | Many built (9 ships) |
| Indiana | USA | 1895 | 10,288 | 15 kn | 4× 13-inch | 18 inches | US coastal defense |
| Petropavlovsk | Russia | 1899 | 11,354 | 16 kn | 4× 12-inch | 16 inches | Fuji's opponents 1904-1905 |

**Fuji Characteristics:**
- **Moderate size** (12,533 tons - larger than some, smaller than British)
- **Good speed** (18 knots - adequate for era)
- **Heavy armor** (18 inches - matched best)
- **Standard armament** (4× 12-inch twin turrets - typical layout)
- **British quality** (construction excellence)

**50+ Year Existence - Remarkable:**

**Fuji's Longevity:**
- Commissioned: August 17, 1897
- Disarmed: 1922 (25 years active service)
- Hulked: 1922-1948 (26 years as hulk)
- Scrapped: 1948
- **Total existence: 51 years!**

**Why So Long:**
1. **Quality construction**: British-built, robust design
2. **Strong hull**: Survived battles, storms, decades of use
3. **Post-disarmament use**: Floating barracks (cheap accommodation)
4. **WWII survival**: Hulk had no military value (not bombed)
5. **Japan's respect**: Historical ship, Tsushima veteran

**Comparison - Battleship Lifespans:**
- Typical 1890s battleship: 20-30 years active, scrapped soon after
- Fuji: 25 years active + 26 years hulked = exceptional
- Mikasa: Preserved as museum ship (only pre-dreadnought preserved worldwide!)
- Most pre-dreadnoughts: Scrapped 1920s (Washington Naval Treaty)

**Legacy:** Fuji-class were Japan's first modern battleships. 2 ships (1897-1898) built in United Kingdom, British design. 12,533 tons, 18 knots, 4× 12-inch guns, 18-inch armor. Established modern battleship pattern for Japan. Both fought Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). Yashima lost May 1904 (mine off Port Arthur, 180-190 killed). Fuji fought Yellow Sea, Tsushima (1905) - survived both battles, proved armor effectiveness. Fuji served 25 years, disarmed 1922 (Washington Treaty), hulked until 1948 (51-year existence!). Foundation of Japanese battleship development: British expertise → Shikishima → Mikasa → eventually indigenous designs (Nagato, Yamato). Fuji-class: Launched Japan into modern naval power era.

**Historical Significance:** Fuji-class marked Japan's entry into modern naval power status. Ordered 1894, commissioned 1897-1898 - rapid modernization (Japan opened 1854, modern battleships 43 years later!). British-built (Japan lacked capacity 1890s) - showed pragmatic approach: Buy best, learn, then build domestically. Technology transfer: Japanese observers at British yards, documentation provided, training given. Progression: Fuji (British-built) → Shikishima (British-designed, Japanese-built at Yokosuka) → Mikasa (British-designed, Japanese modifications) → Kongo (last British assistance) → Nagato (100% indigenous) = 20-year journey to independence. Cost: £840,000 each (~10% Japan's annual budget!) - massive investment, commitment to modern navy. Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905): Fuji fought decisive battles (Yellow Sea, Tsushima), proved battleship power. Yashima loss (mine 1904) taught mine warfare dangers. Tsushima victory (May 1905): Fuji part of line that destroyed Russian Baltic Fleet (8 battleships sunk/captured vs 3 Japanese torpedo boats lost) - one of most decisive naval battles in history. Result: Japan recognized as major power, "rising sun" of Asia. Fuji's 51-year existence (1897-1948) remarkable - quality British construction, survived WWII as hulk. Compared to Mikasa (preserved as museum ship Yokosuka - only surviving pre-dreadnought battleship worldwide!). Fuji-class: Humble beginnings, historic service, foundation of eventual Yamato-class (world's largest battleships). From dependence to dominance in 40 years.
