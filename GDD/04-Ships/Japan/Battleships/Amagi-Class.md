**Fast Battleship Concept** - Amagi-class were planned battlecruisers. 4 ships laid down 1920-1921. Ten 16.1-inch guns, 30 knots, 41,200 tons. Fast battleship/battlecruiser hybrid. Washington Naval Treaty (1922) cancelled all four. Amagi ~40% complete, damaged by Great Kanto Earthquake (1923), scrapped. Akagi ~25% complete, converted to aircraft carrier (sunk Midway 1942). Atago and Takao cancelled early (names later used for heavy cruisers). Showed treaty impact on capital ship arms race.

**Key Specs (planned):** 41,200/47,000 tons | 826ft | 30 kn | 10× 410mm + 16× 140mm | 254mm belt | 0 built

**Innovation:** Fast battleship concept - battlecruiser with battleship guns. Ten 16.1-inch (410mm) guns at 30 knots - faster than battleships (26 knots), more powerful than traditional battlecruisers. Larger than Tosa-class battleships (41,200 vs 39,900 tons). Lighter armor than battleships (10-inch belt vs 11-inch) for speed. Four-shaft turbines (131,200 shp). Modern design for 1920. But Washington Naval Treaty (1922) ended construction. Akagi became famous carrier (Midway veteran). Amagi destroyed by earthquake while under conversion. Showed fast battleship concept ahead of its time.

**Design (planned):** Five twin 16.1-inch turrets (three forward, two aft). Sixteen single 5.5-inch secondary guns. Six 120mm AA guns. Eight 24-inch submerged torpedo tubes. Moderate armor (10-inch belt, 11-inch turrets) - less than battleships for speed. Four-shaft turbines (30 knots). Oil-fired. Long, sleek hull (826 ft). Fast battleship characteristics. Influenced later fast battleship designs worldwide. Revolutionary for 1920 but never completed.

**Ships (4 planned - 0 completed):**
1. **Amagi** - Cancelled 1922, earthquake damaged 1923, scrapped 1924
2. **Akagi** - Cancelled 1922, converted to aircraft carrier, sunk Midway 1942
3. **Atago** - Cancelled 1922 early, name reused for heavy cruiser
4. **Takao** - Cancelled 1922 early, name reused for heavy cruiser

**Construction:**

**Amagi:**
- **Builder:** Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** December 16, 1920
- **Launched:** Never launched as battlecruiser
- **Construction progress:** ~40% complete by treaty
- **Fate:** Earthquake damaged 1923, scrapped 1924

**Akagi:**
- **Builder:** Kure Naval Arsenal
- **Laid down:** December 6, 1920
- **Launched:** April 22, 1925 (as carrier hull)
- **Construction progress:** ~25% complete by treaty as battlecruiser
- **Fate:** Converted to carrier 1923-1927, sunk Midway 1942

**Atago and Takao:**
- Construction barely begun when cancelled
- Names later used for Takao-class heavy cruisers (commissioned 1932)

**Washington Naval Treaty Context:**

**Treaty Signed:** February 6, 1922

**Impact on Amagi-class:**
- All four cancelled
- Japan allowed 2 conversions to carriers (treaty provision)
- **Original plan:** Convert Amagi and Akagi to carriers
- **Problem:** Great Kanto Earthquake (September 1, 1923) damaged Amagi
- **Solution:** Convert Akagi and Kaga instead

**Great Kanto Earthquake (September 1, 1923):**
*Amagi's Fate Sealed*

**Background:**
- Amagi at Yokosuka being prepared for carrier conversion
- Hull structure modified, ~40% conversion complete
- Massive earthquake struck Tokyo/Yokosuka region

**Damage to Amagi:**
- Hull structure twisted by earthquake
- Slipway collapsed
- Foundation shifted
- Keel damaged
- Structural integrity compromised
- **Beyond economical repair**

**Decision:**
- Scrap Amagi
- Convert Kaga (Tosa-class battleship) to carrier instead
- Akagi conversion continued

**Result:**
- Amagi scrapped 1924
- Never launched as either battlecruiser or carrier
- Earthquake changed naval history

**Akagi Conversion to Carrier:**

**Decision (1922-1923):**
- Battlecruiser hull ~25% complete
- Treaty allowed conversion
- Use existing hull (faster than new build)
- **Originally Amagi + Akagi planned**
- **Earthquake forced Akagi + Kaga instead**

**Conversion (1923-1927):**
- Battlecruiser hull modified extensively
- Three flight decks originally (unique design)
- Later modified to single deck (1935-1938)
- High speed retained (31 knots - good for carrier)
- **Commissioned:** March 25, 1927

**Akagi as Carrier:**
- Pearl Harbor attack (December 1941) - flagship
- Wake Island, Rabaul operations (1942)
- **Battle of Midway (June 4, 1942):** Hit by dive bombers from USS Enterprise
- Fires uncontrollable
- Scuttled by Japanese destroyers
- 267 killed

**Significance:**
- Most famous cancelled battlecruiser (as carrier)
- Pearl Harbor veteran
- Midway loss pivotal

**410mm/45 Gun Specifications:**
**As Designed (never built on Amagi-class):**
- Same guns as planned for Tosa-class
- **Caliber:** 410mm (16.1 inches)
- **Shell weight:** 1,020 kg (2,250 lbs) - estimated
- **Maximum range:** 35,000 meters - estimated
- Would have been formidable armament at 30 knots

**Comparison - Cancelled Battlecruisers:**
| Ship | Nation | Cancelled | Guns | Speed | Fate |
|------|--------|-----------|------|-------|------|
| **Amagi** | **Japan** | **1922** | **10× 16.1"** | **30 kn** | **Earthquake damaged, scrapped** |
| **Akagi** | **Japan** | **1922** | **10× 16.1"** | **30 kn** | **Converted to carrier** |
| Lexington | USA | 1922 | 8× 16" | 33 kn | Converted to carrier |
| Saratoga | USA | 1922 | 8× 16" | 33 kn | Converted to carrier |

**Fast Battleship vs Battlecruiser:**

**Amagi-class Design Philosophy:**
- **Firepower:** Battleship guns (16.1-inch)
- **Speed:** Battlecruiser speed (30 knots)
- **Armor:** Moderate (10-inch belt - between battleship and cruiser)

**Result:** Fast battleship concept (precursor to later designs)

**Influenced Later Ships:**
- German Scharnhorst-class (31 knots, 11-inch guns)
- US Iowa-class (33 knots, 16-inch guns, 1940s)
- Japanese Kongo modernizations (30+ knots, 14-inch guns)

**If Completed (Hypothetical):**

**Amagi-class as Battlecruisers:**
**Strengths:**
- 16.1-inch guns at 30 knots (deadly combination)
- Could catch any cruiser, outrun most battleships
- Good range (8,000 nm)
- Modern design

**Weaknesses:**
- Moderate armor (10-inch belt vulnerable to battleship guns)
- Battlecruiser weakness (Jutland lessons not fully applied)
- Large targets
- Expensive

**Likely Role:**
- Fast striking force
- Commerce raiding
- Carrier escorts (fast enough)
- But: Vulnerable to battleships in slugging match

**Why Battlecruiser Concept Faded:**

**Jutland (1916) Lessons:**
- Three British battlecruisers exploded (thin armor, magazine hits)
- "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today" - Admiral Beatty
- Showed battlecruisers vulnerable

**Post-WWI Trend:**
- Fast battleships replaced battlecruisers
- Heavy armor + high speed (better than light armor + high speed)
- Amagi-class: Transition design (not fully battleship, not fully battlecruiser)

**Result:**
- Concept abandoned
- Fast battleships (Iowa, Littorio, etc.) dominated 1930s-1940s

**Names and Reuse:**

**Amagi:** Mountain - scrapped, name not reused
**Akagi:** Red Castle - carrier (sunk Midway)
**Atago:** Shrine - reused for heavy cruiser (sunk 1944)
**Takao:** Mountain - reused for heavy cruiser (survived war damaged)

**Legacy:** Amagi-class represented Japan's ambitious battlecruiser program. Four ships planned with 16.1-inch guns at 30 knots. Washington Treaty (1922) cancelled all. Akagi converted to carrier - became Pearl Harbor veteran, sunk Midway. Amagi damaged by Great Kanto Earthquake (1923) during conversion, scrapped. Atago and Takao names reused for famous heavy cruisers. Fast battleship concept ahead of its time - influenced later designs. Showed treaty's power to reshape naval forces. Names: Mountains and shrines.

**Historical Significance:** Amagi-class epitomized cancelled naval ambitions. Four battlecruisers with 16.1-inch guns at 30 knots - revolutionary fast battleship concept. Washington Treaty stopped all. Akagi became most famous - converted to carrier, led Pearl Harbor attack, died at Midway (more famous as carrier than would have been as battlecruiser). Amagi's fate tragic - earthquake during carrier conversion (1923) damaged hull beyond repair, scrapped. Historical accident: If no earthquake, Amagi + Akagi would have been carriers; instead Akagi + Kaga. Showed nature could end naval ambitions as decisively as treaties. Fast battleship concept vindicated later (Iowa-class) but Amagi-class never had chance. Represented might-have-been of Japanese naval power.
