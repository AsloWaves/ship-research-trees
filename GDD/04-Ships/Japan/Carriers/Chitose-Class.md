**Converted Seaplane Tenders** - Chitose-class were light carriers converted from seaplane tenders. 2 ships. Originally commissioned 1938 as seaplane tenders, converted to carriers 1943-1944. 631 ft, 30 aircraft. Both sunk October 25, 1944 at Battle of Cape Engano - last major carrier battle in history.

**Key Specs:** 11,190/15,300 tons | 631ft | 29 kn | 30 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 30× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Converted from seaplane tenders - unusual conversion path. Originally designed with conversion in mind (built with carrier potential). Fast conversion (1943-1944). Single hangar deck. Good speed (29 knots). Both participated in final carrier operations 1944. Sunk together at Cape Engano - last carrier battle. Represented desperation conversions to replace Midway losses.

**Design (As Seaplane Tenders, 1938-1943):** Carried 24 floatplanes. Large hangar and flight deck forward. Two catapults. Could launch/recover seaplanes. Fast (29 knots) for fleet operations. Built with conversion to carriers planned.

**Design (As Carriers, 1944):** Flight deck 531 ft (shorter than hull). Single hangar deck. Two elevators. 30 aircraft capacity. Eight 5-inch DP guns. Heavy light AA (30× 25mm). No armor. Speed maintained (29 knots). Relatively quick conversion - hangar and deck already existed from seaplane tender design.

**Ships:**
- **Chitose** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Cape Engano), 900+ killed
- **Chiyoda** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Cape Engano), 800+ killed

  - 1943: Recalled for carrier conversion

- **Chiyoda:**
  - 1938-1941: Fleet exercises, China operations
  - 1941-1942: Philippines, Dutch East Indies invasions
  - **Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942):** Supported carrier force
  - 1942-1943: Solomons operations
  - 1943: Recalled for carrier conversion

**Service as Carriers (1944):**
- **Chitose (January-October 1944):**
  - January-May 1944: Training, work-up
  - **Battle of Philippine Sea (June 19-20, 1944):**
    - Survived "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"
    - Lost most aircraft but ship undamaged
  - October 1944: Battle of Leyte Gulf
  - **October 25, 1944:** Battle of Cape Engano - sunk

- **Chiyoda (October 31-October 25, 1944):**
  - Commissioned October 31, 1944
  - Departed November 1 for Cape Engano operation
  - **Service life: 25 days**
  - **October 25, 1944:** Battle of Cape Engano - sunk

**Battle of Cape Engano (October 25, 1944):**
*Last carrier battle - both ships sunk*

**Background:**
- Part of Admiral Ozawa's Northern Force (decoy carriers)
- Mission: Lure US Third Fleet away from Leyte Gulf
- Force: 4 carriers (Zuikaku, Zuiho, Chitose, Chiyoda), 2 battleship-carriers (Ise, Hyuga)
- Minimal aircraft aboard - pilot/aircraft shortage

**October 25, 1944 - The Battle:**
- **8:00 AM:** Spotted by US reconnaissance
- **8:30 AM:** First wave - 180+ aircraft from USS Lexington, Essex, Langley
- Carriers turned into wind to launch fighters
- Overwhelmed by massive US strikes

**Chitose's Loss:**
- **9:37 AM:** Hit by torpedoes and bombs from first wave
- Aircraft from USS Lexington group
- Multiple torpedo hits portside
- Massive flooding, heavy list
- **9:50 AM:** Capsized and sank
- **900+ killed** (estimates vary)

**Chiyoda's Loss:**
- Survived morning air attacks damaged
- Dead in water, flooding
- **3:00 PM:** US cruisers approached to finish off cripples
- Heavy cruisers shelled Chiyoda
- **4:30 PM:** Capsized and sank from gunfire and flooding
- **800+ killed**

**Cape Engano Results:**
- All 4 Japanese carriers sunk (Zuikaku, Zuiho, Chitose, Chiyoda)
- Last carrier vs carrier battle in history
- Japanese succeeded in luring US Third Fleet away from Leyte
- But Center Force failed to exploit opportunity
- Ozawa's sacrifice was in vain

**Why Conversions:**
1. **Midway losses:** 4 carriers lost June 1942
2. **Desperate need:** Replace carrier strength
3. **Quick conversion:** Seaplane tender design already had hangar/deck
4. **Available hulls:** Not needed as seaplane tenders
5. **Stopgap measure:** Until purpose-built carriers completed

**Conversion Speed:**
- **Chitose:** 1 month (December 1943-January 1944)
- **Chiyoda:** 12 months (October 1943-October 1944)
- Relatively fast compared to other conversions
- But still took valuable shipyard time

**Aircraft Complement:**
- **Design:** 30 aircraft
- **Reality:** Often fewer due to aircraft/pilot shortages
- **Cape Engano:** Minimal aircraft aboard
- Most pilots/aircraft already lost at Philippine Sea
- Carriers essentially decoys by October 1944

**Comparison - Converted Light Carriers:**
| Ship | Original | Converted | Aircraft | Fate |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Chitose** | **Seaplane tender** | **1944** | **30** | **Cape Engano** |
| **Chiyoda** | **Seaplane tender** | **1944** | **30** | **Cape Engano** |
| Zuiho | Submarine tender | 1940 | 30 | Cape Engano |
| Shoho | Submarine tender | 1942 | 30 | Coral Sea |

**Why Both Lost Same Battle:**
- Part of same decoy force
- Both attacked by overwhelming US air power
- Light carriers - unarmored, vulnerable
- Limited AA defenses
- No friendly air cover (aircraft already lost)
- Sitting ducks for US carrier aircraft

**Chiyoda's Tragic Service:**
- Commissioned October 31, 1944
- Sunk October 25, 1944
- **Wait, that's wrong** - departed for battle before formal commissioning
- Actually: Commissioned October 31, departed immediately
- **Sunk 25 days later on first mission**
- Never conducted peacetime operations
- Straight from commissioning to battle to sinking

**Legacy:** Chitose-class represented desperate attempt to replace carrier losses. Converted from seaplane tenders (unusual path). Chitose had 10 months as carrier before sinking. Chiyoda had 25 days. Both sunk at Cape Engano - last carrier battle. Conversions showed Japanese ingenuity but also desperation. By October 1944, carriers without aircraft/pilots were worthless - became decoys. Both ships died as intended - drew US Third Fleet away from Leyte. But sacrifice was in vain. Names: Chitose (1,000 years), Chiyoda (1,000 generations) - ironic given short service as carriers.

**Historical Significance:** Chitose-class showed evolution from seaplane tender to carrier as Japanese needs changed. Quick conversions (especially Chitose - 1 month) demonstrated flexibility. But by 1944, converting carriers was pointless - no pilots, no aircraft, no fuel. Cape Engano was swansong of IJN carrier power. All four carriers sunk (including Zuikaku - last Pearl Harbor carrier). Chitose and Chiyoda died as decoys - tragic end for ships that might have been valuable earlier in war. Represented too little, too late - converted after carrier aviation already lost.
