**Last Survivor** - Hiryu was modified Soryu-class carrier with unique port-side island. Commissioned 1939. Pearl Harbor veteran. Only carrier to survive first Midway dive bomber attack. Launched counterstrikes that fatally damaged USS Yorktown. Last of four carriers sunk at Midway - scuttled June 5, 1942 after surviving longest.

**Key Specs:** 17,300/20,250 tons | 746ft | 34.3 kn | 64-73 aircraft | 12× 127mm DP + 31× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Modified Soryu design with island on port side - unique among IJN carriers (experiment to reduce turbulence). Slightly larger than Soryu (17,300 vs 15,900 tons). Better range (10,330 nm vs 7,680 nm). Survived Midway first attack wave - launched two counterstrikes against US carriers. Sank USS Yorktown (CV-5). Proved effectiveness of port-side island design.

**Design:** Nearly identical to Soryu but larger and with port-side island (opposite of standard). Full-length flight deck. Two hangar decks. High speed (34+ knots). Unarmored like Soryu. Twelve 5-inch DP guns. Better fuel capacity than Soryu. Improved ventilation and fire suppression (still inadequate). Port island experiment worked well - less turbulence on landing approach.

**Construction:**
- Builder: Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
- Laid down: July 8, 1936
- Launched: November 16, 1937
- Commissioned: July 5, 1939
- Cost: 46 million yen

**Service:**
- **1939-1941:** Training, China operations, fleet exercises
- **December 7, 1941:** **Pearl Harbor attack** - Kido Butai second division
- **January-April 1942:** East Indies operations, Indian Ocean raid
- **May 1942:** Missed Coral Sea (escorting Midway troop convoy with Soryu)
- **June 4-5, 1942:** **Battle of Midway** - sunk

**Battle of Midway (June 4-5, 1942):**
*Only carrier to survive first attack and launch counterstrikes*

**Morning (First US Attack - 10:20-10:25 AM):**
- Dive bombers hit Akagi, Kaga, Soryu
- **Hiryu undamaged** - separated from other three carriers
- Only operational IJN carrier remaining

**Hiryu's First Counterstrike (10:40 AM launch):**
- Launched 18 D3A Val dive bombers, 6 A6M Zero fighters
- Attacked USS Yorktown (CV-5)
- **12:20 PM:** 3 bomb hits on Yorktown
- Yorktown stopped, dead in water

**Hiryu's Second Counterstrike (12:45 PM launch):**
- Launched 10 B5N Kate torpedo bombers, 6 A6M Zero fighters
- Attacked USS Yorktown again
- **2:45 PM:** 2 torpedo hits on Yorktown (portside)
- Yorktown abandoned (later sank June 7)

**US Counterstrike on Hiryu (5:00 PM):**
- 24 SBD Dauntless dive bombers from USS Enterprise
- **5:03 PM:** 4 bomb hits on Hiryu
- Bombs penetrated hangar deck
- Massive fires erupted
- All aircraft aboard destroyed
- Fire-fighting efforts failed

**Hiryu's Final Hours:**
- Fires uncontrollable by evening
- Abandoned at 3:15 AM June 5
- Admiral Yamaguchi and Captain Kaku chose to go down with ship
- Scuttled by destroyer torpedoes ~5:10 AM June 5
- Sank at 9:12 AM June 5, 1942
- 392 killed (including admiral and captain), 719 survivors

**Aircraft Complement (1941-1942):**
- 21× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 21× D3A1 Val dive bombers
- 21× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- **Total:** 63 operational + reserves

**Pearl Harbor Attack (Hiryu contribution):**
- **First Wave:** 18 aircraft
  - 9× A6M Zero fighters
  - 9× D3A Val dive bombers
- Attacked Ford Island, Kaneohe Naval Air Station
- All aircraft returned

**Notable Actions:**
- **Pearl Harbor:** Contributed 18 aircraft first wave
- **Darwin Raid (February 19, 1942):** Part of devastating attack on Darwin, Australia
- **Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942):** Attacked Colombo
- **Midway:** Only carrier to survive first attack wave
- **Sank USS Yorktown:** Two strikes crippled US carrier (finished by submarine I-168 June 7)

**Admiral Yamaguchi's Last Stand:**
- Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi commanded Carrier Division 2 (Soryu, Hiryu)
- After Soryu sunk, transferred flag to Hiryu
- Launched both counterstrikes against USS Yorktown
- Refused rescue when Hiryu abandoned
- Last message: "I alone am to blame"
- Went down with ship along with Captain Kaku
- Considered one of IJN's best carrier admirals

**Loss Analysis:**
- Survived longest of four carriers at Midway (~11 hours from first attack)
- Separated position saved Hiryu from first dive bomber attack
- Launched two effective counterstrikes (sank Yorktown)
- Finally located and destroyed by Enterprise dive bombers
- Four bomb hits caused same catastrophic fires as other carriers
- Unarmored design meant rapid destruction
- Admiral and captain chose death with ship - Japanese tradition

**Comparison - Midway Carrier Losses:**
| Carrier | Hits | Time Hit | Abandoned | Sank | Survival Time |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|------|---------------|
| Kaga | 4-5 bombs | 10:22 AM | 4:50 PM | 7:25 PM June 4 | 9 hours |
| Akagi | 3 bombs | 10:22 AM | 4:55 PM | 5:00 AM June 5 | 18.5 hours |
| Soryu | 3 bombs | 10:25 AM | 10:45 AM | 7:13 PM June 4 | 9 hours |
| **Hiryu** | **4 bombs** | **5:03 PM** | **3:15 AM June 5** | **9:12 AM June 5** | **16 hours** |

**Wreck Discovery:**
- Located July 2019 by R/V Petrel
- Depth: 5,400 meters (17,716 feet)
- Located northwest of Midway
- Wreck upright, intact
- Admiral Yamaguchi and Captain Kaku remain with ship

**Legacy:** Hiryu's last stand at Midway was heroic but futile. Only carrier to survive first attack and launch counterstrikes. Sank USS Yorktown - IJN's only carrier kill at Midway. Demonstrated that even damaged carriers could strike back. Admiral Yamaguchi's decision to go down with ship became legendary - symbol of bushido. Port-side island proved successful design (less turbulence). Loss of all four carriers June 4-5, 1942 ended IJN offensive capability. Hiryu surviving longest showed determined fight, but couldn't change outcome. Name means "Flying Dragon."

**Design Legacy:**
- Port-side island validated - reduced turbulence on landing
- Never repeated in IJN (Akagi had port island before rebuild)
- Modern carriers still debate optimal island position
- Unarmored design proved fatal - influenced armored Taiho design
- High speed and large air group prioritized - protection sacrificed

**Historical Significance:** Hiryu embodied "fighting spirit" - only operational carrier after 10:25 AM, launched two strikes, sank enemy carrier, fought to the end. Admiral Yamaguchi's decision to die with ship became symbol of IJN dedication. Midway losses (four carriers in two days) were catastrophic - irreplaceable pilots, experienced crews, and ships lost. Japan never recovered from June 4-5, 1942. Hiryu's resistance prolonged battle but couldn't prevent defeat. Last Pearl Harbor carrier sunk - poetic end to six-carrier strike force that changed history December 7, 1941.
