**Pearl Harbor Carrier** - Kaga was one of six carriers at Pearl Harbor. Converted from Tosa-class battleship after Washington Naval Treaty. 812 ft, 72-90 aircraft. Second-largest air group at Pearl Harbor (29 first wave aircraft). Sunk at Battle of Midway June 4, 1942 - same day as Akagi.

**Key Specs:** 38,200/43,650 tons | 812ft | 27.5 kn | 72-90 aircraft | 10× 200mm + 16× 127mm DP | 280mm belt machinery | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Converted from Tosa-class battleship hull after Washington Naval Treaty cancelled battleship program. One of largest carriers when completed. Originally designed with three-tier flight deck (like Akagi), rebuilt 1934-1935 to single full-length deck. Heavy gun armament for surface action (10× 8-inch). Massive air group. Represented Japan's adaptation to treaty restrictions - converted cancelled battleship to carrier.

**Design:** Full-length flight deck (812 ft). Island on starboard side (moved from port in 1934-1935 rebuild). Two hangar decks. Large air group (up to 90 aircraft). Originally had downward-curved flight deck bow, straightened in rebuild. Eight-inch guns for surface combat. Good protection with battleship-origin armor. Two funnels ducted to starboard.

**Conversion History:**
- Originally ordered as Tosa-class battleship Kaga (1920)
- Laid down July 19, 1920 (Kawasaki Kobe)
- Work suspended by Washington Naval Treaty (1922)
- Converted to aircraft carrier (started November 1923)
  - Originally Amagi-class battlecruiser designated for conversion
  - Amagi damaged in Great Kanto Earthquake (September 1923)
  - Kaga substituted for damaged Amagi
- Launched November 17, 1921 (as battleship hull)
- Converted 1923-1928
- Commissioned March 31, 1928

**Major Rebuild (1934-1935):**
- Three-tier flight deck removed, single full-length deck built
- Island moved from port to starboard
- Flight deck extended forward
- Hangar enlarged
- Armor increased
- AA armament upgraded
- Funnel configuration changed
- Aircraft capacity increased to 90

**Service:**
- **1928-1941:** Training, China operations (1937-1938), fleet exercises
- **December 7, 1941:** **Pearl Harbor attack** - Kido Butai second division
- **January-March 1942:** Rabaul, Ambon, Darwin operations
- **April 1942:** Indian Ocean raid - attacked Colombo (Ceylon)
- **June 4, 1942:** **Battle of Midway** - sunk

**Battle of Midway (June 4, 1942):**
- Part of four-carrier strike force (Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, Soryu)
- Launched attack on Midway Island (morning)
- **10:22 AM:** Hit by 4-5 bombs from SBD Dauntless dive bombers (USS Enterprise VB-6)
- Bombs struck hangar decks with armed/fueled aircraft
- Massive fires and explosions
- All fire-fighting efforts failed
- Abandoned at 4:50 PM
- Torpedoed by destroyers (scuttling) ~7:25 PM
- Two massive explosions, sank at 7:25 PM June 4, 1942
- 811 killed (including air group), 1,205 survivors

**Aircraft Complement (December 1941):**
- 30× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 30× D3A1 Val dive bombers
- 30× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- **Total:** 90 aircraft (includes reserves)

**Pearl Harbor Attack (Kaga contribution):**
- **First Wave:** 29 aircraft
  - 9× A6M Zero fighters
  - 14× D3A Val dive bombers
  - 6× B5N Kate level bombers
- Attacked Ford Island, Hickam Field, battleship row
- All aircraft returned safely

**Notable Actions:**
- **Pearl Harbor:** Second-largest air group contribution (29 aircraft first wave)
- **Darwin Raid (February 19, 1942):** 54 aircraft from Kaga attacked Darwin, Australia
- **Indian Ocean Raid (April 1942):** Attacked Colombo with combined air group
- **Midway:** Catastrophic loss from dive bomber attack

**Loss Analysis:**
- Hit by 4-5 bombs in ~2 minutes
- Bombs penetrated hangar decks
- Aircraft being rearmed/refueled for second wave
- Aviation fuel and ordnance caused catastrophic fires
- Fire-fighting hampered by damage to water mains
- Eventually reached magazines
- Fatal design flaw: inadequate compartmentalization and fire suppression

**Wreck Discovery:**
- Located October 18, 2019 by R/V Petrel
- Depth: 5,400 meters (17,716 feet)
- Located ~900 miles northwest of Midway
- Wreck sitting upright, largely intact
- Clear evidence of battle damage and fire

**Legacy:** Kaga's career symbolized IJN's carrier power 1941-1942. Pearl Harbor contribution was second-largest of six carriers. Indian Ocean raid showed range and striking power of carrier aviation. Midway loss (along with Akagi, Soryu) crippled IJN carrier force irreparably. Four carriers lost in single day June 4, 1942 - worst carrier loss in naval history. Demonstrated vulnerability of carriers to dive bomber attack. Name means "increased joy" - ironic given fate. Wreck discovery (2019) renewed historical interest.

**Historical Significance:** Kaga represented Japan's adaptation to Washington Naval Treaty - converted battleship became powerful carrier. Pearl Harbor attack showed effectiveness of carrier aviation. Loss at Midway was turning point of Pacific War. Four-carrier loss June 4, 1942 ended Japanese offensive capability. Demonstrated that carriers, despite striking power, were vulnerable to air attack. Inadequate damage control and fire suppression proved fatal - lessons learned by US Navy after Coral Sea (USS Yorktown repaired in 48 hours). Kaga's destruction marked end of IJN carrier dominance.
