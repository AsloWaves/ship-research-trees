**German Conversion** - Shinyo was an escort carrier converted from German luxury liner Scharnhorst. 1 ship commissioned December 1943. 33 aircraft, 22 knots. Largest Japanese escort carrier. Used for aircraft transport and training. Sunk November 17, 1944 by submarine USS Spadefish (Yellow Sea) - shortest service life of any Japanese carrier (11 months). Over 1,100 killed. Only German-built ship used as Japanese carrier.

**Key Specs:** 17,500/20,586 tons | 630ft | 22 kn | 33 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 30-42× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 1 ship

**Innovation:** Unique conversion from German luxury liner. Originally German ship Scharnhorst (named for battleship, built 1935). Caught in Japan when war began. Seized and converted to escort carrier 1942-1943. Largest Japanese escort carrier (20,586 tons full load). Diesel engines (22 knots). 33 aircraft capacity (larger than other escorts). Used for aircraft ferry and training missions. Shortest service life of any Japanese carrier - 11 months (commissioned December 1943, sunk November 1944). Torpedoed by USS Spadefish with 1,000+ troops aboard - worst single-ship casualty for IJN escort carriers.

**Design:** Converted from luxury liner. Full-length flight deck (630 ft). Single hangar. Island starboard. Two elevators. Diesel engines from liner (22 knots). Eight 5-inch DP guns. Moderate light AA (30-42× 25mm). Unarmored conversion. 33 aircraft capacity - best for Japanese escort carriers. Good range (8,000 nm) from liner design. Larger than Taiyo-class, slightly faster (22 vs 21 knots). But still too slow and vulnerable.

**Ship:**
- **Shinyo** (originally German liner Scharnhorst) - Sunk November 17, 1944 (submarine USS Spadefish, Yellow Sea), 1,130 killed

**Construction:**
- **Builder:** Bremer Vulkan, Bremen, Germany (as liner, 1935)
- **Original Name:** Scharnhorst (German passenger liner)
- **Built:** 1935 (as luxury liner)
- **Seized by Japan:** 1942 (caught in Japan when war began)
- **Conversion begun:** 1942
- **Launched as carrier:** September 22, 1943
- **Commissioned:** December 15, 1943

**Original Ship - Scharnhorst (Liner):**
- German luxury liner NYK Line charter
- Japan-Europe route
- Modern liner (built 1935)
- Caught in Japan when Germany and Japan became co-belligerents
- Japan seized ship 1942
- Too valuable to waste - converted to carrier

**Carrier Service (December 1943-November 1944):**

**December 1943-March 1944: Work-up:**
- Training off Japan
- Aircraft handling practice
- Crew familiarization
- Testing systems

**April-October 1944: Ferry Missions:**
- Transported aircraft to:
  - Philippines
  - Formosa
  - Mainland bases
- Carried crated and operational aircraft
- Avoided combat operations
- Training missions (carrier landing practice)

**November 1944: Final Mission:**
- Transporting troops and aircraft
- Korea to mainland Japan route
- Carrying supplies, personnel
- Heavy load (1,000+ troops aboard)

**November 17, 1944 - Sinking:**
*USS Spadefish Attack*

**Background:**
- Shinyo transiting Yellow Sea
- Loaded with troops and cargo
- **USS Spadefish (SS-411)** on patrol
- Area known for Japanese shipping

**November 17, 1944 (Evening):**
**Detection:**
- USS Spadefish radar detected Shinyo
- Large ship, valuable target
- Approached for attack

**Attack:**
- **USS Spadefish fired spread of 4 torpedoes**
- **At least two torpedoes hit Shinyo** amidships
- Massive explosions
- Torpedo hits ruptured fuel tanks
- Aviation fuel ignited

**Fatal Cascade:**
- Diesel fuel and aviation fuel fires
- Explosions throughout ship
- Troops trapped below decks
- Ship loaded beyond capacity
- Inadequate lifeboats for actual passengers

**Sinking:**
- **Fires spread rapidly**
- **Flooding uncontrollable**
- **Capsized within 4 hours**
- **1,130 killed** (including ~1,000 troops)
- ~80-100 survivors (mainly crew)
- **Worst single-ship casualties for IJN escort carriers**

**Why Such High Casualties:**
1. **Overloaded:** 1,000+ troops (beyond capacity)
2. **Rapid fire spread:** Fuel fires throughout
3. **Night sinking:** Darkness hindered rescue
4. **Few escorts:** Limited rescue capability
5. **Winter:** Cold water (Yellow Sea, November)
6. **Distance:** Far from land

**Comparison - Escort Carrier Losses:**
| Carrier | Sunk By | Date | Casualties | Service Length |
|---------|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| **Shinyo** | **Submarine** | **Nov 1944** | **1,130** | **11 months** |
| Taiyo | Submarine | Aug 1944 | 747 | 34 months |
| Unyo | Submarine | Sep 1944 | 1,238 | 28 months |
| Chuyo | Submarine | Dec 1943 | 1,268 | 13 months |

**Shinyo: Shortest service (11 months), second-highest casualties**

**USS Spadefish (SS-411):**
*The Attacker*

**Background:**
- Balao-class submarine
- Commissioned March 1944
- Aggressive commander (Lt. Cmdr. Underwood)

**Shinyo Kill:**
- First major kill for Spadefish
- Largest ship sunk by Spadefish
- Carrier kill credited

**Later Service:**
- Continued successful patrols
- Multiple merchant ships sunk
- Survived war
- Decommissioned 1963

**Why Shinyo Vulnerable:**
**Conversion Limitations:**
1. **Unarmored:** No torpedo protection
2. **Merchant hull:** Not designed for combat damage
3. **Slow:** 22 knots - couldn't outrun submarines
4. **Diesel fuel:** Flammable
5. **Aviation fuel:** Carried for aircraft - volatile
6. **Poor damage control:** Merchant-trained crew

**Submarine Threat (1944):**
- US submarines dominant
- Radar-equipped
- Wolf pack tactics
- Aggressive commanders
- No safe Japanese waters

**Aircraft Complement (typical):**

**Ferry Mission:**
- 30+ crated aircraft in hangar/deck
- Minimal operational aircraft (self-defense)
- Aviation fuel and supplies
- Spare parts
- Ground crew

**Training Mission:**
- 20-25 operational aircraft:
  - A6M Zero fighters
  - D4Y Judy dive bombers
  - Mix for carrier landing training

**Why Only 11 Months Service:**

**Commissioned:** December 15, 1943
**Sunk:** November 17, 1944
**Service:** 11 months total

**Reasons:**
1. **Late conversion:** Work began 1942, completed late 1943
2. **Limited use:** Ferry and training only
3. **Submarine threat:** Avoiding exposure
4. **Bad luck:** USS Spadefish found her

**If Avoided Submarine:**
- Likely would have survived to surrender (like Kaiyo)
- Or sunk in harbor raid (like many)
- But 11 months actual service

**Comparison - Japanese Escort Carriers:**
| Carrier | Original | Converted | Service | Fate | Casualties |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|------|------------|
| **Shinyo** | **German liner** | **1942-43** | **11 mo** | **Submarine** | **1,130** |
| Taiyo | Japanese liner | 1940-41 | 34 mo | Submarine | 747 |
| Kaiyo | Japanese liner | 1942-43 | 21 mo | **Survived** | 0 |

**Shinyo: Shortest service, highest casualties (with troops)**

**German Connection:**
**Original Ship:**
- Built Germany (Bremer Vulkan) 1935
- Named after German battleship Scharnhorst
- Luxury liner for Europe-Asia route
- Chartered to NYK Line (Japanese)
- Caught in Japan when war began (1939-1941)

**Significance:**
- Only German-built carrier in Japanese service
- German engineering (liner)
- Japanese conversion (carrier)
- Unique international hybrid

**Legacy:** Shinyo represented unique conversion - German luxury liner seized and converted to Japanese escort carrier. Commissioned December 1943. Used for aircraft ferry and training. Torpedoed November 1944 by USS Spadefish (Yellow Sea) with 1,000+ troops aboard - 1,130 killed, worst single-ship loss for Japanese escort carriers. Only 11 months service - shortest of any Japanese carrier. Showed vulnerability of escort carriers to submarines. Largest Japanese escort carrier (20,586 tons) but still too slow (22 knots), too vulnerable. Only German-built ship used as Japanese carrier. Name: Shinyo (Divine Hawk).

**Historical Significance:** Shinyo epitomized escort carrier vulnerability. German luxury liner seized 1942, converted to carrier, commissioned December 1943. Only 11 months later (November 1944), torpedoed by USS Spadefish. Over 1,000 troops aboard (overloaded) - 1,130 killed total. Worst Japanese escort carrier casualties. Showed that by 1944, no safe waters - Yellow Sea (near Japan/Korea) still deadly. USS Spadefish's radar detected Shinyo, attack followed, fires spread, ship capsized. Shortest service life of any Japanese carrier. Represents tragic waste - 1,935 luxury liner became 1943 carrier became 1944 tomb for 1,130 men. German engineering, Japanese conversion, American torpedoes - international tragedy. All four Taiyo-class lost to submarines (1943-1944), Shinyo lost to submarine (1944) - only Kaiyo survived (speed and luck). Showed escort carriers fatal weakness against submarine threat.
