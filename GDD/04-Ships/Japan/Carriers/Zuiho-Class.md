**Submarine Tender Conversions** - Zuiho-class were light carriers converted from submarine tenders. 2 ships (Zuiho, Shoho). Single hangar design (learned from Ryujo). Shoho sunk at Coral Sea May 7, 1942 - first IJN carrier lost in WWII. Zuiho survived Santa Cruz, Philippine Sea, sunk at Cape Engano October 25, 1944.

**Key Specs:** 11,262/14,200 tons | 668ft | 28 kn | 30 aircraft | 8× 127mm DP + 30-68× 25mm AA | Unarmored | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Converted from submarine tenders (Tsurugizaki, Takasaki) - unique conversion path. Single-hangar design corrected Ryujo's stability problems. Diesel-electric propulsion from tender design. Good range (9,000 nm). Proved viability of light carrier conversions. Shoho first IJN carrier sunk in WWII (Coral Sea) - marked beginning of carrier losses. Zuiho combat longevity (1942-1944) showed well-designed light carriers could survive multiple battles.

**Design:** Converted from submarine tenders during construction. Single hangar deck (stable design). Flight deck 668 ft. Small island starboard. Eight 5-inch DP guns. Originally diesel-electric propulsion (submarine tender design), later turbines. Good range from tender heritage. Light structure, no armor. Elevator forward and aft. Adequate speed (28 knots) for fleet operations.

**Ships:**
- **Shoho** - Sunk May 7, 1942 (Battle of Coral Sea), 631 killed (204 survivors)
- **Zuiho** - Sunk October 25, 1944 (Battle of Cape Engano), 215 killed (843 survivors)

- Hit by at least **13 bombs and 7 torpedoes** in ~10 minutes
- Flight deck wrecked, massive fires
- **11:35 AM:** Capsized and sank
- Fastest carrier sinking in WWII (10 minutes from first hit to sinking)
- **631 killed, 204 survivors**
- US radio call: **"Scratch one flattop!"** (famous quote)

**Service - Zuiho (1940-1944):**

**Battle of Santa Cruz - Zuiho (October 26, 1942):**
- Part of carrier strike force (Shokaku, Zuikaku, Zuiho, Junyo)
- **7:40 AM:** Hit by single 1,000-lb bomb from USS Enterprise SBD

**Battle of Philippine Sea - Zuiho (June 19-20, 1944):**
- Part of "Mobile Fleet" (9 carriers)
- Launched strikes against US Task Force 58
- **"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"** - Japanese aircraft massacred
- Zuiho survived battle undamaged
- Lost most aircraft but ship intact

**Battle of Cape Engano - Zuiho (October 25, 1944):**
*Last major carrier battle*

**Background:**
- Part of Admiral Ozawa's Northern Force (4 carriers)
- Mission: Decoy force to lure US carriers away from Leyte Gulf
- Carriers had only ~100 aircraft total (severe pilot/aircraft shortage)

**The Battle:**
- **October 25, 1944:** Attacked by massive US carrier strikes
- Waves of Hellcat fighters, Helldiver dive bombers, Avenger torpedo bombers
- **1:10 PM:** First hits on Zuiho
- Multiple bomb and rocket hits over several hours
- Flight deck destroyed, fires spreading
- **3:26 PM:** Capsized and sank
- **215 killed, 843 survivors**

**Aircraft Complement (1942):**
- 12× A6M2 Zero fighters
- 12× B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers
- 6× spare aircraft
- **Total:** 30 aircraft

**Comparison - Zuiho-Class Fates:**
| Ship | Commissioned | Battle | Date | Survival Time | Casualties |
|------|--------------|--------|------|---------------|------------|
| Shoho | Jan 1942 | Coral Sea | May 7, 1942 | 10 minutes | 631 of 835 |
| Zuiho | Dec 1940 | Cape Engano | Oct 25, 1944 | ~2 hours | 215 of 1,058 |

**Shoho Loss Analysis:**
- First IJN carrier sunk in WWII
- Overwhelmed by massive strike (93 aircraft)
- 13 bombs + 7 torpedoes in 10 minutes
- Fastest carrier sinking - inadequate damage control
- Unarmored light carrier couldn't survive concentrated attack
- "Scratch one flattop!" became famous quote
- Demonstrated vulnerability of light carriers

**Zuiho Combat Record:**
- Survived Santa Cruz (1942) - bomb damage
- Survived Philippine Sea (1944) - ship undamaged but aircraft lost
- Sunk at Cape Engano (1944) - after 2 years combat
- Longest-serving Zuiho-class carrier
- Demonstrated well-designed light carriers could survive multiple battles

**Submarine Tender Heritage:**
- Originally designed as submarine tenders (Tsurugizaki, Takasaki)
- Diesel-electric propulsion from tender design
- Good range (9,000 nm) - inherited from tender requirements
- Conversion to carriers during construction
- Showed versatility of naval architecture

**Legacy:** Shoho's loss at Coral Sea (May 7, 1942) was first IJN carrier sunk in WWII - marked beginning of carrier attrition. "Scratch one flattop!" radio call became iconic. Zuiho's survival through multiple battles (Santa Cruz, Philippine Sea) before Cape Engano demonstrated well-designed light carriers could be resilient. Both ships proved single-hangar light carrier design viable (learned from Ryujo). Submarine tender conversion unique in IJN. Cape Engano was last major carrier battle - Zuiho among last IJN carriers sunk in fleet action. Names: "Zuiho" (Auspicious Phoenix), "Shoho" (Auspicious Phoenix) - similar names, different fates.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Single hangar for stability (corrected Ryujo problems)
- Light carrier role: fleet support, not main strike force
- Conversion from tenders showed resource efficiency
- Good range for extended operations
- No armor - speed and aircraft capacity prioritized
- Adequate speed (28 knots) for fleet operations

**Historical Significance:** Shoho was first IJN carrier lost in combat - psychological shock to IJN. Coral Sea battle (first carrier vs carrier) showed new warfare era. Zuiho's longevity showed good design - survived two major battles before Cape Engano. Both ships exemplified light carrier role - flexible support vessels that freed fleet carriers for primary missions. Cape Engano was end of IJN carrier power - Zuiho among last carriers with trained crews. Conversion from submarine tenders showed IJN adaptability and resource constraints.
