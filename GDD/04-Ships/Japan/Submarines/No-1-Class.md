**First Japanese Submarines** - No. 1-Class were Japan's first submarines. 5 boats commissioned 1905. American Holland design built under license in Japan. Tiny (57 tons surface - smallest submarines ever operated). Gasoline engine surface, electric submerged. 7 knots surface, 5 knots submerged. One 18-inch torpedo tube, 3 torpedoes carried. All 5 served WWI (1914-1918) in coastal defense. All scrapped 1920 after 15 years service. Primitive but functional - proved Japan could operate submersibles. Founded submarine tradition that led to I-400 (5,223 tons - 92× larger) 40 years later.

**Key Specs:** 57/63 tons | 67ft | 7/5 kn | 1× 450mm torpedo tube | 3 torpedoes | 50ft test depth | Gasoline/electric | 5 boats

**Innovation:** Japan's first submarines (1905). Holland design (John Philip Holland, American inventor). Built in Japan under license - technology transfer. Incredibly tiny (57 tons surface, 63 tons submerged - smaller than many surface torpedo boats). Single-hull design. Gasoline engine for surface (dangerous - fumes explosive). Electric motor submerged. Crew only 5 men (cramped). One bow torpedo tube. Three torpedoes total (2 reloads). 50-foot test depth (very shallow by later standards). 7 knots surface, 5 knots submerged (slow). 160 nm range (coastal only). All 5 commissioned 1905 just after Russo-Japanese War ended. All 5 served WWI in harbor/coastal defense. All scrapped 1920 when obsolete. Critical achievement: Proved Japan could operate submersible technology - foundation for future submarine force.

**Design:** Tiny single-hull submarine (67 ft long - about size of large yacht). Surface displacement 57 tons, submerged 63 tons. One 18-inch torpedo tube in bow. Carried 3 torpedoes total (1 loaded, 2 reloads). No deck gun (too small). Gasoline engine for surface propulsion (150 shp, dangerous fumes). Electric motor for submerged (70 shp, battery-powered). Single shaft. 7 knots surface, 5 knots submerged (very slow). Test depth 50 feet (shallow - pressure hull weak). Crew 5 (commander, 4 sailors - cramped conditions). Range 160 nm surface (coastal defense only). Holland design: Teardrop-like hull, diving planes, periscope. Primitive but functional 1905 technology.

**Boats (5 built - all scrapped):**

**All scrapped 1920:**
1. **No. 1** - Commissioned September 28, 1905, scrapped 1920
2. **No. 2** - Commissioned September 28, 1905, scrapped 1920
3. **No. 3** - Commissioned September 28, 1905, scrapped 1920
4. **No. 4** - Commissioned September 28, 1905, scrapped 1920
5. **No. 5** - Commissioned September 28, 1905, scrapped 1920

**Construction:**

**All five boats:**
- **Design:** Holland Type VII (American design)
- **Builder:** Kawasaki Shipyard, Kobe, Japan (license-built)
- **Laid down:** 1904
- **Launched:** 1904-1905
- **Commissioned:** All September 28, 1905 (same day!)
- **Cost:** Built under license from Electric Boat Company (USA)

**Service History:**

**Early Service (1905-1914):**
- Training
- Experimenting with submarine operations
- Crew training
- Harbor defense exercises
- Developing submarine doctrine
- Very limited operational use (too primitive)

**WWI (1914-1918):**
- Harbor defense
- Coastal patrol
- Training
- No combat (too small, too slow)
- Pacific quiet anyway (Germany defeated quickly)
- Served more as training boats than combat vessels

**Post-WWI (1918-1920):**
- Reserve status
- Completely obsolete
- Japan building much larger submarines (Kaidai types)
- **All 5 scrapped 1920**
- 15 years service (adequate for experimental boats)

**Holland Design:**

**John Philip Holland:**
- Irish-American inventor
- Pioneered practical submarine design
- Electric Boat Company founder
- Holland Type submarines sold to:
  - US Navy
  - Royal Navy (British)
  - Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN)
  - Others

**Design Features:**
- Single hull (no separate ballast tanks outside pressure hull)
- Gasoline engine surface (dangerous but compact)
- Electric motor submerged (battery-powered)
- Bow torpedo tube
- Diving planes fore and aft
- Periscope
- Small size (coastal defense)

**Why Gasoline (Dangerous):**

**Early Technology:**
- Gasoline engines: Available, compact, powerful
- Diesel engines: New technology (1890s), not yet reliable for submarines
- Steam engines: Too large, too complex

**Danger:**
- Gasoline fumes highly explosive
- Poor ventilation in submarine
- Risk of explosion
- Several navies lost boats to gasoline explosions

**Later Evolution:**
- 1910s: Diesel engines replaced gasoline (safer, more efficient)
- All later submarines: Diesel/electric
- Gasoline submarines: 1900-1910 only

**57 Tons - Smallest Submarines:**

**Incredibly Small:**
- No. 1-Class: 57 tons surface
- Later I-400: 5,223 tons surface (92× larger!)
- Modern nuclear submarines: 8,000-18,000 tons

**Comparison:**
- Large yacht: ~50-100 tons
- **No. 1-Class: 57 tons** (yacht-sized!)
- Torpedo boat: 200-400 tons
- Destroyer: 1,000-2,000 tons

**Limitations of Size:**
- Crew only 5 (minimal operation)
- 3 torpedoes total (very limited armament)
- 160 nm range (coastal only)
- 50 ft test depth (very shallow)
- 7/5 knots (very slow)
- Rough seas dangerous (small hull)

**Why So Small:**
- First generation - experimental
- Technology limited
- Coastal defense mission (didn't need larger)
- Proof of concept

**Crew of 5:**

**Minimal Manning:**
1. **Commander** (captain, navigator, periscope operator)
2. **Engineer** (gasoline engine, electric motor, batteries)
3. **Torpedoman** (torpedo tube, reloading)
4. **Helmsman** (diving planes, steering)
5. **Sailor** (lookout, general duties)

**Conditions:**
- Extremely cramped (67 ft long, 6 ft beam)
- Hot (gasoline engine heat, no AC)
- Dangerous (fumes, shallow depth, weak hull)
- Short patrols only (limited endurance)
- Primitive facilities (no bunks, minimal food/water)

**Why All Scrapped 1920:**

**Obsolescence:**
1. **Age:** 15 years old
2. **Size:** 57 tons (newer submarines 1,000+ tons)
3. **Technology:** Gasoline engines (all modern boats diesel)
4. **Depth:** 50 feet (newer boats 200+ feet)
5. **Speed:** 7/5 knots (newer boats 14/8 knots)
6. **Armament:** 3 torpedoes (newer boats 12-20 torpedoes)
7. **No value:** Too primitive even for training

**Decision:**
- Scrap all 5 together (1920)
- Focus on modern submarines
- Historical value only

**Comparison - First Submarines:**
| Class | Nation | Year | Tons | Type | Speed (surf/sub) | Service | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|------|------|------------------|---------|------|
| **No. 1 (Japan)** | **Japan** | **1905** | **57** | **Holland** | **7/5 kn** | **15 yrs** | **Scrapped 1920** |
| Holland (USA) | USA | 1900 | 64 | Holland | 7/5 kn | 10 yrs | Scrapped 1910s |
| A-Class (UK) | Britain | 1903 | 190 | Holland | 9/6 kn | 10-15 yrs | Scrapped 1910s-1920s |

**Japan's No. 1-Class: Similar to other early Holland boats - small, experimental, short service**

**15-Year Service:**

**Adequate for Experimental Type:**
- Typical early submarines: 10-20 years
- **No. 1-Class: 15 years** (average)
- Served purpose: Training, experimentation, proving concept

**Not Combat Effectiveness:**
- Too small for combat (57 tons)
- Too slow (7/5 knots)
- Too limited (3 torpedoes, 160 nm range)
- But: Trained crews, developed doctrine, proved technology

**Value:**
- By 1920: Japan had trained hundreds of submarine sailors
- Developed submarine tactics
- Built infrastructure (bases, training schools)
- **Ready to operate larger, more capable boats**

**Evolution - Japan Submarine Development:**

**1905: No. 1-Class**
- 57 tons
- 7/5 knots
- 3 torpedoes
- 50 ft depth
- Gasoline/electric
- Experimental

**1920s: Kaidai Type (I-121, etc.)**
- 1,400-1,800 tons (25-30× larger)
- 17/8 knots
- 12-16 torpedoes
- 200 ft depth
- Diesel/electric
- Ocean-going

**1940s: I-400-Class**
- 5,223 tons (92× larger than No. 1!)
- 18.7/6.5 knots
- 8 torpedoes + 3 aircraft
- 330 ft depth
- Diesel/electric
- Largest submarines in world

**40 years: 57 tons → 5,223 tons = Revolution**

**Legacy:** No. 1-Class represented Japan's first submarines. Five tiny Holland-type boats (57 tons) commissioned September 1905 immediately after Russo-Japanese War. American design built under license in Japan - technology transfer, learning phase. Gasoline engine surface (dangerous), electric motor submerged. 7/5 knots, 50-foot depth, 3 torpedoes total. All 5 served WWI in coastal defense. All scrapped 1920 after 15 years when obsolete. Primitive but functional - proved Japan could operate submersible technology. Foundation for future submarine force: No. 1 (1905, 57 tons, experimental) → 40 years → I-400 (1944, 5,223 tons, largest in world). From student to master. Without learning with No. 1-Class, Japan couldn't have built advanced fleet submarines.

**Historical Significance:** No. 1-Class marked Japan's entry into submarine warfare. Commissioned 1905 just months after Battle of Tsushima (May 1905) - Japan's decisive naval victory over Russia proved surface fleet capability, submarines added underwater dimension. Technology transfer: American Holland design, built in Japan, trained Japanese crews. Five tiny boats (57 tons - yacht-sized) launched same day (September 28, 1905). All survived 15 years - no losses, trained hundreds of sailors, developed doctrine. By time scrapped (1920), Japan operating much larger boats and planning fleet submarines. Evolution visible: No. 1 (1905, gasoline, experimental, 57 tons, 3 torpedoes) → I-400 (1944, diesel, operational, 5,223 tons, 8 torpedoes + 3 aircraft). 40 years transformation. No. 1-Class: Humble beginning, enormous consequence. First tiny steps underwater led to world's largest submarines. Foundation stones.
