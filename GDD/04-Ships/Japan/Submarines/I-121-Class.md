**Interwar Fleet Boats** - I-121-class were early Japanese fleet submarines. 3 boats commissioned 1927. Medium-sized (1,390/1,768 tons), six torpedo tubes + 12 torpedoes. 17.3 knots surfaced. Kaidai (fleet submarine) type - designed for fleet scouting and attack. Two lost in combat (I-121, I-122). One (I-123) became training sub, scrapped 1945. Represented 1920s Japanese submarine development - learning fleet submarine operations before larger designs.

**Key Specs:** 1,390/1,768 tons | 278ft | 17.3/8 kn | 6× 533mm tubes (12 torpedoes) | 10,000 nm range | 3 boats

**Innovation:** Early Kaidai (fleet submarine) type development. Commissioned 1927 during interwar naval expansion. Medium size (1,390 tons surfaced). Six torpedo tubes, twelve torpedoes. 120mm deck gun. 17.3 knots surfaced (adequate for era). 10,000 nm range (good for Pacific). Represented Japanese learning curve - developing fleet submarine doctrine after WWI. Two saw combat WWII (I-121, I-122 both lost). One relegated to training (I-123, survived war). Showed evolution from WWI coastal subs to modern fleet boats. Technology base for later larger designs (I-15, I-400 classes).

**Design:** Medium fleet submarine hull (278 ft, 1,390 tons). Six torpedo tubes (four bow, two stern). Twelve Type 89 torpedoes. Single 120mm (4.7-inch) deck gun forward. One 13mm AA gun. Diesel-electric propulsion. Two shafts. 17.3 knots surfaced, 8 knots submerged. Good range (10,000 nm at 10 knots). Crew 60. Kaidai type layout - fleet operations priority. Adequate for 1927 but obsolete by WWII standards (slow, lightly armed vs later boats).

**Boats (3 built):**

**Lost in combat (2):**
1. **I-121** - Sunk April 3, 1945 (aircraft, near Okinawa), all hands lost
2. **I-122** - Sunk June 10, 1945 (aircraft/surface ships, near Okinawa), all hands lost

**Scrapped (1):**
3. **I-123** - Relegated to training submarine 1941, scrapped 1945

**Construction:**
- Builder: Kure Naval Arsenal
- Commissioned: 1927
- Interwar naval expansion program

**Service History:**

**Pre-War (1927-1941):**
- Fleet exercises
- Submarine tactics development
- China operations (1930s)
- Training missions
- By 1941: 14 years old (approaching obsolescence)

**I-123 (Training Submarine):**
- **1941:** Relegated to training submarine
- Too old for frontline combat
- Used to train submarine crews
- Based in Japan
- **Survived war, scrapped 1945**
- Only I-121-class survivor

**I-121 and I-122 (Combat Service WWII):**

**1941-1945:**
- Both kept in combat service despite age
- Pacific patrols
- Convoy attacks attempted
- Limited success (old, slow, poorly armed vs modern ASW)

**I-121 (1927-1945):**

**1941-1944:**
- Multiple war patrols
- Few successes
- 18 years old by 1945

**April 3, 1945:**
- Off Okinawa (Okinawa campaign)
- Detected by Allied aircraft
- **Air attack** (bombs/rockets)
- **Sunk with all hands** (~60 killed)
- 18 years service

**I-122 (1927-1945):**

**1941-1945:**
- War patrols
- Limited effectiveness (old submarine)

**June 10, 1945:**
- Near Okinawa
- Detected by Allied aircraft and surface ships
- Combined attack
- **Sunk with all hands** (~60 killed)
- Two months before surrender
- 18 years service

**Kaidai Type Submarines:**

**"Kaidai" Meaning:**
- Kai = Fleet
- Dai = Large
- **Kaidai = Fleet Submarine**

**Concept:**
- Operate with battlefleet
- Scout for enemy
- Attack enemy fleet
- Long range (Pacific operations)
- Good surface speed (keep up with fleet)

**I-121-Class:**
- Early Kaidai type (KD3a)
- Experimental (learning design)
- Later Kaidai types larger, faster, better armed
- But: Established fleet submarine doctrine

**Why Two Lost at Okinawa (1945):**

**Desperate Situation:**
1. **Okinawa campaign:** Critical battle (April-June 1945)
2. **All submarines needed:** Even old boats
3. **18 years old:** I-121 and I-122 ancient by 1945
4. **Allied ASW:** Overwhelming by 1945
5. **Slow submarines:** Easy targets

**Result:**
- Both lost within 2 months
- Combined age: 36 years service
- Both died trying to defend Okinawa

**Comparison - 1920s Submarines:**
| Class | Nation | Year | Tons | Tubes | WWII Service | Fate |
|-------|--------|------|------|-------|--------------|------|
| **I-121** | **Japan** | **1927** | **1,390** | **6** | **2 lost, 1 training** | **67% loss** |
| S-class | USA | 1920s | 850 | 4 | Some combat | Most survived |
| O-class | UK | 1920s | 1,350 | 8 | Limited | Mixed |

**I-121: Old boats kept in combat, high losses**

**18-Year Service (I-121, I-122):**

**Exceptional for Submarines:**
- Typical submarine service: 10-15 years
- **I-121/I-122: 18 years** (1927-1945)
- Kept in service due to submarine shortage
- Obsolete but better than nothing
- Both died in service (not scrapped)

**Why I-123 Survived:**

**Training Role:**
1. **1941:** Too old for combat (14 years)
2. **Training mission:** Teach submarine crews
3. **Based in Japan:** Safe waters
4. **Not risked:** Valuable for training
5. **War ended:** Before worn out

**Result:**
- Only I-121-class to survive war
- Scrapped 1945 (18 years old, worn out)
- Honorable retirement vs combat death

**Legacy:** I-121-class represented early Japanese fleet submarine development. Three boats (1927) - Kaidai type learning process. Six torpedoes, 17.3 knots, 10,000 nm range. I-123 relegated to training 1941 (too old), survived war. I-121 and I-122 kept in combat despite age - both lost at Okinawa 1945 (18 years old). Showed Japanese submarine shortage - using 18-year-old boats in 1945 combat. Technology base for later improved designs. 67% loss rate (2 of 3). Names: I-121, I-122, I-123 (number designations).

**Historical Significance:** I-121-class showed Japanese submarine evolution and desperation. Commissioned 1927 - interwar development, learning fleet submarine operations. By 1941 (14 years old) already obsolete - I-123 relegated to training (wise decision, survived). But I-121 and I-122 kept in combat (submarine shortage). Both lost at Okinawa 1945 at age 18 - shows desperation, using ancient submarines because nothing else available. Compare to USA: Scrapped old S-class submarines, built modern Gato/Balao classes. Japan: Used 18-year-old submarines in 1945 combat. I-121/I-122 deaths at Okinawa (April and June 1945) symbolic - old boats from 1927 dying in last campaign of war. Showed Japanese submarine force depletion - from modern fleet to using museum pieces. I-123 survival (training role) showed wisdom of preserving older ships for training vs wasting in futile combat.
