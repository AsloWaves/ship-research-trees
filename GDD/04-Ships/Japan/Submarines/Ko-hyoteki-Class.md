**Two-Man Submarines** - Ko-hyoteki-class were midget submarines with 2-man crew. ~50 built 1938-1945. 78.5 feet long, 46 tons. Two external torpedoes. Carried by mother submarines to target areas. Used at Pearl Harbor (5 boats, all lost), Sydney Harbor, Diego Suarez, Guadalcanal. Essentially suicide weapons - few returned. First American killed at Pearl Harbor was from Ko-hyoteki torpedo.

**Key Specs:** 46/47 tons | 78.5ft | 23/19 kn | 2× 450mm external torpedoes | 2-man crew | ~50 boats

**Innovation:** First operational Japanese midget submarines. Battery-powered only (no diesel). Carried by mother submarines (I-class) to attack zones. Two external torpedoes - detachable from bow. Essentially suicide craft - limited range (100 nm), no realistic recovery. Used in special attacks: Pearl Harbor, Sydney Harbor, Madagascar. Most famous for Pearl Harbor attack (5 boats, all lost, zero confirmed kills). Showed Japanese willingness to sacrifice crews for surprise attacks.

**Design:** Tiny submarine (78.5 ft long). Two-man crew (pilot, navigator). Battery-powered electric motor. Single shaft. Two 450mm torpedoes externally mounted on bow rails. Could be dropped individually. Periscope. No deck gun. No communications beyond short range. Pressure hull for ~100 feet depth. Designed for one-way missions - limited fuel, no recovery plan.

**Deployment Method:**
- Carried on deck of mother submarine (I-class)
- Released near target area
- Midget submarine penetrates harbor/defenses
- Fires torpedoes at anchored ships
- Crew attempts escape (rarely successful)
- Mother submarine retrieves survivors (rarely happened)

**Pearl Harbor Attack (December 7, 1941):**
*Five Ko-hyoteki participated - all lost*

**Background:**
- Special Attack Unit (5 midget subs)
- Launched from mother subs outside Pearl Harbor
- Mission: Penetrate harbor, torpedo battleships
- Crews considered it one-way mission

**The Five Boats:**
1. **Ha-16:** Ran aground outside harbor, captured intact (Ensign Sakamaki captured - first US POW)
2. **Ha-19:** Depth charged and sunk by USS Ward (3:57 AM - first shots of Pacific War)
3. **Ha-20:** Sank in harbor entrance, depth charged by USS Monaghan
4. **Ha-21:** Fate uncertain, likely sank outside harbor
5. **Ha-22:** Fired torpedoes in harbor (one hit USS Oklahoma or USS West Virginia, disputed), sunk by depth charges

**Results:**
- **All 5 boats lost**
- **9 crew killed, 1 captured** (Ensign Sakamaki)
- **Zero confirmed ship kills** (some dispute about Oklahoma torpedo)
- USS Ward sinking of Ha-19 was first American shots of Pacific War (before air attack began)
- Sakamaki's capture provided intelligence

**Sydney Harbor Attack (May 31-June 1, 1942):**
*Three midget subs attacked Sydney*

**Background:**
- Special attack on Sydney Harbor, Australia
- Three Ko-hyoteki launched from mother subs
- Mission: Penetrate harbor, sink Allied warships

**Results:**
- **All 3 boats lost**
- **6 crew killed** (suicide when trapped)
- Torpedoes missed warships but hit depot ship HMAS Kuttabul
- **21 Allied sailors killed** on Kuttabul
- Most successful midget submarine attack
- Wrecks recovered, crews given military honors by Australians

**Attack on Diego Suarez, Madagascar (May 30, 1942):**
*Two midget subs attacked British fleet*

**Background:**
- British occupation of Diego Suarez
- Two Ko-hyoteki launched from I-16 and I-20

**Results:**
- **HMS Ramillies** (battleship) torpedoed and damaged
- **British tanker damaged and sunk**
- **Both midget subs lost**
- **4 crew killed**
- Most successful attack - battleship damaged

**Guadalcanal Operations (1942-1943):**
- Multiple Ko-hyoteki used against US forces
- All lost without significant results
- Difficult to employ in open waters vs harbors

**Specifications - Type 97 Torpedo:**
- **Diameter:** 450mm (17.7 inches)
- **Length:** 5.5 meters (18 feet)
- **Warhead:** 300 kg (661 lbs)
- **Range:** 5,500 meters (6,000 yards)
- Smaller than standard Type 93/95 torpedoes

**Tactical Concept:**
**Theory:**
- Stealth attack on anchored ships
- Small size avoids detection
- Surprise torpedo attack
- Escape after firing (theoretically)

**Reality:**
- Most boats detected and destroyed
- Limited range prevented escape
- Crews usually killed or captured
- Minimal damage inflicted
- More symbolic than effective

**Loss Statistics:**
- **~50 built**
- **Most lost in action or scuttled**
- **Pearl Harbor:** 5 lost, 0 kills
- **Sydney Harbor:** 3 lost, 1 transport damaged (21 killed)
- **Diego Suarez:** 2 lost, 1 battleship damaged
- **Others:** Lost in various operations
- **Survival rate:** ~0% (few if any returned from missions)

**Crew Experience:**
**Training:**
- Selected volunteers (suicide mission understood)
- Extensive training in handling tiny submarine
- Practice attacks in Japanese waters
- Psychological preparation for likely death

**Mission:**
- Launched from mother submarine
- Navigate to target (periscope/dead reckoning)
- Penetrate harbor defenses
- Fire torpedoes at targets
- Attempt escape (rarely possible)
- If captured: Suicide preferred over capture (Bushido code)

**Why So Ineffective:**
1. **Easy to detect:** Small but still visible, noisy
2. **Limited weapons:** Only 2 torpedoes
3. **Navigation difficulties:** Tiny periscope, poor visibility
4. **Battery limitation:** Short range, slow speed submerged
5. **No escape plan:** One-way mission in practice
6. **Determined defense:** Depth charges, patrols effective

**Ensign Sakamaki - The Survivor:**
- Only Pearl Harbor midget sub crew captured alive
- Ha-16 ran aground, Sakamaki escaped but captured
- First Japanese POW of Pacific War
- Provided intelligence on midget submarines
- Survived war, later became Toyota executive
- Controversial in Japan (capture vs suicide)

**Comparison - Midget Submarines:**
| Type | Nation | Crew | Displacement | Torpedoes | Success |
|------|--------|------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Ko-hyoteki** | **Japan** | **2** | **46 tons** | **2** | **Low** |
| X-craft | UK | 4 | 30 tons | 2 mines | Tirpitz damaged |
| CB-class | Italy | 2 | 36 tons | 2 | Several ships |
| Seehund | Germany | 2 | 15 tons | 2 | Several ships |

**Later Variants:**
- **Type C (Kairyu):** 2-man, internal torpedoes
- **Type D (Koryu):** 5-man, longer range
- **Kaiten:** 1-man suicide torpedo (evolved from concept)
- Each more desperate than last

**Cultural Significance:**
**In Japan:**
- Crews considered heroes
- "Nine Heroes" from Pearl Harbor attack (9 killed)
- Symbol of sacrifice and Bushido
- Controversial post-war (suicide missions)

**In Allied Nations:**
- Sydney crew given military honors
- Recognized bravery despite being enemy
- Wrecks preserved as war memorials

**Legacy:** Ko-hyoteki represented Japanese special attack philosophy - sacrifice for victory. Used at Pearl Harbor (all lost, no confirmed kills), Sydney Harbor (damaged transport), Diego Suarez (damaged battleship). Essentially suicide weapons with minimal effectiveness. Two-man crews faced almost certain death. Most famous for Pearl Harbor attack and being first shots of Pacific War (USS Ward vs Ha-19). Ensign Sakamaki's capture provided intelligence. Showed bravery but poor return on investment. Influenced later suicide weapons (Kaiten). Name: Ko-hyoteki means "Target 'A'" or "Model A" (Type A classification).

**Historical Significance:** Ko-hyoteki embodied Japanese willingness to sacrifice lives for tactical advantage. Pearl Harbor attack (5 boats, all lost) achieved nothing militarily but provided propaganda value. First American killed at Pearl Harbor may have been from Ko-hyoteki torpedo. USS Ward's sinking of Ha-19 was first American shots of Pacific War (before air raid began). Sydney Harbor attack most successful - damaged transport, killed 21. Diego Suarez damaged British battleship - best result. But overall, ~50 boats built, nearly all lost, minimal results achieved. Crews were brave but weapons were ineffective. Concept evolved into Kaiten (manned suicide torpedoes) - even more desperate. Showed IJN's growing desperation and willingness to waste lives for minimal gain.
