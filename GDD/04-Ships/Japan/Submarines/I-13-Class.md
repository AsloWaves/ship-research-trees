**Panama Canal Hunters** - I-13-class were the largest Japanese aircraft-carrying submarines. 2 boats commissioned 1944-1945. Two Seiran floatplane bombers carried for Panama Canal attack. Huge (2,934/4,172 tons), long range (21,000 nm). Both lost 1945. I-13 sunk by destroyer escort USS Lawrence C. Taylor (July 1945). I-14 surrendered August 1945, later scuttled by US Navy. Mission never accomplished - war ended first.

**Key Specs:** 2,934/4,172 tons | 373ft | 16.7/5.5 kn | 6× 533mm tubes (12 torpedoes) + 2 Seiran aircraft | 21,000 nm range | 2 boats

**Innovation:** Purpose-built aircraft-carrying submarines for strategic attacks. Two Aichi M6A Seiran floatplane bombers carried in watertight hangar forward of conning tower. Disassembled for storage, assembled for launch. Mission: Attack Panama Canal locks (disable canal, isolate Pacific from Atlantic). Huge range (21,000 nm - longest range Japanese subs). Large (373 ft). Six torpedo tubes + 12 torpedoes. 140mm deck gun. Slow submerged (5.5 knots) - penalty for large size. Two built 1944-1945. Both lost - I-13 sunk July 1945, I-14 surrendered then scuttled. Panama Canal mission never executed (war ended).

**Design:** Large hull (373 ft, 2,934 tons surfaced). Watertight aircraft hangar forward of conning tower (40 ft long). Two Seiran attack floatplanes stored disassembled. Small catapult for launch. Recovery by crane. Six bow torpedo tubes. Twelve torpedoes carried. Single 140mm deck gun. Three 25mm AA guns. Diesel-electric propulsion. Long range (21,000 nm at 16 knots). Slow submerged (5.5 knots - large size penalty). Crew 114. Designed for long-range strategic strikes with aircraft.

**Boats (2 built - both lost):**

**Lost in combat (1):**
1. **I-13** - Sunk July 16, 1945 (destroyer escort USS Lawrence C. Taylor, east of Yokosuka), all hands lost

**Surrendered (1):**
2. **I-14** - Surrendered August 1945 intact, scuttled by US Navy 1946 (Operation Deadlight)

- Purpose-built for submarine operations

**Operational Concept:**
1. Submarine approaches target (Panama Canal)
2. Surface at dawn
3. Assemble 2 Seirans (1 hour total)
4. Launch from catapult
5. Attack locks with bombs/torpedoes
6. Seirans ditch near friendly territory OR suicide attack
7. Submarine escapes

**Service History:**

**I-13 (December 1944 - July 1945):**

**December 1944 - March 1945: Work-up:**
- Commissioned December 16, 1944
- Training off Japan
- Seiran operations practice
- Crew familiarization

**April - June 1945: Mission Planning:**
- Panama Canal attack planned
- **Problem:** No nearby friendly bases for Seiran recovery
- **Solution:** One-way attack (suicide mission)
- **Preparation:** Intensive training

**July 1945: Final Mission:**
- **Mission change:** Transport mission to Truk
- Carrying fuel/supplies to isolated garrison
- **Seiran aircraft removed** (transport priority)
- **July 16, 1945:** Detected by US destroyer escort USS Lawrence C. Taylor
- East of Yokosuka
- Depth charged
- **Sunk with all hands** (114 killed)
- Mission incomplete
- Irony: Sunk before Panama Canal attack attempted

**I-14 (March 1945 - August 1945):**

**March - July 1945: Limited Service:**
- Commissioned March 14, 1945 (very late)
- Training only (war situation desperate)
- Never sent on combat mission
- Panama Canal attack mission assigned but not executed

**August 1945: Surrender:**
- Surrendered intact at Yokosuka
- Seiran aircraft intact aboard
- **US Navy inspection:** Highly interested in aircraft-carrying capability
- Seirans examined thoroughly
- Technology studied

**1946: Scuttled:**
- Operation Deadlight (disposal of captured Axis submarines)
- US Navy scuttled I-14 off Hawaii
- Sunk as target
- Aircraft technology information retained

**Panama Canal Attack Plan:**

**Background:**
- **Panama Canal:** Critical link between Atlantic and Pacific
- Locks vulnerable to attack
- Disable locks = isolate Pacific fleet from Atlantic reinforcements
- Strategic value enormous

**Plan:**
1. **I-13 and I-14** approach Panama (Pacific side)
2. Surface before dawn (20-30 miles offshore)
3. Assemble 4 Seirans total (2 per submarine)
4. Launch at dawn
5. Attack Gatun Locks (largest, most critical)
6. Each Seiran carries 800 kg bomb
7. **Objective:** Destroy lock gates (flood locks, disable canal)
8. Seirans ditch after attack (suicide mission - no recovery)
9. Submarines escape submerged

**Why Never Executed:**
1. **Timing:** I-13 commissioned December 1944, I-14 March 1945 (too late)
2. **War situation:** By mid-1945, Japan collapsing
3. **Allied strength:** Panama heavily defended by 1945
4. **Resources:** Subs needed for transport (fuel/food to isolated garrisons)
5. **Strategic shift:** Homeland defense priority
6. **I-13 lost:** Sunk July 1945 before mission
7. **War ended:** August 15, 1945 (I-14 never deployed)

**If Successful (Hypothetical):**
- Gatun Locks damaged/destroyed
- Panama Canal out of service 6-12 months (repair time)
- Atlantic fleet reinforcements delayed
- But: By 1945, too late to change war outcome
- US had alternative route (Magellan Strait) though slower
- Symbolic victory only

**USS Lawrence C. Taylor vs I-13 (July 16, 1945):**

**Background:**
- **USS Lawrence C. Taylor (DE-415):** Destroyer escort
- Anti-submarine patrol east of Japan
- I-13 on surface (traveling to Truk)

**July 16, 1945:**
**Detection:**
- Radar contact (I-13 surfaced)
- I-13 detected Taylor, crash dived
- Taylor gained sonar contact

**Attack:**
- Depth charge run
- Multiple patterns dropped
- Explosions heard
- Oil slick surfaced
- Debris confirmed kill

**Result:**
- **I-13 sunk with all hands** (114 killed)
- No survivors
- One month before surrender
- Largest aircraft-carrying sub lost

**Comparison - Aircraft-Carrying Submarines:**
| Type | Nation | Displacement | Aircraft | Range | Built | Lost |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|-------|-------|------|
| **I-13** | **Japan** | **2,934/4,172** | **2 Seiran** | **21,000 nm** | **2** | **2** |
| I-9 | Japan | 2,919/4,149 | 1 floatplane | 16,000 nm | 3 | 3 |
| I-400 | Japan | 3,530/6,560 | 3 Seiran | 37,500 nm | 3 | 3 |
| M2 | UK | 1,950/2,650 | 1 floatplane | 5,000 nm | 1 | 1 |

**I-13: Specialized Panama Canal attack submarines**

**Why 100% Loss Rate:**
1. **Timing:** Commissioned too late (December 1944, March 1945)
2. **War situation:** Japan losing, Allied ASW dominant
3. **I-13 lost:** Sunk July 1945 (one month before surrender)
4. **I-14 scuttled:** Captured intact, later disposed
5. **Mission never executed:** War ended before Panama Canal attack

**Seiran Aircraft Fate:**

**I-13's Seirans:**
- Removed before final mission (transport priority)
- Possibly destroyed ashore in air raids

**I-14's Seirans:**
- Captured intact by US Navy August 1945
- **Thoroughly examined** (unique design)
- Technology studied (submarine-launched aircraft)
- Later scrapped
- **One surviving Seiran today:** National Air and Space Museum, Washington DC (only example preserved)

**Legacy:** I-13-class represented Japan's most ambitious submarine-aircraft project. Two huge boats (2,934 tons) carrying two Seiran attack floatplanes each. Purpose: Attack Panama Canal locks, disable critical link between oceans. Enormous range (21,000 nm). But commissioned too late (December 1944, March 1945). I-13 sunk July 1945 by destroyer escort before mission. I-14 surrendered intact with Seirans aboard (August 1945), later scuttled by US Navy. Panama Canal attack never executed - war ended first. Seiran technology examined by US Navy. One Seiran preserved in Smithsonian. Showed Japan's desperate strategic thinking - brilliant concept, impossible timing. Names: I-13, I-14 (number designations).

**Historical Significance:** I-13-class epitomized Japan's late-war desperation mixed with innovation. Huge submarines carrying attack aircraft to destroy Panama Canal - strategically brilliant but hopelessly late. Commissioned December 1944/March 1945 when war already lost. I-13 sent on transport mission (not Panama attack) - sunk July 16, 1945, one month before surrender. I-14 never deployed - surrendered with Seirans intact. US Navy fascinated by technology - examined thoroughly. One Seiran survives in Smithsonian today (only example worldwide). Mission never executed shows "what might have been" if deployed 1942-1943 when possible. By 1945, Panama Canal heavily defended, mission likely suicide with no strategic impact. Represented Japanese technical excellence wasted by timing. Compare to I-400-class (3 Seirans each, even larger) - also never executed missions. Aircraft-carrying submarines: Amazing concept, zero combat success.
