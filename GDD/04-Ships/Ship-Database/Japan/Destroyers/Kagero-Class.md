## Historical Background

The Kagero class represented the culmination of Japanese destroyer development before the Pacific War. These powerful fleet destroyers were designed to screen the main battle fleet and deliver devastating torpedo attacks. Their Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedoes gave them striking power comparable to light cruisers.

The class saw extensive service throughout the Pacific War, with most ships lost in combat. Only one, Yukikaze, survived the war intact, becoming legendary for her extraordinary luck.
