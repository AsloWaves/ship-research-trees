## Historical Background

The Iowa-class battleships represent the pinnacle of American battleship design. Designed to counter the Japanese Kongo-class battlecruisers and provide fast carrier escort, these ships combined unprecedented speed with the firepower of the preceding South Dakota class. Their 33-knot speed made them the fastest battleships ever built by the US Navy, allowing them to operate with fast carrier task forces.

USS Missouri famously hosted the Japanese surrender ceremony on September 2, 1945, ending World War II.
