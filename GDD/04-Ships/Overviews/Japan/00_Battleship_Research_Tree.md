## Historical Context

### Modernization Era (1895-1905)
- Japan relied on British shipyards for first modern battleships
- Rapid naval expansion to counter Russian Pacific Fleet
- Battle of Tsushima (1905) - decisive victory using British-built battleships

### Domestic Production (1905-1920)
- First domestically-built battleships (Satsuma, 1911)
- Dreadnought revolution adopted quickly
- Post-WWI: most powerful battleships in world (Nagato-class 16" guns)

### Washington Treaty Era (1922-1937)
- Building holiday: Tosa, Kaga, Kii, Number 13 cancelled
- Extensive modernization of existing battleships
- Kongō-class rebuilt from battlecruisers to fast battleships

### WWII Era (1937-1945)
- Yamato and Musashi: largest battleships ever built
- Yamato-class featured 18.1" guns (largest naval weapons)
- Aircraft carriers proved dominant; battleship era ended
- Most Japanese battleships sunk 1944-1945

## Notable Service

### Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)
- Mikasa, Fuji, Shikishima, Asahi - Battle of Tsushima
- Captured 5 Russian battleships

### World War I (1914-1918)
- Limited action in Pacific theater

### World War II (1941-1945)
- **Pearl Harbor (1941):** Battleships held in reserve for decisive fleet action
- **Midway (1942):** Yamato as flagship, did not engage
- **Guadalcanal (1942):** Hiei, Kirishima sunk in surface actions
- **Leyte Gulf (1944):** Yamato, Musashi, Fusō, Yamashiro, Kongō engaged; most sunk
- **Ten-Go Operation (1945):** Yamato sunk by aircraft, April 7, 1945
