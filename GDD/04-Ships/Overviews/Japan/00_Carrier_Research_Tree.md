## Historical Context

### Early Development (1922-1935)
- Hosho commissioned 1922 as world's first purpose-designed aircraft carrier
- Washington Naval Treaty (1922) allowed conversion of Akagi and Kaga
- Japan pioneered carrier aviation tactics and doctrine
- Development of specialized carrier aircraft

### Pre-WWII Expansion (1935-1941)
- Purpose-built fleet carriers (Soryu, Hiryu, Shokaku, Zuikaku)
- Formation of Kido Butai (Carrier Strike Force)
- China operations demonstrated carrier effectiveness
- Conversion of auxiliary ships to light carriers

### WWII Era (1941-1945)
- Pearl Harbor attack (1941) - 6 fleet carriers
- Midway (1942) - Loss of Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu
- Rapid carrier construction program (Unryu-class)
- Conversions from various ship types due to losses
- Armored carriers (Taiho, Shinano) developed
- Most carriers sunk 1942-1945

## Notable Service

### Pearl Harbor (December 1941)
- **Kido Butai**: Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, Shokaku, Zuikaku
- 353 aircraft launched in two waves
- Decisive victory establishing carrier supremacy

### Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942)
- Shokaku damaged, Shoho sunk
- First carrier vs carrier battle

### Battle of Midway (June 1942)
- Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu all sunk
- Turning point of Pacific War
- End of Japanese carrier superiority

### Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 1944)
- "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"
- Taiho, Shokaku sunk
- Massive Japanese aircraft losses

### Battle of Cape Engaño (October 1944)
- Zuikaku, Zuiho, Chitose, Chiyoda sunk
- Decoy operation for Leyte Gulf
- End of Japanese carrier aviation

### Final Operations (1944-1945)
- Remaining carriers used as decoys or stationary AA platforms
- Unryu, Amagi, Kaiyo sunk by air raids or submarines
- Shinano sunk 10 days after commissioning (shortest service of any major warship)
