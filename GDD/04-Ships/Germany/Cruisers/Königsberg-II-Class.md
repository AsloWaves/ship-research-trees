**Ultimate WWI German Light Cruiser Design** - 4 ships built (1916-1918): Königsberg II, Karlsruhe II, Emden II, Nürnberg II. Named after famous WWI cruisers lost in action. Improved Wiesbaden design: larger (5,440 tons vs. 5,180), longer range (5,300 nm vs. 4,800). 8× 15cm guns, 28.5 knots. Last WWI German light cruisers commissioned. **All four survived WWI**. **SMS Emden II**: Famous post-WWI training cruiser (1920s-1940s), WWII mine-laying operations, bombed and capsized (1945), raised and scrapped (1949).

**Key Features:** Ultimate WWI design | All four survived WWI | Named after famous lost cruisers | Emden II: Famous training cruiser (1920s-1940s) | Improved Wiesbaden

**Ships:** SMS Königsberg II (French war prize 1920 as Metz, scrapped 1936), SMS Karlsruhe II (British war prize 1920, scrapped 1923), SMS Emden II (survived WWI, training cruiser 1920s-1940s, WWII service, capsized 1945, scrapped 1949), SMS Nürnberg II (French war prize 1920, scrapped 1922)

**Service:** WWI High Seas Fleet (1916-1918). Limited WWI service (commissioned late). All four survived WWI, surrendered 1918. Königsberg II: French war prize 1920 (Metz), scrapped 1936. Karlsruhe II: British war prize 1920, scrapped 1923. Nürnberg II: French war prize 1920, scrapped 1922. **Emden II**: Only one retained by Germany (Versailles Treaty allowed), famous training cruiser (1920s-1940s), circumnavigated globe multiple times, WWII mine-laying operations (1939-1945), bombed by RAF (9 Apr 1945), capsized in Heikendorfer Bay, raised and scrapped (1949). Most successful post-WWI German light cruiser.
