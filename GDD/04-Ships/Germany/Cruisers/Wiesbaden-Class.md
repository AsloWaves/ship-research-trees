**Fast 15cm Light Cruiser Design** - 2 ships built (1915): Wiesbaden, Frankfurt. Balanced design: 8× 15cm guns, 28.8 knots (faster than Graudenz's 12× guns/28.2 knots). 5,180 tons. **SMS Wiesbaden**: Most famous German cruiser loss at Battle of Jutland (31 May-1 Jun 1916), caught between British and German battle lines, sunk after concentrated fire from multiple British ships, **entire crew killed** (589 killed, 0 survivors). **SMS Frankfurt**: Survived WWI, US war prize 1920, target ship, sunk in bombing tests 1921.

**Key Features:** Fast 15cm design (28.8 knots) | Wiesbaden: Sunk at Jutland (entire crew killed, 589 killed) | Caught between battle lines | Frankfurt: US war prize

**Ships:** SMS Wiesbaden (sunk at Jutland 31 May-1 Jun 1916, 589 killed, entire crew, 0 survivors), SMS Frankfurt (survived WWI, US war prize 1920, bombing target 1921)
