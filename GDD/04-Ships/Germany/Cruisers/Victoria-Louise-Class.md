**Germany's Last Protected Cruiser Class** - 5 ships built (1899-1900): Victoria Louise, Hertha, Freya, Vineta, Hansa. Transitional design between protected and armored cruisers. 5,660 tons, 2× 21cm + 8× 15cm guns, 19 knots. Mixed armament combined cruiser (15cm) and battleship (21cm) calibers. Last German cruisers with armored deck protection only (no side belt). All five survived WWI, decommissioned 1914-1916 for training/depot ship duties. Replaced by armored cruiser concept with side belt armor.

**Key Features:** Last protected cruisers (1899) | Mixed armament: 2× 21cm + 8× 15cm | Armored deck only, no side belt | All 5 survived WWI

**Service:** Peacetime overseas service (1900-1914): China, Mediterranean, training cruises. WWI: All five decommissioned 1914-1916 due to obsolescence, converted to training ships and accommodation hulks. None saw combat. Hansa: Last to decommission (1916), served as depot ship Hamburg. All scrapped 1919-1923. Demonstrated limitations of protected cruiser concept, leading to armored cruiser development.
