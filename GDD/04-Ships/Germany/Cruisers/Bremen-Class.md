**First Expanded Production Light Cruiser Class** - 7 ships built (1904-1907): Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Lübeck, München, Leipzig, Danzig. Improved Gazelle design: larger (3,250 tons vs. 2,644), faster (23.5 knots vs. 22.3). 10× 10.5cm guns. Established German light cruiser standard for WWI. Notable losses: SMS Leipzig sunk at Battle of Falkland Islands (8 Dec 1914, 315 killed), SMS Bremen scuttled at Zanzibar (10 Aug 1914). Most served as commerce raiders and High Seas Fleet scouts. Demonstrated successful light cruiser concept.

**Key Features:** First expanded production class (7 ships) | Improved Gazelle design | Leipzig: Sunk at Falklands (315 killed) | Commerce raider operations

**Ships:** SMS Bremen (scuttled Zanzibar 10 Aug 1914), SMS Hamburg, SMS Berlin, SMS Lübeck, SMS München, SMS Leipzig (sunk Falklands 8 Dec 1914, 315 killed, 18 survivors), SMS Danzig

**Service:** WWI High Seas Fleet scouting and commerce raiding (1914-1918). Bremen: Scuttled Zanzibar 10 Aug 1914 to avoid capture. Leipzig: East Asia Squadron, Battle of Falkland Islands (8 Dec 1914, sunk by HMS Cornwall, 315 killed, 18 survivors). Most others: High Seas Fleet service, surrendered 1918, scrapped 1919-1929. Bremen-class validated light cruiser concept for scouting and raiding.
