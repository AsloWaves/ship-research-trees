**Germany's Last and Largest Armored Cruiser (Transitional Design)** - Commissioned 1909, sunk 1915. Transitional design approaching battlecruiser concept. Largest (15,842 tons), most heavily-armed (12× 21cm guns), and fastest (25.8 knots) German armored cruiser. Designed to counter British Invincible-class battlecruisers, but outmatched by them due to smaller guns (21cm vs. 30.5cm). **Battle of Dogger Bank** (24 Jan 1915): Sunk by British battlecruisers Lion, Tiger, and Princess Royal after 3-hour running battle. 792 killed, 234 survivors. Last German armored cruiser, followed by Von der Tann true battlecruiser.

**Key Features:** Largest German armored cruiser (15,842 tons) | 12× 21cm guns (most heavily-armed) | Battle of Dogger Bank (792 killed) | Transitional to battlecruiser

**Ships:** SMS Blücher (single ship, sunk Dogger Bank 24 Jan 1915, 792 killed, 234 survivors)

**Service:** High Seas Fleet (1909-1915). Battle of Dogger Bank (24 Jan 1915): German raid on British coast, engaged by British battlecruisers. Blücher left behind as slowest German ship (25 knots vs. 28-29 knots for German battlecruisers). Concentrated fire from 3 British battlecruisers (Lion, Tiger, Princess Royal). Capsized after 3-hour battle (792 killed, 234 survivors). Demonstrated armored cruiser obsolescence against battlecruisers, leading to German battlecruiser focus (Derfflinger-class).
