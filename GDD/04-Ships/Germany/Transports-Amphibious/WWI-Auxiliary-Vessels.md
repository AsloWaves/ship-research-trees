**Limited Information** - WWI Era (1914-1918) Imperial German Navy primarily used requisitioned civilian vessels for transport operations. Few purpose-built auxiliary vessels documented.

**Key Types:** Auxiliary vessels, depot ships, tenders. Hospital ships and wounded transport ships operated during WWI. Germany was blockaded early, limiting overseas transport operations.

**Note:** Kriegsmarine focused on combat vessels (U-boats, battleships, cruisers). Transport operations relied on requisitioned merchant vessels rather than dedicated military transports. Comprehensive documentation of individual auxiliary vessels from this era is limited in available sources.
