**Largest U-boat Tenders** - Wilhelm Bauer-class were largest Kriegsmarine U-boat tenders. 3 ships built 1940-1943 at Howaldtswerke Kiel.

**Key Specs:** 5,600-5,900 tons | 132-139m | 18-21 kn | 289-310 crew + 423-440 submarine crews

**Innovation:** Germany's most ambitious submarine tender design. Planned as class of 8 ships (only 3 completed). Mobile logistical hubs providing comprehensive U-boat support: extensive workshops, ammunition/torpedo storage, fuel tanks, provisions, accommodations for entire flotilla crews. "Floating base" concept critical for Baltic training areas at Pillau and Gotenhafen.

**Design:** Named after submarine pioneers. Wilhelm Bauer (lead ship) named for designer of Brandtaucher (1850), Germany's first submarine. Waldemar Kophamel and Otto Wünsche named for WWI U-boat aces. Armed with 2-4× 105mm guns, AA weapons. Otto Wünsche slightly larger/faster variant: 5,900 tons, 21.5 knots vs sisters' 5,600 tons, 18-20 knots.

**Service:** Operated Baltic Sea 1940-1945 supporting 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th U-boat Flotillas. Wilhelm Bauer bombed/sunk Travemünde 8 April 1945. Waldemar Kophamel sunk by RAF 18 Dec 1944, raised by Soviets 1950, repaired Neptun shipyard Rostock, renamed Kuban—served Soviet Northern Fleet until 17 Sept 1973 (33 years total). Otto Wünsche survived ammunition explosion Flensburg June 1945, captured by Soviets March 1946, renamed Pechora—served Soviet Northern Fleet 1946-1973 (30 years). Remarkable longevity: two ships gave Soviets 23-27 additional years Cold War service.
