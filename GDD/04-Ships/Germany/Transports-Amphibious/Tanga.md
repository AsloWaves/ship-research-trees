**Enlarged S-boat Tender** - Tanga was enlarged S-boat tender serving Kriegsmarine WWII. Originally laid down as Qi Jiguang for Republic of China Navy at AG Neptun, Rostock.

**Key Specs:** 2,620 tons | 96.2m | 17.5 kn | 149 crew + 251 S-boat crews | 8,450 nm range @ 9 kn

**Innovation:** Evolutionary improvement over pioneering Tsingtau (1934). While not sister ship, embodied lessons from Tsingtau's operational success. Increased size: 2,620 tons vs 2,490 tons, 96.2m vs 87.46m length—enhanced capacity for stores, fuel, ammunition. Extended range 8,450 nm provided sustained forward deployment capability. Enhanced armament: 2× 10.5cm SK L/45 guns (larger than Tsingtau's 88mm), plus 2× 3.7cm and 4× 2cm AA guns. Opportunistic acquisition: purchased incomplete from China, demonstrated pragmatic approach to expanding S-boat support without lengthy new construction.

**Design:** Launched 4 Dec 1937 as Qi Jiguang (named after Ming Dynasty general). Purchased incomplete by Kriegsmarine 1938. Renamed Tanga 12 Dec 1938 after port city in German East Africa (site of Battle of Tanga, Nov 1914). Commissioned 21 Jan 1939. Provided accommodation, fuel depot, ammunition, workshop, medical facilities for S-boat crews.

**Service:** Assigned initially to 2nd Schnellboot Flotilla at Heligoland 1939. Transferred to 6th Flotilla 1940 for southern North Sea/English Channel operations. Served northern Norway as Admiral Schmundt's staff ship 1941-1942. Spent remainder of war with S-Boot-Schulverband training unit in Baltic. Post-surrender: German Mine Sweeping Administration 10 May 1945 - 3 Dec 1947. Sold to Denmark 8 June 1948. Commissioned Royal Danish Navy as Ægir (A560) 12 Dec 1951—served as tender/command ship/training ship until 10 Jan 1967. Training cruises to Canada (1958), Mediterranean (1961). Total service: 30 years across three flags. Scrapped July 1967.
