**Fleet Tankers** - Rhön-class (Type 704A) were largest German Navy replenishment tankers of Cold War era. 2 ships 1977-2018.

**Key Specs:** 14,396 tons | 130.2m × 19.3m | 16 kn | Civilian crew | 11,500 m³ fuel capacity

**Innovation:** Germany's largest naval replenishment tankers until Type 707. Unusual origin story: two bulk acid tankers (Okene and Okapi) ordered by Libya from Kröger yard Rendsburg. Launched 1974-1975, while still under construction acquired by West German Navy 1976 for conversion to naval replenishment tankers. Entered service 1977 as FGS Rhön and FGS Spessart. Massive fuel capacity: 11,500 m³—far exceeding earlier Type 701/703 classes. Propulsion: 5,880 kW for 16 knots. Civilian-crewed like Walchensee-class. Full load displacement 14,396 tonnes made them substantially larger than previous German Navy auxiliaries.

**Design:** Named after German mountain ranges: Rhön (A1437) and Spessart (A1442). Originally commercial bulk carrier design adapted for naval use. Gross register tonnage 6,103 GRT, deadweight tonnage 10,800 DWT. Converted from acid tankers to fuel oil replenishment vessels 1976-1977. Beam of 19.3m provided stability for underway replenishment operations.

**Service:** Commissioned 1977, served throughout Cold War and post-reunification era supporting German Navy fleet operations worldwide. Primary role: underway replenishment of fuel to warships at sea during extended operations. Both ships served 41 years 1977-2018—remarkable longevity for converted commercial vessels. Decommissioned 2018. Replaced by new-construction Type 707 EGV (Einsatzgruppenversorger) class—first purpose-built large fleet tankers since WWII.
