**First S-boat Tender** - Tsingtau was first purpose-built Schnellboot (S-boat/E-boat) tender in Kriegsmarine. Built 1933-1934 by Blohm & Voss Hamburg.

**Key Specs:** 2,490 tons | 87.46m | 17.5 kn | 149 crew + 251 S-boat crews | 8,500 nm range @ 15 kn

**Innovation:** Significant innovation in German naval logistics. Prior to commissioning, S-boats supported by generic fleet tenders lacking speed to keep pace with fast attack craft. Tsingtau pioneered mobile support: 17.5 knots to operate alongside S-boat flotillas, specialized accommodations for 251 crews, integrated logistics (ammunition, fuel, supplies), workshop facilities with 146 ratings for on-site maintenance. Created template for mobile support allowing flotillas to operate from forward positions without permanent shore facilities.

**Design:** Named after Tsingtau (Qingdao), former German colony in China. Armed with 2× 88mm/45 guns, upgraded to 8× 20mm Flak from Feb 1940. Commissioned 24 Sept 1934. Redesignated from Flottentender to Schnellbootbegleitschiff (S-boat escort ship) 5 March 1936.

**Service:** Operated primarily Baltic Sea 1934-1945 supporting multiple S-boat flotillas. Brief training ship role (Flak-Schulschiff/Kadettenschulschiff) Feb-April 1940. Participated Operation Weserübung (Norway invasion) April 1940—transported 1,100 troops to Kristiansand. Supported 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th S-Flotillas through 1945. Finest hour: Operation Hannibal evacuations May 1945—evacuated 3,500 people from Gotenhafen 5 May, carried 2,000-3,000 wounded/refugees in last convoy from Libau 8 May (hours before war's end). Captured by Britain 12 May 1945. Used for North Sea mine clearance 1945-1950. Scrapped Clayton & Davie, Dunston-on-Tyne UK, February 1950.
