**Salvage Tugs** - Helgoland/Fehmarn-class (Type 720) are large seagoing salvage tugs for German Navy. 2 ships 1966-1967, 1 remains in service.

**Key Specs:** 1,181 GRT | 68m × 12.74m | ~12-14 kn | Civilian crew | Diesel-electric propulsion

**Innovation:** Large seagoing salvage tugs built by Schichau-Unterweser AG, Bremerhaven. Diesel-electric propulsion system provides excellent low-speed manoeuvrability for towing/salvage operations. Multi-role capabilities: salvage tug, icebreaker, wreck search, firefighting, target towing. Support and training vehicle for submarine operations. Practice mine recovery vehicle. Diver platform for underwater operations. Helgoland (lead ship) and Fehmarn named after German islands. Class originally called Helgoland-class; after Helgoland's decommissioning, renamed Fehmarn-class in German Navy.

**Design:** Built 1966-1967. Helgoland commissioned 1966, Fehmarn (A1458) commissioned 1 Feb 1967. Like other German auxiliary ships, civilian-crewed rather than military personnel. Robust construction for ocean towing and salvage in North Sea/Baltic Sea conditions. Diesel-electric propulsion provides precise control for salvage/towing operations. Large bollard pull for hauling disabled vessels.

**Service:** Operated throughout Cold War and post-reunification era supporting German Navy fleet operations. Primary missions: hauling and towing naval vessels, assistance at sea, submarine support/training, mine recovery practice, diver operations platform. Helgoland decommissioned after decades of service. Fehmarn remains in service 2020s—50+ year service life demonstrates exceptional durability and continued utility. No replacement class planned—role remains essential for German Navy operations.
