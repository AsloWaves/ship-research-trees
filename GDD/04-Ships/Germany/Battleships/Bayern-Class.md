**Germany's Only Super-Dreadnoughts** - First German 15-inch guns (38cm, 750kg shells = +85% over König). Excellent armor (350mm belt + 350mm turret faces). NEVER FOUGHT - SMS Bayern commissioned 3 weeks AFTER Jutland, SMS Baden 9 months later. SMS Baden surrendered to Royal Navy (only major German battleship captured intact), trials ship, provided invaluable intelligence, sunk as target 1921.

**Key Features:** First 15-inch guns | 750kg shells (+85% over König) | Never fought | SMS Baden captured intact | Too late for Jutland

**Ships:** SMS Bayern (scuttled Scapa Flow 1919, raised 1934), SMS Baden (surrendered Royal Navy, trials ship, sunk as target 1921). Sachsen, Württemberg cancelled 1917.

**Service:** No combat (post-Jutland stalemate). SMS Baden fleet flagship 1917-1918. Scuttled/surrendered 1919. SMS Baden provided Royal Navy complete German technology intelligence.
