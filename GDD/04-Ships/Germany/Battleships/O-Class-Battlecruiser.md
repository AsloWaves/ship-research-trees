# O-Class in Plan Z
plan_z_battlecruisers: 3× O-class fast raiders planned (O, P, Q)

construction_planned: Construction planned to start 1939-1940

u_boat_priority: Dönitz's U-boat campaign prioritized
surface_fleet_abandoned: Germany abandoned surface fleet expansion

# Comparison to Other Battlecruisers

# vs German Ships
vs_scharnhorst: Faster (35 vs 32 kts), fewer guns (6×38cm vs 9×28cm)
vs_gneisenau: Same comparison as Scharnhorst
vs_derfflinger: Heavier (35,240 vs 26,600 tons), faster (35 vs 26.5 kts)

# vs Allied Battlecruisers
vs_hms_hood: Lighter (35,240 vs 46,680 tons), faster (35 vs 32 kts)
vs_alaska_class: Similar size (35,240 vs 34,253 tons), similar guns
vs_dunkerque: Heavier (35,240 vs 35,500 tons), comparable speed

# Hypothetical Assessment

# Combat Role (If Built)
primary_mission: Atlantic commerce raiding, convoy destruction
cruiser_killer: Outgun any British cruiser (6×15" vs cruiser 6-8")
run_from_battleships: Run from British battleships (35 kts escape!)
convoy_massacre: Could destroy entire convoys before battleship arrival
u_boat_cooperation: Coordinate with U-boat wolfpacks
support_role: Support Bismarck/Tirpitz Atlantic operations

# Combat Effectiveness (Hypothetical)
vs_cruisers: Overwhelming advantage (6×15" guns!)
vs_battleships: Disadvantage (thin armor, fewer guns) - RUN AWAY!
vs_carriers: Would be sunk by air attack (no AA defense sufficient!)
speed_advantage: 35 kts allows escape from most threats
armor_weakness: 160mm belt vulnerable to battleship fire
realistic_fate: Likely sunk by air power (RAF/Fleet Air Arm)

# Reality Check

# Construction Impossibility (1939-1945)
construction_time: Would require 3-4 years minimum (1939-1942/1943)
resources_needed: Germany needed U-boats, tanks, aircraft - NOT battlecruisers!
fuel_shortage: Germany couldn't fuel existing ships by 1941
bismarck_lesson: Bismarck's loss (1941) proved surface ships futile
tirpitz_example: Tirpitz bottled up in Norway - surface fleet impotent
air_power_dominance: Air power dominated by 1942 - capital ships obsolete

# Strategic Assessment
u_boat_correct: Dönitz's U-boat strategy proved correct!
surface_fleet_failed: German surface fleet achieved little in WWII
plan_z_fantasy: Plan Z was fantasy disconnected from coming reality
o_class_fate: Would have been sunk or bottled up like Bismarck/Tirpitz
resources_wasted: Resources better spent on U-boats (proven correct!)

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[SMS-Derfflinger-Battlecruiser]]" (WWI era)
successor: "[[P-Class-Battlecruiser]]" (improved O-class design)
contemporary: HMS Hood (1920 - 15" guns), Alaska-class (1944 - 12" guns)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - **PLAN Z BATTLECRUISER!** (Fast commerce raider!)
  - 35,240 tons standard, 38,500 tons full load
  - 3 ships planned (O, P, Q) - NEVER laid down!
  - 6× 38cm (15") guns in 3× twin turrets (2 superfiring forward + 1 aft)
  - **35 KNOTS** maximum speed (VERY FAST for capital ship!)
  - 176,000 shp turbines (high power for speed!)
  - 9,000 nm range at 19 knots (commerce raiding capability!)
  - Thin armor: 160mm belt (emphasized speed over protection!)
  - Design philosophy: SPEED + RANGE + FIREPOWER!
  - Designed to hunt British cruisers & destroy convoys!
  - Faster than battleships (35 vs 30 kts), outgun cruisers (15" vs 6-8")!
  - Part of Plan Z program (1939-1945 planned)
  - Design completed 1938-1939
  - **CANCELLED September 1939** (WWII outbreak!)
  - Never laid down (unlike H-39)
  - All resources diverted to U-boats, destroyers, aircraft
  - Dönitz's U-boat priority proved correct!
  - Would have been 3-4 year construction (1939-1942/1943)
  - Germany couldn't fuel existing ships by 1941!
  - Bismarck's loss (1941) proved surface fleet futility
  - Would likely be sunk by air power (RAF/Fleet Air Arm)
  - Resources better spent on U-boats (proven in hindsight!)
  - Plan Z fantasy vs WWII reality!

**PLAN Z RAIDER - 1939 Fast Commerce Raider!** - 3 ships planned: **O, P, Q** (NEVER laid down!). **35,240 tons**, **35 KNOTS** (VERY FAST!), **6× 38cm (15") guns** in **3× twin turrets** (2 forward + 1 aft). 9,000 nm range (Atlantic raiding!). Thin armor (160mm belt - emphasized SPEED over protection!). Design: **SPEED + RANGE + FIREPOWER!** Hunt British cruisers & destroy convoys! Faster than BBs (35 vs 30 kts), outgun cruisers (15" vs 6-8")! Part of Plan Z (1938-1939 design). **CANCELLED September 1939** (WWII outbreak!). Never laid down. All resources to U-boats/destroyers/aircraft. Dönitz's U-boat priority CORRECT! Would need 3-4 years (1939-1942/1943). Germany couldn't fuel existing ships by 1941! Bismarck's loss proved surface futility. Would likely be sunk by air power! Resources better spent on U-boats! **Plan Z fantasy vs WWII reality!**
