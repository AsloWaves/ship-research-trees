# Innovation
firsts:
  - **ALL-CENTERLINE TURRET LAYOUT!** (Finally optimal!)
  - **SUPERIOR BROADSIDE!** All 10 guns on broadside (vs Kaiser's 8!)
  - **IMPROVED FORWARD FIRE!** 4 guns forward (vs Kaiser's 2!)
  - 25,796 tons standard (+5% over Kaiser)
  - 21 knots maximum speed (turbines)
  - 4 ships built (König, Großer Kurfürst, Markgraf, Kronprinz)
  - 10× 30.5cm guns in 5× twin centerline turrets (2+1+2 layout)
  - Abandoned Kaiser's inefficient wing en echelon turrets
  - Amidships centerline turret (instead of 2 wing turrets)
  - Superior firing arcs in all directions
  - Commissioned August-November 1914 (right as WWI started!)
  - Laid down October 1911-March 1912
  - König launched March 1, 1913
  - All 4 fought at Battle of Jutland (May 31-June 1, 1916)
  - König: Hit 10 times - HEAVY combat! (survived!)
  - Großer Kurfürst: Hit 8 times - HEAVY damage! (survived!)
  - Markgraf: Hit 5 times (survived)
  - Kronprinz: Hit 1 time (survived)
