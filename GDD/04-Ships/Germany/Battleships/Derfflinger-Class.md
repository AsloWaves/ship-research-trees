**Germany's Best WWI Battlecruisers** - First German 12-inch gun battlecruisers. 300mm armor (+31% thicker than British). SMS Derfflinger "Iron Dog" survived 31 hits at Jutland (3,300 tons flooding). SMS Lützow only German battlecruiser sunk at Jutland (24+ hits before scuttling). **Vindicated German philosophy:** balanced armor + speed vs British speed-first. All post-Jutland navies adopted German approach.

**Key Features:** First German 12-inch guns | "Iron Dog" 31 hits survived | Only 1 of 3 lost at Jutland | Design philosophy vindicated

**Ships:** SMS Derfflinger, SMS Lützow, SMS Hindenburg

**Service:** Jutland (31 May 1916): Derfflinger 31 hits survived, Lützow 24+ hits scuttled (only German battlecruiser loss), Hindenburg not yet commissioned. British lost 3 battlecruisers from 2-4 hits each (magazine explosions). Scuttled Scapa Flow 1919, salvaged 1927-1939.
