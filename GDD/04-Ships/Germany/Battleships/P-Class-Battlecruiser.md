atlantic_perfection: Perfect for Atlantic commerce raiding (unlimited range!)
fuel_efficiency: Diesel = massive fuel savings over pure turbines!
speed_maintained: Maintains 35.5 kts despite diesel (turbine boost!)

# Plan Z Program - Improved O-Class

# Design Evolution
o_class_improvement: Improved version of O-class design
diesel_advantage: Deutschland-class proved diesel viability
range_doubled: 16,000 nm vs O-class 9,000 nm (78% increase!)
cost_increased: More expensive due to diesel engines
complexity_increased: More complex propulsion = longer build time
plan_z_late: Later addition to Plan Z program

# Design Features
deutschland_lessons: Applied lessons from Deutschland-class success
man_engines: Same MAN diesel engines as Deutschland-class
turbine_retention: Retained turbines for sprint speed (35.5 kts)
best_of_both: Combined diesel range + turbine speed!
commerce_raider_ultimate: Ultimate commerce raider design
atlantic_dominance: Could operate in Atlantic indefinitely!

# Cancellation (September 1939)
wwii_outbreak: WWII started September 1, 1939
plan_z_cancelled: **ALL Plan Z ships cancelled!**
never_laid_down: Not even design finalized (unlike O-class)
resource_priority: U-boats, destroyers, aircraft prioritized
surface_fleet_abandoned: Germany abandoned capital ship construction
diesel_engines_diverted: Diesel engines needed for U-boats instead!

# Hypothetical Comparison

# vs O-Class
improved_range: 16,000 nm vs 9,000 nm (+78% range!)
slightly_larger: 36,500 vs 35,240 tons (+3.6% displacement)
diesel_advantage: Diesel = fuel efficiency + range
complexity_cost: More complex, more expensive, longer build time
same_armament: Same 6×38cm guns, same speed (35-35.5 kts)

# vs Deutschland-Class
larger: 36,500 vs 12,340 tons (196% heavier!)
faster: 35.5 vs 28.5 kts (+7 kts faster!)
more_guns: 6×38cm vs 6×28cm (larger caliber!)
similar_range: 16,000 vs 16,300 nm (comparable!)
battlecruiser_vs_panzerschiff: True battlecruiser vs pocket battleship

# Hypothetical Combat Assessment

# Commerce Raiding Potential
unlimited_range: 16,000 nm = operate anywhere in Atlantic!
cruiser_killer: 6×15" guns destroy any cruiser
battleship_escape: 35.5 kts escape from battleships
convoy_threat: Could destroy convoys indefinitely
fuel_advantage: Diesel = less frequent refueling
support_network: Could operate far from supply bases
ultimate_raider: Best commerce raider design on paper!

# Reality Assessment
construction_impossible: Would require 4+ years (1939-1943+)
fuel_shortage: Germany had fuel shortages by 1941
bismarck_lesson: Bismarck proved surface raiders futile
air_power_threat: Would be sunk by carrier aircraft
u_boat_superiority: U-boats proved more effective raiders
diesel_for_uboats: Diesel engines better used for U-boats!
realistic_fate: Would be sunk or bottled up like Tirpitz

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[O-Class-Battlecruiser]]"
successor: None (END OF BATTLECRUISER TREE!)
contemporary: None - most advanced battlecruiser design of era!
