# Innovation
firsts:
  - GERMANY'S ONLY CARRIER TO REACH 85% COMPLETION!
  - "85% Complete" special ability (+30% capability if completed, UNIQUE!)
  - FAMOUS UNFINISHED CARRIER! (most complete Axis carrier never commissioned!)
  - Launched December 8, 1938 (Countess Hella von Brandenstein-Zeppelin!)
  - UNIQUE DUAL-PURPOSE DESIGN! (carrier + cruiser!)
  - 16× 15CM GUNS! (heaviest carrier armament ever planned!)
  - 60mm armored flight deck! (British-style protection)
  - 100mm belt armor! (cruiser-level protection)
  - 42 aircraft planned (12 Bf 109T fighters + 30 Ju 87C Stukas!)
  - Bf 109T: Carrier-adapted Messerschmitt with folding wings, arresting hook
  - Ju 87C: Carrier-adapted Stuka dive bomber (proven dive-bombing!)
  - Construction suspended April 1940 (Norwegian campaign priority)
  - Hitler ordered scrapping January 1943 (U-boat resource priority)
  - Scuttled April 25, 1945 (prevent Soviet capture!)
  - NEVER COMMISSIONED! (closest Germany came to carrier aviation)
  - Found as wreck in Baltic Sea (Władysławowo, Poland)
  - Influenced post-war Soviet carrier studies

**Germany's Famous Unfinished Carrier!** - 1 boat: **GRAF ZEPPELIN** - **85% COMPLETE** but **NEVER COMMISSIONED!** Germany's closest approach to carrier aviation. **33,550 tons**, **33.8 kts**, **42 aircraft** (12 Bf 109T fighters + 30 Ju 87C Stuka dive bombers). **UNIQUE DUAL-PURPOSE DESIGN** with **16× 15cm guns** (HEAVIEST carrier armament ever planned!) combining carrier and cruiser roles. Armored flight deck (60mm), cruiser-level belt armor (100mm). **Keel laid Dec 28, 1936**, **launched Dec 8, 1938** by Countess Hella von Brandenstein-Zeppelin. Construction suspended April 1940 (Norwegian campaign priority), briefly resumed 1942-1943, then abandoned. Hitler ordered scrapping January 1943 (U-boat priority). **Scuttled April 25, 1945** to prevent Soviet capture. Wreck found in Baltic Sea near Władysławowo, Poland. **NEVER COMMISSIONED** - represents one of WWII's great "what ifs"!
