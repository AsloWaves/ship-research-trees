# Technology (Post-War Lessons)
flight_deck_design: Incorporating Pacific War lessons
hangar_design: Improved aircraft handling from Allied experience
jet_capability: Early jet aircraft capability (subsonic)
catapult_system: Hydraulic catapults (steam catapults not yet)
arresting_gear: Strengthened for heavier jet aircraft

# Historical Reality
west_germany: Prohibited from carriers (post-war restrictions)
east_germany: No carrier program (Soviet bloc, no carriers)
reality: Germany focused on U-boats and land forces
nato_role: NATO carrier aviation provided by US/Britain
speculation_level: PURE SPECULATION (no German carrier plans)

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Plan-Z-Super-Carrier]]"
successor: "[[Jet-Age-Carrier]]"
contemporary: US Forrestal-class concept (1950), British Audacious-class (1951)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - POST-WAR CARRIER CONCEPT! (1950 theoretical!)
  - Incorporating Pacific War lessons (theoretical knowledge)
  - Early jet aircraft capability (subsonic jets!)
  - Hydraulic catapults (improved from compressed air)
  - Guns removed (post-war carrier trend - missiles/aircraft only!)
  - 55,000 tons (post-war carrier size)
  - 50 aircraft (jet + piston transitional mix)
  - 12,000 nm range (improved endurance)
  - Allied carrier operations knowledge (theoretical)
  - PURE SPECULATION! (Germany prohibited from carriers!)
  - West Germany had no carrier program (NATO reliance)
  - East Germany had no carrier program (Soviet bloc)
  - Germany focused on submarines and land forces instead
  - THEORETICAL ONLY! (no plans, pure alternate history)
