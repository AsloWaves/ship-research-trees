ships_built: 0 (never started)
commissioned: Never
decommissioned: N/A
era: WWII (1940 planned)
generation: 8
type: Aircraft Carrier (Planned)

# Specifications (Planned - Similar to Flugzeugträger C)
displacement_standard: 30000 (estimated)
displacement_full: 35000 (estimated)
length_ft: 870 (estimated)
beam_ft: 120 (estimated)
draft_ft: 28 (estimated)
crew: 1800 (estimated)

# Performance (Planned)
speed_design: 34
propulsion_type: Steam turbines + 16 boilers
propulsion_hp: 210000 (estimated)
shafts: 4
range_nm: 8500

# Air Wing (Planned)
aircraft_capacity: 45
  fighters: 15× Bf 109T

secondary_guns: "12× 10.5cm SK C/33 AA guns"
aa_armament: "Enhanced AA armament" (planned)
armor_belt: 60-100mm
armor_deck: 60mm flight deck

# Plan Z Fleet Concept
plan_z_goal: 4-carrier fleet completion (Graf Zeppelin, Peter Strasser, C, D)
strategic_concept: Carrier groups for Atlantic/North Sea operations
operational_doctrine: Support for surface fleet, convoy interdiction
fleet_composition: Carriers + battleships (H-class) + cruisers + destroyers

# Cancellation Context
peter_strasser_scrapped: February 28, 1940 (ended Graf Zeppelin-class)
flugzeugtraeger_c_not_started: Construction never initiated
flugzeugtraeger_d_status: Never reached planning beyond concept
plan_z_collapse: WWII strategic priorities (U-boats, land forces)

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Flugzeugtraeger-C-Carrier]]"
successor: "[[Europa-Conversion-Carrier]]"
contemporary: Plan Z H-class battleships (also never built)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - FOURTH PLAN Z CARRIER! (final carrier in Plan Z fleet)
  - 4-carrier fleet goal (never realized!)
  - Similar specifications to Flugzeugträger C
  - 45 aircraft capacity
  - Dual-purpose design (16× 15cm guns)
  - Carrier group operations concept (strategic doctrine)
  - Atlantic/North Sea operations (planned role)
  - Support for H-class battleships (Plan Z synergy)
  - Convoy interdiction mission (Atlantic warfare)
  - Never reached detailed planning stage
  - Peter Strasser scrapping (Feb 1940) ended entire program
  - Plan Z collapsed with WWII strategic priorities
  - U-boat priority eliminated carrier development
  - NEVER BUILT! (never started, barely planned)

**Fourth Plan Z Carrier - Barely Planned!** - 0 boats: **FLUGZEUGTRÄGER D** - **Final carrier in Plan Z 4-carrier fleet!** Similar to Flugzeugträger C: **35,000 tons**, **34 kts**, **45 aircraft**, **16× 15cm guns** dual-purpose design. Plan Z envisioned complete carrier fleet (Graf Zeppelin, Peter Strasser, C, D) supporting surface fleet with H-class battleships. Strategic concept: carrier groups for **Atlantic/North Sea operations**, **convoy interdiction**, **fleet support**. Never reached detailed planning beyond concept. **Peter Strasser scrapping (February 28, 1940)** ended entire Graf Zeppelin-class program. **Plan Z collapsed** with WWII outbreak - strategic priorities shifted to U-boats and land forces. Flugzeugträger C and D never started construction. **NEVER BUILT** - barely planned beyond basic concept.
