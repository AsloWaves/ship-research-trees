# Plan Z Context
plan_z_goal: 4-carrier fleet (Graf Zeppelin, Peter Strasser, C, D)
strategic_role: Atlantic operations, convoy interdiction, fleet support
cancellation_reason: WWII outbreak (September 1939) prevented construction start
resource_priority: U-boat program received all resources

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Graf-Zeppelin-Carrier]]"
successor: "[[Flugzeugtraeger-D-Carrier]]"
contemporary: Plan Z battleships H-class (also never built)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - THIRD PLAN Z CARRIER! (planned but never started)
  - Improved Graf Zeppelin design incorporating lessons learned
  - 45 aircraft capacity (improved from 42!)
  - Enhanced AA armament (planned improvements)
  - Never started construction (WWII outbreak September 1939!)
  - Plan Z carrier fleet goal: 4 carriers total
  - Would have featured Graf Zeppelin construction experience
  - Better aircraft handling systems (planned)
  - Improved hangar organization (planned)
  - Atlantic operations role (convoy interdiction, fleet support)
  - Resources diverted to U-boat program instead
  - Part of ambitious Plan Z rearmament (never realized)
  - NEVER BUILT! (construction never began)

**Third Plan Z Carrier - Never Started!** - 0 boats: **FLUGZEUGTRÄGER C** - **Planned but never started!** Third carrier in Plan Z's ambitious 4-carrier fleet goal. Improved Graf Zeppelin design incorporating construction experience. **35,000 tons** (larger than Graf Zeppelin), **34 kts**, **45 aircraft** (improved from 42!), enhanced AA armament. Would have featured same **16× 15cm guns** dual-purpose design, 60mm armored flight deck. Planned for Atlantic operations, convoy interdiction, fleet support. **WWII outbreak (September 1939)** prevented construction start. Peter Strasser's scrapping (February 1940) and strategic priority shift to U-boats ended all Plan Z carrier development. **NEVER BUILT** - construction never began. Part of Plan Z rearmament program that was never realized.
