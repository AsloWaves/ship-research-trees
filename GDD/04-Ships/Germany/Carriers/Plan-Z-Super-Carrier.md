# Innovation
firsts:
  - ULTIMATE WWII CARRIER DESIGN! (maximum capability!)
  - "Ultimate Design" special ability (+50% capability, UNIQUE!)
  - 48,000 TONS! (LARGEST German carrier design!)
  - 60+ AIRCRAFT CAPACITY! (MAXIMUM!)
  - 950 ft length (LARGEST!)
  - 16× 15CM GUNS! (maximum dual-purpose armament!)
  - 150+ AA GUNS! (24× 10.5cm + 128× light AA!)
  - 3× CATAPULTS! (maximum launch rate!)
  - 3× elevators (optimized aircraft handling)
  - 10,000 nm range (maximum endurance!)
  - 34 knots (maximum speed!)
  - Balanced armor: 150mm belt + 100mm deck
  - Combines all German carrier development lessons
  - Graf Zeppelin dual-purpose concept (16× 15cm guns!)
  - British armored carrier survivability (100mm deck!)
  - Maximum operational capacity (60+ aircraft!)
  - Represents peak of German WWII carrier evolution
  - PAPER SHIP! (-25% reliability penalty, pure speculation!)
  - NEVER BUILT! (Germany never operated carriers)
  - Pure theoretical maximum development

**Ultimate WWII Carrier Design - 1945 Paper Ship!** - 0 boats: **PLAN Z SUPER CARRIER** - **Theoretical maximum WWII German carrier!** Represents peak of German carrier doctrine development. **48,000 tons** (LARGEST German design!), **34 kts**, **60+ aircraft** (MAXIMUM capacity!), **950 ft length**. **MAXIMUM DUAL-PURPOSE DESIGN**: **16× 15cm guns** (heaviest carrier armament!), **24× 10.5cm + 128× light AA = 150+ AA guns!** **3× catapults** (maximum launch rate!), **3× elevators** (optimized flow). Balanced armor: **150mm belt + 100mm flight deck** (protection + operations!). **10,000 nm range** (maximum endurance!). Combines all German carrier lessons: Graf Zeppelin dual-purpose concept + British armored survivability + maximum operational capacity. **PAPER SHIP** - pure speculation, never built. Germany never operated carriers. Represents theoretical maximum development if carrier program had continued. **NEVER BUILT!**
