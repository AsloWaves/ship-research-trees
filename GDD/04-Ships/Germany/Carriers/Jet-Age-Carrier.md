shafts: 4
range_nm: 14000

# Air Wing (Full Jet Capability)
aircraft_capacity: 55
  jet_fighters: 25× supersonic jet fighters (F-4 Phantom equivalent)
  jet_attack: 25× jet attack aircraft (A-4 Skyhawk equivalent)
  helicopters: 5× helicopters (ASW/utility)
flight_deck_length: 950 ft
angled_deck: 10° angled flight deck (REVOLUTIONARY!)
elevators: 4× aircraft elevators (deck-edge design!)
catapults: 4× STEAM CATAPULTS! (C-13 equivalent)

# Armament (Missile Age)
guns: None (full missile defense!)
missiles: "SAM missile systems" (Terrier/Tartar equivalent)
ciws: "Close-in weapons systems" (theoretical)
armor_belt: 60-100mm (reduced for speed)
armor_deck: 60mm flight deck

# Technology (1955 Advanced Systems)
flight_deck_design: ANGLED DECK! (10° angle, simultaneous launch/recovery!)
catapult_system: STEAM CATAPULTS! (C-13 equivalent, heavy jet capability!)
arresting_gear: Mk 7 equivalent (heavy jet aircraft)
optical_landing: Mirror landing system (British innovation!)
radar_systems: Advanced search/tracking radars (3D air search)
electronics: Early integrated combat systems
deck_edge_elevators: British-style deck-edge elevators (aircraft capacity!)

# Jet Age Innovations
angled_deck_benefit: Simultaneous launch and recovery operations!
steam_catapult_benefit: Launch heavy jet aircraft (30+ tons!)
mirror_landing_benefit: Precision landing for fast jets
deck_edge_elevators_benefit: More deck parking space
missile_defense: SAM systems replace gun armament

# Historical Reality
germany_status: No carrier program (focused on U-boats)
nato_carriers: US Forrestal-class (1955), British Eagle (1951)
cold_war_focus: Germany focused on land/air defense vs. Soviet threat
speculation_level: PURE SPECULATION (no German carrier development)

# Relationships
predecessor: "[[Post-War-Carrier]]"
successor: "[[Modern-Carrier]]"
contemporary: US Forrestal-class (1955), British Ark Royal (1955)

# Innovation
firsts:
  - JET AGE CARRIER CONCEPT! (1955 advanced design!)
  - ANGLED FLIGHT DECK! (10° angle, simultaneous ops!)
  - STEAM CATAPULTS! (4× C-13 equivalent, heavy jets!)
  - DECK-EDGE ELEVATORS! (British innovation, more parking!)
  - MIRROR LANDING SYSTEM! (precision jet landing!)
  - Full jet capability (supersonic fighters!)
  - 55 jet aircraft (F-4 Phantom + A-4 Skyhawk equivalent!)
  - SAM missile defense (Terrier/Tartar equivalent!)
  - No guns (full missile defense era!)
  - 62,000 tons (Cold War carrier size)
  - 4× steam catapults (maximum launch rate!)
  - Advanced 3D air search radar
  - Early integrated combat systems
  - PURE SPECULATION! (Germany had no carrier program!)
  - Cold War Germany focused on land/air defense (Soviet threat)
  - NATO carriers provided by US/Britain
  - THEORETICAL ONLY! (no plans, pure alternate history)
