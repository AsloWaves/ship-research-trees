**REVOLUTIONARY "Narvik" Class - 150mm Guns Change Destroyer Warfare!** - 8 ships commissioned 1940-1941: Z23, Z24, Z25, Z26, Z27, Z28, Z29, Z30. **Type 1936A "Narvik"** - **REVOLUTIONARY 4× 15cm (150mm) guns!** Only WWII destroyers with 150mm guns. **Cruiser-level firepower** (+40% over 127mm!). **Named after Battles of Narvik** (1940) where German destroyers fought heroically. 2,603 tons standard, **4× 15cm SK C/38 guns** (unprecedented!), **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 39 knots. **Changed destroyer warfare paradigm** - outgunned most Allied destroyers. Served entire WWII: **Arctic convoys**, Atlantic, Channel operations. **Several survived war**: French Navy operated survivors until 1958-1982! **Most famous German WWII destroyers** in history.

**Key Features:** REVOLUTIONARY 150mm guns! | Cruiser firepower (+40%!) | Type 1936A "Narvik" | 8 ships built | Named for Narvik battles | Largest German DD (2,603 tons) | Only DD with 150mm | Survived to 1982! | Most famous German DD

**Ships:** 8 ships (Z23-Z30, commissioned 1940-1941, heavy WWII combat Arctic/Atlantic/Channel, several survived: Z25/Z28/Z29/Z30 to French Navy 1945-1982!)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1940-1945), French Navy (1945-1982). WWII service (1940-1945): **Arctic convoy operations** (1942-1944 - attacked Allied convoys to Murmansk), **Battle of Barents Sea** (31 Dec 1942 - Z23/Z25 engaged HMS Sheffield/Jamaica), **Channel Dash** (1942 - several ships escorted Scharnhorst/Gneisenau), Atlantic operations, English Channel raids, Norway operations, mine-laying. **REVOLUTIONARY 150mm GUNS**: Only destroyers in WWII with 150mm (5.9-inch) main armament - cruiser-level firepower on destroyer hull. Could engage Allied destroyers and light cruisers on equal terms. Changed destroyer tactics and combat effectiveness. **Combat losses**: Z26 sunk 1942 (Arctic), Z27 sunk 1942 (Channel), Z23/Z24 sunk 1944 (air attack). **Survivors** Z25/Z28/Z29/Z30: Captured 1945, served French Navy as **Hoche, Marceau, Kleber, Desaix** until 1958-1982! Longest-serving WWII German destroyers. **Type 1936A "Narvik" legacy**: Most famous German WWII destroyers, proved 150mm guns viable on destroyers (though top-weight concerns), influenced postwar destroyer design worldwide.
