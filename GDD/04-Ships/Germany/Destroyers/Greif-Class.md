**Type 23 "Griffon" - Refined Bird Class** - Single ship commissioned 1927: **Greif** (Griffon). Type 23 "bird of prey" class, refined version of Möwe-class with lessons learned. Treaty-restricted "torpedo boat" (officially under 800 tons, **actually 924 tons**). 924 tons, **3× 10.5cm SK C/28 guns**, **6× 533mm torpedoes**, 33.8 knots. Slight improvements: better range (3,150 nm), improved turbine efficiency. **Named after mythical predator** (Griffon). Single ship class demonstrated continuous refinement of Type 23 design. Maintained German destroyer expertise during treaty period. Served entire WWII (1939-1945): Baltic Sea, convoy escort, mine-laying, Norway campaign. **Survived entire war**, decommissioned 1945.

**Key Features:** Type 23 refined (single ship) | Mythical bird name (Griffon) | Treaty restrictions exceeded (924 tons) | Improved range (3,150 nm) | Served entire WWII | War survivor | Decommissioned 1945

**Ships:** 1 ship (Greif, commissioned 1927, served entire WWII 1939-1945, survived war, decommissioned 1945)

**Service:** Reichsmarine (1927-1935), Kriegsmarine (1935-1945). Interwar training and operations (1927-1939). WWII service (1939-1945): Baltic Sea operations, convoy escort duties, mine-laying missions, anti-submarine patrols, **Norway campaign** (1940), North Sea patrols, English Channel operations, training duties for destroyer crews. Proved valuable for secondary operations throughout war despite limited combat capability compared to modern destroyers. **Survived entire war** demonstrating excellent construction quality and crew skill. Decommissioned 1945. Single ship class showed continuous refinement philosophy: each Type 23 ship incorporated lessons learned from previous vessels. **Greif** represented peak of Type 23 design before transition to Type 24 "predator" class. Maintained German destroyer design expertise and trained crews during treaty period, contributing to successful Nazi destroyer rearmament program 1933-1939.
