**Type 1936B - Return to Balanced 127mm Design** - 5 ships commissioned 1943: Z35, Z36, Z37, Z38, Z39. **Type 1936B** balanced design. **Returned to 127mm guns** (from 150mm Narvik) with **dual-purpose capability** (+30% AA). 2,527 tons standard, **5× 12.7cm SK C/41 DP guns**, **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 38.5 knots. **Lessons learned from Narvik**: Better stability, enhanced AA (14× 20mm), **radar-equipped standard**. Late war completion (1943), heavy combat losses (1944-1945). Balanced firepower vs. stability after 150mm top-weight issues.

**Key Features:** Type 1936B balanced | Return to 127mm (from 150mm) | Dual-purpose guns (+30% AA) | Radar standard | Enhanced AA (14× 20mm) | Better range (5,300 nm) | Late war (1943) | Most lost combat

**Ships:** 5 ships (Z35-Z39, commissioned 1943, late-war heavy combat, most lost 1944-1945: Z35/Z36/Z38 sunk, Z37/Z39 survived to scuttling)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1943-1945). WWII service (1943-1945): Late war Atlantic operations, English Channel operations, Baltic Sea operations, convoy escort, mine-laying, evacuation operations (East Prussia 1945). **Type 1936B philosophy**: Return to 127mm guns after Narvik experience showed 150mm caused stability problems. **Dual-purpose SK C/41 guns**: Balanced surface and AA capability, solved top-weight issues, maintained destroyer performance. Enhanced AA with 14× 20mm for defense against Allied air superiority. Radar-equipped as standard for improved fire control. **Combat losses**: Z35 sunk December 1944 (mine), Z36 sunk May 1945 (air attack), Z38 sunk May 1945 (mine). Survivors Z37/Z39 scuttled May 1945 to prevent capture. **Lessons learned**: Type 1936B represented German acknowledgment that 150mm guns were too heavy for destroyer hulls despite firepower advantage. Return to balanced 127mm dual-purpose design reflected combat experience and Allied destroyer development.
