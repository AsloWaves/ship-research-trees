**Type 1936 - 40 Knots, Improved Seakeeping** - 6 ships commissioned 1938-1939: Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Lüdemann, Z19 Hermann Künne, Z20 Karl Galster, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, Z22 Anton Schmitt. **Type 1936** (improved seakeeping design). **40 knots speed!** (fastest German destroyers yet). **Smaller than Type 1934A** (1,811 tons vs. 2,270 tons) but **better seakeeping**. Improved stability over Type 1934/34A. 5× 12.7cm guns, 8× 533mm torpedoes. Named after naval heroes. **Norway campaign 1940**: several ships lost at **Battles of Narvik** (Z17, Z18, Z19, Z21, Z22 sunk). **Last German destroyers with 127mm guns** before revolutionary Type 1936A "Narvik" class introduced 150mm guns.

**Key Features:** Type 1936 (improved) | 40 knots! (fastest yet) | Better seakeeping | Smaller (1,811 tons) | Improved stability | 6 ships built | Norway campaign | Several lost Narvik | Last 127mm guns

**Ships:** 6 ships (Z17-Z22, commissioned 1938-1939, heavy losses Narvik 1940: Z17/Z18/Z19/Z21/Z22 sunk, only Z20 survived to 1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1938-1946). WWII service (1939-1946): **Invasion of Norway** (April 1940), **First & Second Battles of Narvik** (10 & 13 April 1940 - **DEVASTATING LOSSES**: Z17 Diether von Roeder sunk by British cruisers, Z18 Hans Lüdemann scuttled, Z19 Hermann Künne sunk, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp sunk by British destroyers, Z22 Anton Schmitt sunk - **5 of 6 ships lost at Narvik!**). Only Z20 Karl Galster survived: Atlantic operations, English Channel, convoy escort, survived until 1945 (scuttled). **Type 1936** represented transitional design: smaller than Type 1934A but maintained 40-knot speed with better seakeeping through improved hull design. Improved stability over earlier types. **Narvik disaster** (83% class loss rate) demonstrated vulnerability of German destroyers to British firepower but ships performed well before losses. Last German destroyers with 127mm guns - Type 1936A "Narvik" class (Z23+) introduced revolutionary 150mm guns.
