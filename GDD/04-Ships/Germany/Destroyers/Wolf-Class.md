**Type 24 "Predators" - Improved Treaty Destroyers** - 2 ships commissioned 1928: **Wolf** (Wolf), Iltis (Polecat). First **Type 24** design, improved over Type 23 "birds." **Named after predators** (new naming convention). Treaty-restricted "torpedo boats" (**932 tons**, exceeded 800-ton limit). 932 tons, **3× 10.5cm SK C/28 guns**, **6× 533mm torpedoes**, **34.2 knots**. **Better range** (3,300 nm), **enhanced AA** (4× 20mm), improved turbines (23,500 SHP), better seakeeping. Maintained German destroyer expertise during treaty period. Served entire WWII (1939-1945): Baltic Sea, convoy escort, mine-laying, Norway campaign, North Sea operations. **Both ships survived entire war**, last decommissioned 1946. Demonstrated continued improvement of treaty-restricted designs.

**Key Features:** First Type 24 (improved) | Predator names (Wolf, Polecat) | 932 tons (larger) | Better range (3,300 nm) | Enhanced AA | Faster (34.2 knots) | Both survived WWII | Decommissioned 1946

**Ships:** 2 ships (Wolf, Iltis, commissioned 1928, served entire WWII 1939-1945, both survived war, decommissioned 1945-1946)

**Service:** Reichsmarine (1928-1935), Kriegsmarine (1935-1946). Interwar training and operations (1928-1939). WWII service (1939-1945): Baltic Sea operations, convoy escort duties, mine-laying missions, anti-submarine patrols, **Norway campaign** (1940), North Sea patrols, English Channel operations, training duties. Enhanced capabilities over Type 23: better range enabled longer patrols, improved AA proved valuable against Allied air attacks, better seakeeping allowed operations in worse weather. **Both ships survived entire war** demonstrating excellent construction and crew proficiency. Decommissioned 1945-1946. **Type 24** represented evolution from Type 23 "birds": larger size, better performance, enhanced AA, predator naming. Transition from birds to predators symbolized more aggressive design philosophy as Nazi rearmament approached. Maintained German destroyer design expertise and trained destroyer crews during final treaty period before unrestricted construction began 1933-1935.
