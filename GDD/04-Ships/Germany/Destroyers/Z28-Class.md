**Late Narvik - Ultimate 150mm Destroyers, All Survived!** - 3 ships commissioned 1941: Z28, Z29, Z30. **Type 1936A(Mob) "Late Narvik"** mobilization variant. **Ultimate 150mm destroyer design**. 2,620 tons standard, **4× 15cm SK C/38 guns**, **8× 533mm torpedoes**, **39.5 knots** (fastest Narvik!). **Enhanced AA** (12× 20mm!), **radar-equipped**, **best range** (5,200 nm), wider beam (39.7 ft) for better stability. Served WWII: Arctic convoys, Atlantic, Channel operations. **ALL THREE SHIPS SURVIVED WAR!** French Navy service as **Marceau (Z28), Kleber (Z29), Desaix (Z30)** until 1958-1982! **Longest-serving German WWII destroyers** - proved 150mm destroyer viability.

**Key Features:** Late Narvik ultimate | All survived war! (100%!) | Enhanced AA (12× 20mm) | Radar-equipped | Best range (5,200 nm) | Fastest (39.5 knots) | French Navy to 1982! | Longest-serving German DD | Proved 150mm concept

**Ships:** 3 ships (Z28/Z29/Z30, commissioned 1941, ALL survived WWII → French Navy as Marceau/Kleber/Desaix 1945-1982, longest-serving German WWII destroyers)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1941-1945), French Navy (1945-1982). WWII service (1941-1945): Arctic convoy operations (1942-1944), Atlantic raids, English Channel operations, Norway operations, convoy escort, mine-laying. **Type 1936A(Mob) improvements**: Enhanced AA capability (12× 20mm vs. 9× on Z25), radar integration for improved fire control and navigation, wider beam (39.7 ft) for better stability with 150mm guns, best range of all Narvik variants. **100% survival rate**: ALL THREE SHIPS survived WWII - remarkable for German destroyers! Captured 1945, allocated to France as war reparations. **French Navy service**: **Marceau** (ex-Z28, 1945-1958), **Kleber** (ex-Z29, 1945-1958), **Desaix** (ex-Z30, 1945-1982! LONGEST-SERVING). Desaix served 41 years total (1941-1982)! **Legacy**: Proved 150mm guns viable on destroyers despite top-weight concerns. Influenced postwar destroyer design worldwide. Last operational German WWII destroyers (Desaix until 1982). **Type 1936A "Narvik" ultimate** - represented peak of revolutionary 150mm destroyer concept before Type 1936B returned to 127mm guns.
