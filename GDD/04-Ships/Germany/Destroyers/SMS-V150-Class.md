**Advanced Torpedo Boat Design (1907) - 31.5 Knots** - 12 ships commissioned 1907-1908: V150-V161. Advanced torpedo boat with highest speed yet. 568 tons, 2× 5cm guns, 3× 45cm torpedoes, **31.5 knots** (fastest to date). Advanced steam turbines (9,600 SHP) provided excellent performance. Improved range (1,800 nm) for extended North Sea operations. Better seakeeping than earlier classes. 12 ships built (successful class). Served entire WWI (1914-1918): High Seas Fleet screening, Battle of Jutland (several ships), North Sea operations. Survivors scrapped 1919-1921 under Treaty of Versailles.

**Key Features:** Highest speed yet (31.5 knots) | Advanced turbines (9,600 SHP) | Improved range (1,800 nm) | 12 ships built | Battle of Jutland participants | Served entire WWI

**Ships:** 12 ships (V150-V161, commissioned 1907-1908, several Battle of Jutland participants, survivors scrapped 1919-1921)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1907-1921). High Seas Fleet screening, North Sea operations, torpedo attacks. WWI service (1914-1918): Continuous frontline service entire war, High Seas Fleet torpedo flotillas, **Battle of Jutland** (31 May 1916 - several ships engaged in night actions, torpedo attacks on British battlecruisers), North Sea patrols, mine-laying operations, night surface actions. Several losses from mines, submarine attacks, surface engagements during war. Survivors scrapped 1919-1921 under Treaty of Versailles. Last pre-1911 torpedo boat design, served entire WWI demonstrating excellent seakeeping and performance for North Sea combat conditions.
