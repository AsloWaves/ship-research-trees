**Type 1936C - 128mm Dual-Purpose, Never Completed** - 4 ships planned 1944: Z46, Z47, Z48, Z49. **Type 1936C** advanced late-war design. **Never completed** due to war's end. 2,657 tons standard, **4× 12.8cm SK C/41 DP guns** (balanced caliber between 127mm and 150mm), **8× 533mm torpedoes**, 39 knots (estimated). **Massive AA** (6× 37mm, 20× 20mm!), advanced radar fire control (planned). Represented **lessons learned** from WWII combat: balanced gun size, dual-purpose capability, heavy AA. **Ultimate German destroyer concept** - never realized.

**Key Features:** Type 1936C advanced | 128mm DP guns (balanced!) | Never completed | Massive AA (20× 20mm!) | Advanced radar planned | 4 ships planned | War ended | Ultimate concept | Lessons learned

**Ships:** 4 ships (Z46-Z49, never completed: Z46 30% complete, Z47-Z49 20-40% complete, all scuttled/captured 1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (never operational). **Never completed**: War ended during construction 1944-1945. Z46 launched but never commissioned. Z47-Z49 remained on slips. All scuttled or captured incomplete May 1945. **Type 1936C design philosophy**: **128mm dual-purpose guns** represented perfect balance - heavier than 127mm for surface combat, lighter than 150mm for stability, truly dual-purpose for AA. Fewer guns (4× vs. 5×) saved weight for massive AA battery. Advanced radar fire control planned for integrated AA defense. **Lessons learned synthesis**: Combined Type 1934A reliability, Type 1936 speed, Type 1936A firepower lessons, Type 1936B balance, with modern AA defense. **Ultimate German destroyer concept**: Would have been most capable German DD if completed - balanced surface/AA firepower, excellent speed, long range, heavy AA, radar integration. Represented culmination of German WWII destroyer development from Type 1934 (1937) through combat experience to 1944. Never tested in combat. **Historical significance**: Shows German destroyer design maturity despite war loss - understood balance requirements, dual-purpose necessity, AA priority.
