**Famous "Triple Kill" Submarine - Proved U-boat Effectiveness!** - Single boat commissioned 1910: U-9. **MOST FAMOUS WWI U-BOAT!** Achieved legendary **"Triple Kill" (22 September 1914)** - sank **3 British cruisers in 1 hour**: HMS Aboukir, HMS Hogue, HMS Cressy (1,459 British sailors killed). **Proved submarines could threaten major warships!** 493 tons surfaced, **4× 50cm torpedo tubes** (2 bow, 2 beam), 6 torpedoes carried, 14.2 knots surfaced/8.1 knots submerged. **Early diesel/electric** (safe!), double hull, 3,000 nm range. **+40% torpedo effectiveness** special ability. **FREE starting submarine**. Most famous U-boat in history.

**Key Features:** TRIPLE KILL legendary! | Sank 3 cruisers in 1 hour! | Early diesel/electric | Proved U-boat effectiveness | 493 tons | 6 torpedoes | +40% torpedo effectiveness | FREE starter | Most famous WWI U-boat

**Ships:** 1 boat (U-9, commissioned 1910, FAMOUS Triple Kill 1914, survived entire WWI, decommissioned 1919)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1910-1919). Pre-WWI service (1910-1914): Early diesel submarine testing safer diesel engines vs. dangerous gasoline (U-1). Double hull design improved seaworthiness. Established combat procedures for diesel U-boats. **WWI service** (1914-1918): **LEGENDARY "TRIPLE KILL"** (22 September 1914) - **most famous submarine action in history!** Commander Otto Weddigen commanded U-9 off Dutch coast. Torpedoed HMS Aboukir (armored cruiser, 12,000 tons) at 06:25. HMS Hogue stopped to rescue survivors - U-9 torpedoed Hogue at 06:55. HMS Cressy stopped to rescue both crews - U-9 torpedoed Cressy at 07:20. **All three cruisers sunk in 55 minutes!** 1,459 British sailors killed, only 837 survived. U-9 escaped undamaged. **Impact**: Proved submarines could sink major warships. Shocked Royal Navy - forced tactical changes, convoy systems, destroyer escorts. Validated German U-boat program. Weddigen became national hero (awarded Pour le Mérite). **Continued WWI service**: U-9 sank additional ships 1914-1915. Survived entire war despite obsolescence. Used for training 1916-1918. **Historical significance**: **Single most influential submarine action in history** - proved U-boat effectiveness, validated submarine warfare concept, forced Royal Navy tactical revolution. Inspired unrestricted submarine warfare campaign (1917-1918) that nearly starved Britain. **Legacy**: U-9 demonstrated submarines could threaten surface fleets. Led to massive WWI U-boat expansion (380 U-boats commissioned). Influenced WWII submarine warfare (Type VII dominated Atlantic). **Special ability**: +40% torpedo effectiveness reflects U-9's legendary accuracy and Weddigen's skill. **FREE starting submarine**: Players receive U-9 free alongside U-1 - learn submarine combat with historically proven boat before advancing to more complex U-boats.
