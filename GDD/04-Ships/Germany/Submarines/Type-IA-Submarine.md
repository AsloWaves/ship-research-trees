**First Post-Versailles Ocean-Going - Experimental Return** - 2 boats commissioned 1936: U-25, U-26. **FIRST POST-VERSAILLES OCEAN-GOING SUBMARINE!** Germany's return to submarine construction after Treaty of Versailles restrictions ended (1935). 862 tons surfaced, **6× 53.3cm torpedo tubes** (4 bow, 2 stern), **14 torpedoes carried**, 17.8 knots surfaced/8.3 knots submerged. 7,900 nm range (ocean-going), **1× 10.5cm SK C/32** + 1× 2cm Flak. **2 experimental boats** tested features for Type VII and Type IX development. Post-Versailles rearmament era. Both lost in combat 1940.

**Key Features:** First post-Versailles! | 2 experimental boats (U-25, U-26) | 862 tons (larger than WWI!) | 14 torpedoes (modern) | 6× 53.3cm tubes (WWII standard) | Tested features for Type VII/IX | 7,900 nm range | Rearmament era | Both lost 1940

**Ships:** 2 boats (U-25, U-26, commissioned 1936, experimental design, both lost in combat 1940)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1936-1940). Interwar/WWII service (1936-1940): **FIRST POST-VERSAILLES OCEAN-GOING SUBMARINE!** Type IA marked Germany's return to submarine construction after Treaty of Versailles restrictions ended in 1935. After 17-year ban (1918-1935), Germany secretly developed submarine technology through Dutch/Finnish front companies. Type IA was first openly-built ocean-going U-boat in new Kriegsmarine. **Experimental purpose**: Only 2 boats built (U-25, U-26) - purely experimental to test features for future production classes. Tested hull design, propulsion systems, torpedo tubes, diving characteristics, crew accommodations. Lessons learned directly influenced Type VII (709 boats!) and Type IX (194 boats) development. **Technical features**: 862 tons surfaced (larger than WWI U-93's 838 tons). 6× 53.3cm (21-inch) torpedo tubes (WWII standard, larger than WWI 50cm). 14 torpedoes carried (similar to U-93's 16). 10.5cm SK C/32 deck gun (modern design). 7,900 nm range enabled Atlantic operations. MAN diesel engines (3,200 HP) provided 17.8 knots surfaced speed. **Early WWII operations**: Both boats participated in early WWII operations (September 1939-1940). Atlantic convoy attacks, North Sea patrols, minelaying operations. Limited success due to experimental nature - crews reported handling problems, reliability issues, diving difficulties. Served as testbeds while newer Type VII/IX boats entered production. **Combat losses**: Both Type IA boats lost in combat 1940. **U-25** sunk August 1940 by British destroyers (Acheron, Antelope) off Norway - depth charged and rammed. **U-26** sunk July 1940 by British trawler (Phlox) with depth charges in Bay of Biscay. Short operational lives (4 years) reflected experimental status. **Historical significance**: **Critical transition point** - connected WWI U-boat expertise (U-93 ultimate design) to WWII mass production (Type VII/IX). Despite only 2 boats, Type IA provided essential testing for features that equipped 900+ submarines. **Legacy**: Type IA directly influenced Type VII and Type IX designs. Hull form, propulsion layout, torpedo tube arrangement, diving characteristics all tested on U-25/U-26 and incorporated into production boats. Without Type IA experimental phase, Type VII might have had serious design flaws when mass production began 1940-1944. Critical stepping stone in U-boat evolution.
