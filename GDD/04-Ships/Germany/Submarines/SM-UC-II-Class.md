**Advanced Minelayer "Mine+Torpedo" - 64 Boats!** - 64 boats commissioned 1916-1917: UC-16 to UC-79. **IDEAL MINELAYER!** **64 BOATS BUILT!** (largest minelayer class!). 417 tons surfaced, **3× 50cm torpedo tubes**, **7 torpedoes carried**, **18× UC/200 mines** (6× vertical chutes, 3 mines each!), 11.6 knots surfaced/7.0 knots submerged. **"Mine+Torpedo" special ability** (+35% versatility, UNIQUE!). **Could lay minefields AND attack shipping on same patrol!** 1× 8.8cm deck gun, **9,400 nm range** (12× UC-I!). Revolutionary combined capability. Port blocking + convoy attacks. Mediterranean/North Sea dominance.

**Key Features:** 64 BOATS! (largest minelayer class!) | Mine+Torpedo (+35% versatility UNIQUE!) | 18 mines + 7 torpedoes! | Ideal combination | 9,400 nm range (12× UC-I!) | 417 tons (2.5× UC-I) | Combined capability | Port blocking + attacks

**Ships:** 64 boats (UC-16 to UC-79, commissioned 1916-1917, WWI combined mine-torpedo operations, heavy combat losses, few survivors scrapped 1920)

**Service:** Kaiserliche Marine (1916-1920). WWI service (1916-1918): **IDEAL MINELAYER DESIGN!** 64 UC-II boats built 1916-1917 - largest minelayer class in history. Proved optimal minelayer design by combining UC-I mine-laying with torpedo attack capability. **"Mine+Torpedo" revolutionary**: +35% versatility special ability reflects UC-II's unprecedented combined capability. Could lay 18-mine minefields off British ports, then attack passing convoys with 7 torpedoes on SAME PATROL. Eliminated UC-I limitation (mines only, no self-defense). **Doubled capability**: 18× mines (vs. UC-I 12×) in 6 vertical chutes (3 mines per chute). Plus 7× torpedoes (UC-I: NONE!) for attacking warships/merchants directly. Plus 8.8cm deck gun for surface attacks. Triple threat weapon system. **Extended operations**: 9,400 nm range (UC-I: 780 nm - 12× improvement!). Could operate entire North Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic coastal areas. 417 tons surfaced (2.5× UC-I 168 tons). Larger crew (26 vs. 14) enabled longer patrols. **Combined warfare mastery**: Typical UC-II patrol - sail to British port approaches, lay 18-mine minefield while submerged (mines sink Allied ships for weeks), then hunt convoys with torpedoes, surface attack stragglers with deck gun. One submarine, three attack methods, devastating effectiveness. **Mediterranean dominance**: UC-16 to UC-40 deployed Mediterranean/Adriatic. Controlled shipping lanes with minefields + torpedo attacks. UC-25 sank 55 ships (113,630 tons)! Forced Allies to deploy massive minesweeping + ASW resources. **North Sea/English Channel**: UC-41 to UC-79 operated from Flanders bases (Bruges/Zeebrugge). Laid thousands of mines off British ports (Thames, Dover, Portsmouth, Scapa Flow). Attacked coastal convoys with torpedoes. **Combat losses**: Heavy losses 1916-1918 as Allied ASW improved. Approximately 46 of 64 UC-II lost! Mines, depth charges, ramming, net entanglement, Q-ships. UC-19 sunk February 1917 (mine). UC-44 sunk August 1917 (depth charge). UC-61 survived war with excellent record. **Historical significance**: **Ideal minelayer proved concept** - combining mines and torpedoes on same platform maximized effectiveness. 64 boats demonstrated concept's success. Influenced all future minelaying submarines. **Legacy**: UC-II directly influenced UC-III ultimate design. WWII Type VIID minelayers (6 boats) used similar combined mine-torpedo concept. Modern minelaying submarines (Oscar-II, etc.) trace lineage to UC-II innovation. "Mine+Torpedo" +35% versatility UNIQUE to UC-II!
