**Post-War Concept - Theoretical Only!** - 0 boats: **POST-WAR ELEKTROBOOT CONCEPT!** **25 KNOTS SUBMERGED!** **32 torpedoes**, **22,000 nm range**, **650 ft depth**. Advanced batteries, computer systems. **THEORETICAL ONLY** - never designed (Germany occupied post-war). Nuclear submarines made concept obsolete.
