**Final Type II - Maximum Range (16 Boats!)** - 16 boats commissioned 1940-1941: U-137 to U-152. **FINAL TYPE II VARIANT!** Culmination of Type II evolution. 314 tons surfaced (largest Type II!), **3× 53.3cm torpedo tubes** (all bow), 5 torpedoes carried, 12.7 knots surfaced/7.4 knots submerged. **5,650 nm range** (MAXIMUM Type II - IIA: 1,600, IIB: 3,100, IIC: 3,800, IID: 5,650!), **widest beam 16.4 ft** (improved stability), 1× 2cm Flak. **Ultimate coastal submarine capability**. Training + combat missions. Optimized hull design. 16 boats built during wartime.

**Key Features:** Final Type II! | 16 boats (U-137 to U-152) | 5,650 nm range (MAXIMUM!) | 314 tons (largest Type II) | Widest beam (16.4 ft) | Ultimate capability | Culmination of evolution | 1940-1941 wartime | Training + combat

**Ships:** 16 boats (U-137 to U-152, commissioned 1940-1941, training and combat operations, heavy losses 1944-1945)

**Service:** Kriegsmarine (1940-1945). WWII service (1940-1945): **FINAL TYPE II VARIANT!** Type IID represented culmination of 5-year Type II evolution (IIA 1935 → IIB 1936 → IIC 1938 → IID 1940). 16 boats built 1940-1941 during wartime as Germany perfected coastal submarine design. **Maximum range achievement**: **5,650 nm range** - MAXIMUM among all Type II variants! Progressive improvements: IIA 1,600 nm → IIB 3,100 nm → IIC 3,800 nm → IID 5,650 nm (3.5× IIA!). Range nearly matched ocean-going Type IA (7,900 nm) despite coastal size. Enabled extended training patrols and longer combat missions. **Optimized design features**: 314 tons surfaced (largest Type II - 23% larger than IIA 254 tons). **Widest beam 16.4 ft** (vs. IIA/IIB/IIC 13.3-13.5 ft) - improved stability for training operations. Longer hull (145.7 ft vs. IIA 134.5 ft) accommodated additional fuel tanks. Same crew (25), same armament (3 tubes, 5 torpedoes), same propulsion (700 HP diesel). **Wartime construction**: Unlike pre-war IIA/IIB/IIC, Type IID built during WWII (1940-1941). Germany still valued coastal training boats despite Type VII/IX mass production. 16 boats demonstrated continued commitment to crew training quality. **Combat + training missions**: Baltic training schools primary mission - trained thousands of crews for Type VII/IX boats. Some combat operations: Black Sea after 1941 (transported overland!), Baltic anti-Soviet patrols 1941-1945, coastal defense Norway. Limited frontline effectiveness due to small size, but training value critical. **Combat losses**: Heavy losses late-war as Allied ASW improved. 12 of 16 Type IID lost 1944-1945! U-137 sunk July 1943 (mine, Baltic). U-145 sunk April 1945 (aircraft, Bay of Biscay). U-140, U-141, U-149, U-150 survived war, scrapped 1945-1946. **Historical significance**: **Ultimate expression of coastal training submarine** - Type IID proved coastal boats still valuable despite larger ocean-going types dominating. 5,650 nm range enabled realistic long-duration training patrols. Trained core of late-war U-boat crews when experienced veterans depleted. **Type II family legacy**: Total 50 Type II boats (IIA: 6, IIB: 20, IIC: 8, IID: 16) trained majority of WWII U-boat force. Type IID's optimized design showed what coastal submarines could achieve with systematic evolution. Influenced post-war training submarine designs worldwide. German navy post-war continued using small coastal boats for training (Type 205, 206).
