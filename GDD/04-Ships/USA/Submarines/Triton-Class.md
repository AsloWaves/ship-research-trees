**Giant Radar Picket** - Triton (SSN-586) was largest submarine until Ohio-class. Only SSN with two reactors. Built as radar picket for carrier groups.

**Key Specs:** 5940/7780 tons | 447ft | 27/20+ kn | 6× 21" tubes | 2× S4G reactors | 1 boat (Triton SSN-586)

**Innovation:** Largest submarine for decades. Two nuclear reactors. Designed as radar picket. First submerged circumnavigation of Earth (1960, 83 days, "Operation Sandblast").

**Service:** Radar picket role proved unnecessary. Converted to attack submarine 1962. Short service life, decommissioned 1969.
