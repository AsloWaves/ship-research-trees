**Modern Amphibious Transports** - San Antonio-class are most modern and capable amphibious transport docks. 11 commissioned, 13 planned. Replaced Austin-class. Advanced stealth features and C4ISR systems.

**Key Specs:** 24,900/25,300 tons | 684ft | 22+ kn | 4 helos or 2 MV-22 | 2 LCAC | 720 Marines | Stealth features | 11+ ships

**Innovation:** First amphibious ships with stealth features - reduced radar cross-section, composite materials. Advanced command and control (C4ISR). Automated systems reduce crew. Modern self-defense. Can serve as flagship for amphibious squadron.

**Design:** Well deck aft for 2 LCAC or 1 LCU plus smaller craft. Flight deck for 4 helicopters or 2 MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors. Vehicle/cargo deck. Stealth tumblehome hull. Composite deckhouse and mast. Automated cargo handling.

**Ships Commissioned:**
- **San Antonio (LPD-17)** - 2006
- **New Orleans (LPD-18)** - 2007
- **Mesa Verde (LPD-19)** - 2007
- **Green Bay (LPD-20)** - 2009
- **New York (LPD-21)** - 2010 (contains 7.5 tons steel from World Trade Center)
- **San Diego (LPD-22)** - 2012
- **Anchorage (LPD-23)** - 2013
- **Arlington (LPD-24)** - 2013 (named for Pentagon 9/11)
- **Somerset (LPD-25)** - 2014 (named for Flight 93)
- **John P. Murtha (LPD-26)** - 2017
- **Portland (LPD-27)** - 2018

- **Landing Craft:** 2 LCAC hovercraft or 1 LCU plus smaller boats
- **Vehicles:** 14 AAV or LCAC in well deck plus 34+ vehicles on vehicle deck
- **Marines:** 720 embarked troops (surge to 800)
- **Cargo:** 24,000 sq ft vehicle space, cargo handling systems

**Advanced Systems:**
- **Stealth:** Reduced radar cross-section, tumblehome hull
- **C4ISR:** Advanced command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance
- **Self-Defense:** RAM missiles, Phalanx CIWS, electronic warfare
- **Automation:** Reduced crew through automated systems

**Service:** Afghanistan/Iraq operations. Counter-piracy. Humanitarian missions. Forward presence operations. LPD-21 New York contains steel from World Trade Center - symbolic of 9/11 response.

**Program Issues:** Early ships had mechanical and electrical problems. Later ships incorporated fixes. Program eventually stabilized.
