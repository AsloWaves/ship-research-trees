**Devastating Rocket Ships** - LSM(R)-188-class were rocket-armed fire support conversions from LSM-1 hulls. 12 ships (LSM(R)-188 to LSM(R)-199) converted late 1944. Each mounted 75-85 automatic rocket launchers. Life Magazine: firepower "greater than two Iowa-class battleships combined" at close range.

**Key Specs:** 520/1,100 tons | 203.5ft | 13.2 kn | 75-85 rocket launchers + 5"/38 gun | 12 ships

**Conversion Design:** Radical conversion of LSM-1 hulls into shore bombardment platforms. Cargo hold converted to rocket magazine and launcher platform. Bow doors removed, eliminating beaching capability. Deck reinforced for rocket launcher weight. Fire control system added for rocket barrage coordination. Crew increased from 58 to 77 (additional 19 for rocket operations). Total conversion time: approximately 1 month per ship.

**Rocket Armament:** Two configurations deployed:
- **LSM(R)-188 to LSM(R)-195**: 75× Mk 36 automatic rocket launchers (originally planned with 30× Mk 30 launchers, later standardized to 75× Mk 36 only)
- **LSM(R)-196 to LSM(R)-199**: 85× Mk 51 automatic rocket launchers

All ships also received:
- 1× 5-inch/38 cal DP gun (stern turret, added for direct fire support)
- 2× twin 40mm Bofors AA (enhanced from single 40mm on standard LSM)
- 3× single 20mm Oerlikon AA (reduced from 4 to accommodate rocket systems)

**Firepower Assessment:** Life Magazine featured LSM(R)s in April 16, 1945 issue, describing their firepower as "greater than two Iowa-class battleships combined" when delivering massed rocket salvos at close range. 75-85 launchers could deliver devastating saturation barrage in seconds. Rockets designed for area suppression of beach defenses, pillboxes, and troop concentrations. Effective against soft targets and personnel within 50-yard radius of impact point.

**Tactical Doctrine:** Close-in shore bombardment platform. Approach beach at short range (1,000-3,000 yards), unleash massive rocket barrage, retire before counter-fire could be organized. Coordinated with assault waves - fired preparatory bombardment immediately before troops landed. Suppression capability neutralized beach defenses for critical minutes during landing. Operated alongside standard LSMs in assault formations.

**Ships:** USS LSM(R)-188 (lead ship), USS LSM(R)-189, USS LSM(R)-190, USS LSM(R)-191, USS LSM(R)-192, USS LSM(R)-193, USS LSM(R)-194, USS LSM(R)-195, USS LSM(R)-196, USS LSM(R)-197, USS LSM(R)-198, USS LSM(R)-199. First conversion (LSM(R)-188) completed November 11, 1944.

**Combat Record:** First combat action: March 26, 1945, dawn rocket barrage on Kerama Retto islands. Six LSM(R)s participated in April 1, 1945 Okinawa invasion preparatory bombardment. USS LSM(R)-188 hit by kamikaze March 28, 1945, suffering 15 killed and 32 wounded, ending her combat career. Several ships lost to kamikaze attacks May 1945 during Okinawa campaign. Vulnerability to air attack remained critical weakness - unarmored hulls with ammunition magazines made them high-value kamikaze targets.

**Korean War Reactivation:** Several ships reactivated 1950-1956 under LSMR (Landing Ship Medium Rocket) designation. Examples include LSMR-527 and LSMR-536 (USS White River). Updated rocket systems installed on some ships. Continued fire support role for amphibious operations. USS White River (LSMR-536) served through Vietnam War (1965-1970), demonstrating enduring value of rocket fire support concept.

**Foreign Service:** Some LSM(R) hulls transferred to allied navies post-war. Several converted back to cargo configuration after rocket systems removed. Others scrapped late 1940s after brief combat careers.

**Operational Assessment:** Demonstrated devastating effectiveness of concentrated rocket fire for beach suppression. Saturation barrage capability suppressed defensive positions during critical assault phase. Close-in approach doctrine proved viable but risky. Vulnerability to kamikaze attacks exposed inherent danger of ammunition-laden unarmored hulls. Cost-effectiveness excellent - conversions provided battleship-level firepower at fraction of cost. Korean War and Vietnam reactivation validated concept for three decades.

**Legacy:** Proved shore bombardment value of massed rocket fire from small, inexpensive platforms. Influenced post-war fire support ship designs. Demonstrated that LSM hulls could support diverse mission conversions beyond cargo transport. Korean War LSMR conversions and Vietnam service extended operational concept across multiple conflicts. Despite vulnerability, tactical effectiveness justified deployment at Okinawa and later campaigns.
