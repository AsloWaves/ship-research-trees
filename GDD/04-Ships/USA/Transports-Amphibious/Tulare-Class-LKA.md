**Mariner Conversion** - USS Tulare was unique single-ship class converted from Mariner-type commercial hull. Solo ship. Larger and faster than WWII-era C2 conversions.

**Key Specs:** 9,050-9,190/15,970-16,000 tons | 564ft | 21 kn | Mariner C4-S-A1 hull | Solo ship

**Design:** Converted from Mariner-class merchant hull (MA hull 32, originally "Evergreen Mariner"). Maritime Administration C4-S-A1 type. Single-screw geared steam turbines (22,000 SHP) provided 21-knot maximum, 20-knot continuous speed. Larger and faster than WWII C2 conversions. Two high-pressure boilers (600 psi / 875°F).

**Ship:**
- **USS Tulare (AKA-112/LKA-112)** - Laid down February 16, 1953 at Bethlehem Pacific Coast Steel Corp., San Francisco. Converted during construction. Delivered January 10, 1956, commissioned January 12, 1956. Redesignated LKA-112 on January 1, 1969. Decommissioned 1986 after 30 years service.

**Service:** Sole Mariner-class conversion to attack/amphibious cargo ship. Served Cold War amphibious operations 1956-1986. Crew of 435 (39 officers, 396 enlisted) plus 322 troops. Carried landing craft for ship-to-shore operations. Armament reduced in 1959 from 6× 3-inch/50 + 6× 20mm to 6× 3-inch/50 only.

**Construction History:** Originally contracted as Mariner-class merchant ship. Converted to AKA during construction at building yard. Demonstrated feasibility of converting modern commercial Mariner hulls to amphibious cargo use. More expensive than mass-produced C2 conversions, explaining single-ship production.

**Legacy:** Unique experiment in using modern high-speed merchant hull for amphibious cargo role. Performance advantages (21 knots vs 16.5 knots for C2 types) offset by higher cost. Led to Charleston-class purpose-built LKAs with similar speed but optimized military design. Bridge between WWII conversions and modern purpose-built amphibious cargo ships.
