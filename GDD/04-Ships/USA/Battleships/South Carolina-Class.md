**First US Dreadnoughts** - South Carolina-class were first US dreadnought battleships. 2 ships. All-big-gun armament with superfiring turrets. Design predated HMS Dreadnought but commissioned later.

**Key Specs:** 16,000/17,617 tons | 453ft | 18.5/19 kn | 8× 12" guns | First US dreadnoughts | Superfiring turrets

**Innovation:** First US all-big-gun battleships. Eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets - superfiring arrangement (turrets stacked). Uniform main battery - no intermediate caliber. Design actually predated HMS Dreadnought (1906) but built more slowly.

**Design:** Superfiring turrets fore and aft - revolutionary at time. All 12-inch main battery. Light secondary armament (3-inch AA). Coal-fired with reciprocating engines (not turbines like Dreadnought). Compact design.

**Ships:**
- **South Carolina (BB-26)**
- **Michigan (BB-27)**

**Service:** WWI convoy escort and training. Never saw combat. Made obsolete quickly by faster 14-inch gun ships. Decommissioned 1921-1923. Scrapped under Washington Naval Treaty.

**Legacy:** Marked US entry into dreadnought era. Superfiring turret arrangement became standard. Proved all-big-gun concept.
