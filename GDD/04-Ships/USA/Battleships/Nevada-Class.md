**Revolutionary Design** - Nevada-class introduced revolutionary all-or-nothing armor scheme and oil-fired propulsion. 2 ships. Triple turrets. Nevada sole survivor of Pearl Harbor battleship row.

**Key Specs:** 27,500/29,000 tons | 583ft | 20.5 kn | 10× 14" guns | All-or-nothing armor | Oil-fired | Triple turrets

**Innovation:** Revolutionary all-or-nothing armor - thick belt and deck armor, minimal elsewhere. First US oil-fired battleships. World's first triple gun turrets (2× triple, 2× twin 14-inch). More economical design allowing heavier armor.

**Design:** Triple and twin 14-inch turrets. All-or-nothing armor scheme concentrated protection on vitals. Oil-fired boilers. Nevada had mixed turbine/reciprocating engines (last US capital ship with reciprocating). Oklahoma all-turbine.

**Ships:**
- **Nevada (BB-36)** - Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, atomic test, target 1948
- **Oklahoma (BB-37)** - Capsized Pearl Harbor December 1941, raised, scrapped 1947

**Service:** Pearl Harbor attack December 7, 1941. Oklahoma capsized with heavy loss of life (429 killed). Nevada only battleship to get underway, beached to prevent sinking. Nevada modernized, served entire war - Normandy, Iwo Jima, Okinawa. Survived two atomic tests Bikini Atoll 1946. Sunk as target 1948.

**Legacy:** All-or-nothing armor became standard for all future battleships worldwide. Triple turrets used by many navies.
