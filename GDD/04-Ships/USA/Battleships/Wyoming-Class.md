**Maximum 12-Inch Armament** - Wyoming-class carried most 12-inch guns of any US battleship with 12 total. 2 ships. Last US battleships with 12-inch main battery before switch to 14-inch guns.

**Key Specs:** 26,000/27,243 tons | 562ft | 20.5 kn | 12× 12"/50 (6 twin turrets) | 11" belt | 2 ships

**Innovation:** Peak of 12-inch gun battleship development. Six twin turrets (3 superfiring forward, 3 aft) maximized broadside firepower. Longer 50-caliber guns improved range and accuracy over earlier 45-caliber weapons. Last US dreadnoughts before adoption of larger 14-inch guns.

**Ships:**
- **Wyoming (BB-32)** - Commissioned Sept 25, 1912, disarmed 1931 for London Naval Treaty compliance, converted to training ship (AG-17), decommissioned Aug 1, 1947
- **Arkansas (BB-33)** - Commissioned Sept 17, 1912, modernized 1925-1927, decommissioned July 29, 1946, sunk by atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll July 25, 1946

**Service:** WWI convoy escort. Arkansas extensively modernized 1925-1927, served entire WWII. Provided gunfire support at Normandy (June 1944), Iwo Jima (Feb 1945), and Okinawa (Apr-June 1945). Survived Operation Crossroads Test Able (July 1, 1946), sank during Test Baker (July 25, 1946).

**Design:** Reciprocating turbo-generators provided electrical power. Six centerline turrets with superfiring arrangement. Wyoming disarmed 1931 per London Naval Treaty limits, served as gunnery training ship remainder of career.

**Legacy:** Arkansas notable for extensive WWII service and participation in atomic bomb tests. Wyoming important for training thousands of naval gunners. Last of the 12-inch gun era before US Navy standardized on larger calibers.
