**Largest Class Ever** - Casablanca-class were largest aircraft carrier class in history. 50 ships built 1943-1944. Purpose-built escort carriers using Kaiser mass-production techniques.

**Key Specs:** 7,800/10,400 tons | 512ft | 19 kn | 27-28 aircraft | 9,000 shp | 1× 5"/38 DP

**Innovation:** Purpose-designed escort carrier. Kaiser shipyard mass production - one ship every 5 days at peak! Steam turbine propulsion. Twin screws. Faster than Bogue-class. Standardized design allowed rapid construction. 50 ships built - largest class of any aircraft carrier ever.

**Design:** Purpose-built hull optimized for carrier operations. Better than converted merchants. Adequate speed for fleet operations. Good sea-keeping. Reliable machinery. Flight deck 477ft. Hydraulic catapult.

**Famous Ships:**
- **Gambier Bay (CVE-73)** - Only US carrier sunk by surface gunfire (Battle off Samar 1944)
- **St. Lo (CVE-63)** - First ship sunk by kamikaze attack (Leyte Gulf 1944)
- **Liscome Bay (CVE-56)** - Sunk by submarine 1943

**Service:** Pacific War 1943-1945. Invasion support, CAP, ASW. Battle of Leyte Gulf - "Taffy 3" heroic action off Samar. Atlantic convoy escort. Kamikaze attacks late war. 6 lost in combat. Most scrapped 1946-1960. Several served into 1950s.
