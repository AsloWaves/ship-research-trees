**Ultimate CVE** - Commencement Bay-class were ultimate escort carrier design. 19 ships completed 1944-1946 (16 cancelled). Largest, fastest, and most capable CVEs. Many served through Korean and Vietnam Wars.

**Key Specs:** 11,373/21,397 tons | 557ft | 19 kn | 33-34 aircraft | 16,000 shp | 2× 5"/38 DP

**Innovation:** Improved CVE design incorporating lessons from earlier classes. Larger hull, better sea-keeping, improved protection. Heavier armament. Greater range (23,900 nm). Stronger flight deck. Better aviation facilities. Ultimate refinement of escort carrier concept.

**Design:** Purpose-built T3 tanker hull. Much larger than Casablanca. Better speed, range, capacity. Two-shaft geared turbines. Hydraulic catapult. Two elevators. Enhanced AA armament. Improved crew accommodations.

**Service:** Few saw WWII combat (commissioned late). Korean War 1950-1953 - ASW, transport, training. Some converted to helicopter carriers (CVHA), auxiliary aircraft transports (AKV), or communications ships (AKVE). Last CVE in service (USS Annapolis) decommissioned 1970. Longest-serving escort carriers.

**Conversions:**
- **Thetis Bay (CVHA-1)** - First helicopter assault carrier 1956
- Several to AKV (aircraft ferry)
- Several to T-AKV (military sealift command)
