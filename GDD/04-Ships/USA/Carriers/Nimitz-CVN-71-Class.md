**Improved Nimitz** - CVN-71+ subclass represents improved Nimitz design. 5 ships commissioned 1986-1998. Enhanced electronics, improved crew facilities, refined design. Currently active fleet.

**Key Specs:** 97,000/106,300 tons | 1,092ft | 30+ kn | 85-90 aircraft | 260,000 shp | 2× A4W reactors

**Innovation:** Improved Nimitz design incorporating lessons from first three ships (CVN-68/69/70). Enhanced combat systems. Improved radar suite. Better crew habitability. Refined hull design. Enhanced aircraft maintenance facilities. Improved damage control systems.

**Improvements Over CVN-68-70:**
- SPS-48E 3D air search radar
- SPS-49(V)5 2D radar
- Improved combat direction systems
- Enhanced crew quarters
- Better aircraft maintenance shops
- Refined propulsion plant layout
- Improved damage control
- Enhanced communications suite

**Ships:**
- **CVN-71 Theodore Roosevelt** (1986)
- **CVN-72 Abraham Lincoln** (1989)
- **CVN-73 George Washington** (1992)
- **CVN-74 John C. Stennis** (1995)
- **CVN-75 Harry S. Truman** (1998)

**Service:** Gulf War. Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan). Operation Iraqi Freedom. Global War on Terror. Currently active worldwide deployments. Expected service life 50 years (to 2030s-2040s).

**Significance:** Refined Nimitz design perfected nuclear carrier concept. Bridge between original Nimitz and Ford-class. Most numerous currently active carrier variant.
