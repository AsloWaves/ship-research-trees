**Modified Baltimore-Class** - Oregon City-class were improved Baltimores with single funnel, revised superstructure. Only 4 of 10 ordered completed.

**Key Specs:** 13,600t | 673ft | 33kn | Same armament as Baltimore | 4 ships (Oregon City, Albany, Rochester, Northampton)

**vs [[Baltimore-Class]]:** Single funnel vs two | Revised superstructure | Otherwise nearly identical
