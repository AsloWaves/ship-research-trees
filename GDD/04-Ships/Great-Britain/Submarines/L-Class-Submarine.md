# L-Class Submarines (1917-1919)

## Overview
The L-class were improved fleet submarines with 34 boats built 1917-1919. They combined the best features of earlier classes with lessons from WWI combat, becoming the RN's standard fleet submarine by war's end. The class saw limited WWI service but extensive interwar operations, with several serving into WWII. Many were transferred to foreign navies.

- Improved diving characteristics
- Reliable and proven

**Key Features:**
- Six 21-inch torpedo tubes
- Good surface speed (17 knots)
- Enhanced habitability
- Proven diesel-electric
- Fleet operations capable

**Design Philosophy:**
- Avoid K-class complexity
- Proven diesel propulsion
- Balanced capabilities
- Mass production suitable
- Combat experience incorporated

## Boats by Groups

**L1-L33:** Commissioned 1918-1919
**L50-L71:** Post-war builds, mostly cancelled
- L50-L54 completed
- Others cancelled 1919-1920

## WWI Service

**Limited War Service:**
- Most commissioned late 1918
- Post-armistice arrivals
- Some saw brief combat
- Training operations
- Fleet duties

## Interwar Service

**Extensive Peacetime Operations:**
- Mediterranean Fleet
- Far East deployments
- Home Fleet
- Training duties
- Modernization trials

**Foreign Transfers:**
- Royal Australian Navy (L6 → HMAS Otway)

- Extended foreign service
- 1920s-1930s transfers

## WWII Service

**Several Survived to WWII:**
- Home waters patrols
- Training duties
- Defensive operations
- Obsolescent by 1939
- Some saw limited combat

## Losses

**Moderate Casualties: ~12 of 34 lost:**

**WWI/Interwar:**
- L10 - Lost 1918
- L24 - Sunk by German submarine, 1924
