# D-Class Submarines (1908-1911)

## Overview
The D-class were the first diesel-powered submarines in the Royal Navy, with 8 boats built 1908-1911. They represented a revolutionary transition from dangerous petrol engines to reliable diesel propulsion, establishing the diesel-electric submarine standard that would persist for decades. The class saw extensive WWI service with moderate losses.
