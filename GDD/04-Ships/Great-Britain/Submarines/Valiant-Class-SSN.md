# Valiant-Class Nuclear Submarines (1963-1971)

## Overview
The Valiant-class were nuclear-powered attack submarines with 5 boats built 1963-1971. They were the first British SSNs with indigenous British nuclear reactors (PWR1), achieving technological independence from the United States. The class served successfully through the Cold War and saw combat in the Falklands War, with HMS Conqueror achieving the only submarine torpedo sinking since WWII.

## Design

**First British-Reactor SSNs:**
- Indigenous Rolls-Royce PWR1 reactor
- Technological independence achieved
- Improved over Dreadnought
- Proven hull design
- Cold War hunter-killers

**Key Features:**
- British PWR1 nuclear reactor
- 28+ knots submerged
- Unlimited endurance
- Heavy torpedo armament
- Advanced sensors

**Design Philosophy:**
- British reactor independence
- Cold War ASW role
- Soviet submarine hunter
- Strategic deterrent protection
- Arctic capability

## Boats

1. **Valiant** (S102) - 1966
2. **Warspite** (S103) - 1967
3. **Churchill** (S104) - 1970 (later became Churchill-class lead)
4. **Conqueror** (S105) - 1971
5. **Courageous** (S106) - 1971 (later became Churchill-class)

**Note:** Churchill and Courageous were later reclassified as Churchill-class due to minor differences, but were essentially Valiant-class boats.

## Service History

**Cold War Operations:**
- Arctic patrols
- Soviet submarine tracking
- Atlantic operations
- Mediterranean deployments
- Intelligence gathering

**Falklands War (1982):**
- **HMS Conqueror** - Legendary combat action
  - Deployed to South Atlantic
  - Sank ARA General Belgrano, May 2, 1982
  - First submarine torpedo sinking since WWII
  - Tigerfish torpedoes used
  - Only nuclear submarine combat sinking
  - Strategic impact (Argentine fleet withdrew)

**Special Operations:**
- Covert reconnaissance
- Special forces support
- Electronic intelligence
- NATO exercises
- Training operations

## HMS Conqueror Legacy

**Historic Achievement:**
- Only submarine to sink warship since WWII
- Only nuclear submarine combat kill
- Sank Argentine cruiser ARA General Belgrano
- 323 Argentine sailors killed
- Controversial but strategically decisive
- Flew Jolly Roger on return (submarine tradition)

**Weapon Used:**
- Two Mk 8 torpedoes (WWII-era, more reliable)
- Not Tigerfish (modern but less reliable)
- Pragmatic decision proved correct
- Three torpedoes fired, two hits
- Ship sank in 44 minutes

## Reactor

**Rolls-Royce PWR1:**
- First British naval reactor
- Pressurized Water Reactor design
- 15 MW thermal output
- Proven reliable
- Used in Resolution-class SSBNs also
- Technology independence achieved

## Modernizations

**1970s-1980s Updates:**
- Type 2020 sonar
- Tigerfish torpedo systems
- Later Spearfish torpedoes
- Communications upgrades
- Life extension programs

## Retirement

**Phased Decommissioning:**
- **Valiant** - Paid off 1994 (28 years)
- **Warspite** - Paid off 1991 (24 years)
- **Churchill** - Paid off 1992 (22 years)
- **Conqueror** - Paid off 1990 (19 years)
- **Courageous** - Paid off 1992 (21 years)

**Disposal:**
- All laid up awaiting disposal
- Reactor compartments stored
- Gradual dismantlement
- Environmental concerns

## Losses

**Zero Losses:**
- All 5 boats survived service
- No accidents or combat losses
- Successful operational careers
- Safe nuclear operations
- Perfect record

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Highly successful SSN class
- British reactor independence achieved
- Combat proven (Falklands)
- Long service lives
- Reliable operations

**Historical Significance:**
