# HMS Hood - Admiral-Class Battlecruiser (1920)

## Overview
HMS Hood was the pride of the Royal Navy between the wars, the largest and most powerful warship in the world for two decades. The sole completed ship of the Admiral-class battlecruisers, she combined battleship-level firepower (8× 15-inch guns) with high speed (31 knots) but had inadequate deck armor. On 24 May 1941, Hood was sunk by the German battleship Bismarck in the Battle of the Denmark Strait - a catastrophic magazine explosion killed 1,415 of her 1,418 crew. Only 3 survived.

## Service History

### Interwar Period (1920-1939)

**"The Mighty Hood":**
- Largest warship in world (1920-1940)
- Symbol of British naval power
- Flagship duties and world cruises
- Empire tour (1923-1924)

**Modernization:**
- 1929-1931: Significant refit
  - AA guns upgraded
  - Aircraft catapult added
  - Fire control modernized
- **Planned 1939 refit cancelled** due to war outbreak
  - Would have added deck armor (critical)
  - Never received necessary protection upgrades

### World War II (1939-1941)

**1939-1940:**
- Home Fleet operations
- Force H (Mediterranean)
- Mers-el-Kébir (July 1940): Attacked French Fleet
- Atlantic patrols hunting German raiders

**1941:**
- Home Fleet
- Denmark Strait patrol (May 1941)

## Battle of the Denmark Strait (24 May 1941)

### The Action

**Mission:** Intercept Bismarck and Prinz Eugen breaking into Atlantic

**British Forces:**
- HMS Hood (flagship, Vice Admiral Holland)
- HMS Prince of Wales (brand new, still working up)
- 6 destroyers

**German Forces:**
- Bismarck (battleship)
- Prinz Eugen (heavy cruiser)

**The Battle (0552-0600, 24 May 1941):**

**0552:** Hood and Prince of Wales open fire at 25,000 yards
**0555:** German ships return fire
**0600:** Hood hit by shells from Bismarck
- Shell penetrated thin deck armor
- Reached aft magazine
- **Catastrophic explosion**
- Ship broke in two
- Sank in **3 minutes**
- **1,415 killed, 3 survivors**

**Survivors:**
- Ordinary Signalman Ted Briggs
- Able Seaman Bob Tilburn
- Midshipman William Dundas
- Rescued by HMS Electra hours later

### Cause of Loss

**Official Inquiry Conclusion:**
- Shell from Bismarck penetrated thin deck armor (3 inches)
- Reached aft 15-inch or 4-inch magazine
- Magazine explosion broke ship in half

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Inadequate deck armor** (3 inches vs 6+ inches needed)
2. **Plunging fire** at long range (shells fell steeply)
3. **Magazine vulnerability** (British cordite highly flammable)
4. **Cancelled modernization** (1939 refit would have added deck armor)

**Comparison:**
- Hood: 3-inch deck armor
- Bismarck: 4.7-inch deck armor
- Modern battleships: 6-8 inch deck armor

### Aftermath

**British Response:**
- Churchill: "Sink the Bismarck!"
- Royal Navy mobilized entire Home Fleet
- Bismarck sunk 27 May 1941 (3 days later)

**National Trauma:**
- Hood was symbol of British sea power
- Loss shocked Britain
- 1,415 deaths greatest single RN loss of war

**Wreck:**
- Located 2001 by David Mearns
- Depth: 9,334 feet (2,846 m)
- Denmark Strait, 300 miles from Iceland
- Designated war grave

## Legacy

**Symbol of British Naval Power:**
- Most famous British warship of interwar period
- "The Mighty Hood" embodied Royal Navy prestige
- World tour (1923-1924) showcased British power

**Tragic Loss:**
- Demonstrated danger of inadequate armor
- Proved modern shells could penetrate older designs
- Lesson: Deck armor critical against plunging fire

**Remembrance:**
- HMS Hood Association maintains memory
- Wreck site protected as war grave
- Memorial at Portsmouth
- 3 survivors kept memory alive until their deaths (last died 2008)

**Technical Lessons:**
1. Deck armor essential (plunging fire)
2. Magazine protection critical
3. Modernization cannot be deferred
4. Speed without protection = vulnerability

## Comparison to Contemporaries

### Hood vs Other Battlecruisers

| Ship | Nation | Year | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Deck Armor |
|------|--------|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **HMS Hood** | UK | 1920 | 42,670 tons | 31 kn | 8× 15" | **3"** |
| Renown | UK | 1916/36 | 32,000 tons | 30 kn | 6× 15" | 5" (after refit) |
| Scharnhorst | Germany | 1939 | 32,100 tons | 32 kn | 9× 11" | 4.1" |
| Dunkerque | France | 1937 | 35,500 tons | 29.5 kn | 8× 13" | 5" |

### Hood vs Bismarck (The Fatal Matchup)

| Ship | Displacement | Speed | Main Guns | Belt Armor | **Deck Armor** |
|------|--------------|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **HMS Hood** | 46,680 tons | 31 kn | 8× 15" | 12" | **3"** ⚠️ |
| **Bismarck** | 50,300 tons | 30 kn | 8× 15" | 12.6" | **4.7"** |

**Critical Difference:** Bismarck's superior deck armor (4.7" vs 3") proved decisive.

## The Three Survivors

**Ordinary Signalman Ted Briggs (1923-2008):**
- Age 18 at sinking
- Last survivor (died 2008)
- Wrote memoir "Flagship Hood"
- Devoted life to preserving memory

**Able Seaman Bob Tilburn (1921-1995):**
- Age 20 at sinking
- Blown clear by explosion
- Continued RN service

**Midshipman William Dundas (1920-1965):**
- Age 20 at sinking
- Officer candidate
- Died 1965

All three thrown clear by the explosion, rescued from freezing Atlantic waters.

## Conclusions

HMS Hood was the most famous British warship of her era - a symbol of naval supremacy for 20 years. Her tragic loss in 3 minutes on 24 May 1941 shocked the world and demonstrated the deadly effectiveness of modern naval gunnery against inadequately protected ships.

**Key Points:**
1. **Largest warship** in world (1920-1940)
2. **Inadequate deck armor** (3 inches) - critical weakness
3. **Cancelled 1939 refit** would have added protection
4. **Catastrophic loss** - 1,415 of 1,418 crew killed
5. **Magazine explosion** from plunging fire
6. **National tragedy** - symbol of British power destroyed

Hood's loss led directly to the sinking of Bismarck three days later, as the Royal Navy sought vengeance. The wreck lies at 9,334 feet depth in the Denmark Strait, a war grave commemorating one of the greatest naval disasters in British history.

"The Mighty Hood" - remembered not for her 21 years of service, but for her 3 minutes of dying.
