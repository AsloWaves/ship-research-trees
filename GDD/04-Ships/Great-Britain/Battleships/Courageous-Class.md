# Courageous-Class Large Light Cruisers / Battlecruisers (1916-1917)

## Overview
The Courageous-class were three "large light cruisers" built 1915-1917, designed for Admiral Fisher's Baltic Project with shallow draft, high speed, and light armor. Classified as battlecruisers despite official designation, these unusual ships combined 15-inch guns with cruiser protection and were considered failed designs. HMS Courageous, HMS Glorious, and HMS Furious served briefly as battlecruisers before conversion to aircraft carriers (1920s-1930s). All three lost as carriers in WWII: Courageous torpedoed by U-29 (1939, 518 killed), Glorious sunk by Scharnhorst/Gneisenau (1940, 1,207 killed), Furious survived war and scrapped 1948.

## Fisher's Baltic Project

### Strategic Concept

**Admiral Fisher's Vision (1914-1915):**
- Amphibious assault on German Baltic coast
- Land British Army 100 miles from Berlin
- Force Germany to fight two-front war
- Support Russian operations in East Prussia
- Win WWI through strategic flanking maneuver

**Naval Requirements:**
- Shallow draft for Baltic operations (23-24 ft max)
- High speed to evade German battleships (32 knots)
- Heavy guns to bombard coastal fortifications (15-inch)
- Light armor acceptable (speed and range prioritized)
- Large numbers for sustained operations

**Reality:**
- Baltic Project never executed (too risky, strategically unsound)
- Ships designed for specific operation that never happened
- Left with warships unsuitable for actual naval warfare
- "Fisher's Folly" - battlecruisers too weak for fleet action

### Design Compromises

**Sacrifices for Shallow Draft:**
- Minimal armor (2-3 inch belt vs 9-inch on Lion-class)
- Light turret protection (7-13 inches vs 9 inches Lion)
- Thin deck armor (1-3 inches - vulnerable to plunging fire)
- Minimal underwater protection (vulnerable to torpedoes and mines)
- Poor seakeeping in heavy weather (low freeboard)

**Speed Advantages:**
- 90,000 shp (vs 70,000 Lion-class)
- 32 knots (vs 28 knots Lion-class)
- Fastest capital ships in Royal Navy
- Could outrun any German battleship
- But: Couldn't stand and fight

**Armament Oddities:**
- **Courageous/Glorious**: 4× 15-inch guns (light for size, but powerful)
- **Furious**: 2× 18-inch guns (largest naval guns ever mounted - experimental)
- Minimal secondary armament for anti-destroyer defense
- Vulnerable to destroyer/cruiser attack

## Service History as Battlecruisers

### World War I (1916-1918)

**Limited Operations:**
- Baltic Project cancelled (never executed)
- Too lightly armored for North Sea fleet actions
- Relegated to patrol and raiding duties
- Never engaged German battlecruisers (would have been slaughtered)
- Supporting role for Grand Fleet

**Second Battle of Heligoland Bight (17 November 1917):**
- **HMS Courageous and HMS Glorious**: Engaged German light forces
- **Action**: Light cruiser action, no major German units
- **Outcome**: British tactical success, German withdrawal
- **Assessment**: Ships performed adequately against light forces
- **Limitations**: Avoided any German heavy units

**HMS Furious Experimental Service:**
- **18-inch Guns**: Most powerful guns ever mounted on warship
- **Problems**: Severe blast damage to ship structure, limited firing arcs
- **Accuracy**: Poor due to ship's light structure and gun blast effects
- **Conclusion**: 18-inch guns impractical for this hull size
- **Conversion**: Forward turret removed 1917, flight deck installed

**Operational Assessment:**
- Too lightly protected for fleet action
- Vulnerable to cruisers and destroyers
- Speed advantage only value
- Minimal combat value as battlecruisers
- Designed for mission that never happened

### Post-War (1918-1920s)

**Recognition of Failure:**
- Ships acknowledged as failed design
- Too weak for capital ship role
- Too large and expensive for cruiser role
- Unsuitable for peacetime service
- Conversion to aircraft carriers proposed

**Washington Naval Treaty (1922):**
- Battlecruiser construction limits
- Allowed conversion of battlecruisers to aircraft carriers
- Courageous-class perfect candidates (too weak as battlecruisers, high speed good for carriers)
- Conversion begun 1920s

## Aircraft Carrier Conversions

### Conversion Details (1920s-1930s)

**HMS Furious (1917-1925):**
- **Progressive conversion**: Forward turret removed 1917, aft turret 1918, full conversion 1921-1925
- **Result**: Fleet carrier, 36 aircraft
- **Service**: WWII Atlantic and Arctic operations, Malta convoys
- **Fate**: Survived war, scrapped 1948

**HMS Courageous (1924-1928):**
- **Conversion**: 1924-1928
- **Result**: Fleet carrier, 48 aircraft
- **Service**: Home Fleet carrier until WWII
- **Fate**: Torpedoed by U-29, 17 September 1939 (first British warship lost WWII, 518 killed)

**HMS Glorious (1924-1930):**
- **Conversion**: 1924-1930
- **Result**: Fleet carrier, 48 aircraft
- **Service**: Norwegian campaign, Mediterranean
- **Fate**: Sunk by Scharnhorst/Gneisenau, 8 June 1940 (1,207 killed - worst carrier loss)

### Carrier Service Assessment

**As Carriers:**
- More successful than as battlecruisers
- High speed (30 knots) valuable for carrier operations
- Large hull allowed spacious hangars and flight decks
- Still lightly armored (vulnerable to surface attack)
- Glorious loss demonstrated carrier vulnerability without escort

## Major Losses (As Aircraft Carriers)

### HMS Courageous (17 September 1939)

**First British Warship Lost WWII:**
- **Location**: Western Approaches, southwest of Ireland
- **Cause**: Torpedoed by U-29 (Kapitänleutnant Otto Schuhart)
- **Details**: Anti-submarine patrol with inadequate destroyer escort
- **Damage**: 3 torpedoes, sank in 15 minutes
- **Casualties**: 518 killed (out of 1,260 crew)
- **Impact**: Demonstrated carrier vulnerability to submarines, changed RN carrier doctrine

### HMS Glorious (8 June 1940)

**Worst British Carrier Loss:**
- **Location**: Norwegian Sea, returning from Norway evacuation
- **Cause**: Intercepted by German battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau
- **Details**: Sailing without adequate air patrols or destroyer escort
- **Action**: Hit by 11-inch and 15-inch shells, sank after 90 minutes
- **Casualties**: 1,207 killed (out of 1,561 crew and evacuees)
- **Escorts**: Destroyers HMS Acasta and HMS Ardent also sunk
- **Controversy**: Why Glorious alone without adequate protection or air search?

**Lessons:**
- Carriers must never operate without escorts
- Air search and combat air patrol essential
- Light armor fatal against surface ships
- Original battlecruiser weakness (thin armor) killed her as carrier

## Design Assessment

### As Battlecruisers - Strengths
- 32-knot speed (fastest capital ships)
- 15-inch guns powerful (Courageous/Glorious)
- 18-inch guns most powerful ever (Furious - experimental)
- Shallow draft for Baltic operations
- Long range for extended operations

### As Battlecruisers - Weaknesses
- Minimal armor (2-3 inch belt - death trap)
- Vulnerable to any capital ship
- Vulnerable to cruisers and destroyers
- Poor seakeeping (low freeboard)
- Designed for mission that never happened
- "Fisher's Folly" - failed concept

### As Aircraft Carriers - Strengths
- High speed (30 knots as carriers)
- Large hull for aircraft capacity
- Successful conversion and operation
- Valuable carrier assets 1930s-1940s

### As Aircraft Carriers - Weaknesses
- Light armor inherited from battlecruiser design
- Vulnerable to surface attack (Glorious)
- Vulnerable to submarine attack (Courageous)
- Required strong escorts for survival

### Historical Significance
- **Fisher's Baltic Project**: Strategic pipe dream never executed
- **Design Failure**: Battlecruisers too weak for combat
- **Successful Conversion**: Better as carriers than battlecruisers
- **Tragic Losses**: 1,725 killed on Courageous and Glorious
- **18-inch Guns**: Furious tested largest naval guns ever (impractical)

## Comparison to Contemporaries

### vs Renown-Class (Britain, 1916)
- **Courageous**: 4× 15-inch vs Renown: 6× 15-inch
- **Courageous**: 2-3 inch armor vs Renown: 6 inch armor
- **Courageous**: 32 knots vs Renown: 32 knots (similar)
- **Verdict**: Renown better protected and more powerful

### vs Hood (Britain, 1920)
- **Hood**: 8× 15-inch guns vs Courageous: 4× 15-inch
- **Hood**: 12-inch belt armor vs Courageous: 2-3 inch belt
- **Hood**: 31 knots vs Courageous: 32 knots
- **Verdict**: Hood vastly superior in all respects

### vs Lexington-Class (USA, 1927 as carriers)
- **Lexington**: Converted battlecruisers (like Courageous)
- **Lexington**: Better protected (6-inch belt vs 2-3 inch)
- **Similar**: Both successful carrier conversions
- **Verdict**: Similar concept, Lexington better protected

## Legacy

**Design Lessons:**
- Specialized warships for hypothetical operations = failure
- Light armor on large ships fatal mistake
- Speed alone insufficient for survival
- Mission-specific design risky (mission may never happen)
- "Fisher's Folly" taught painful lessons

**Operational Legacy:**
- Successful as carriers despite design flaws
- High speed valuable for carrier operations
- Inadequate protection caused catastrophic losses
- Courageous first British warship lost WWII
- Glorious worst British carrier loss (1,207 killed)

**18-inch Gun Experiment (Furious):**
- Largest naval guns ever mounted
- Proved impractical for warship use
- Extreme blast effects damaged ship structure
- Accuracy poor due to ship's light construction
- Experiment never repeated (15-inch maximum for British ships)

**Carrier Doctrine:**
- Losses demonstrated carrier vulnerability
- Carriers must operate with strong escorts
- Air search and combat air patrol essential
- Light armor unacceptable for carriers
- Influenced British carrier design philosophy

**Historical Assessment:**
"The Courageous-class embodied the worst of Admiral Fisher's strategic fantasizing - battlecruisers designed for an amphibious operation that never happened, too lightly armored to fight, saved only by conversion to aircraft carriers. Their WWII losses as carriers (1,725 killed) were tragic vindication that no amount of speed could compensate for inadequate protection."
