# Bellerophon-Class Dreadnought Battleships (1907-1909)

## Overview
The Bellerophon-class were three dreadnought battleships built 1906-1909 as improved versions of HMS Dreadnought, featuring better armor distribution, improved machinery layout, and refined turret placement. As the second dreadnought class, they incorporated lessons learned from HMS Dreadnought while maintaining the revolutionary all-big-gun concept. HMS Bellerophon, HMS Superb, and HMS Temeraire served throughout WWI with the Grand Fleet, participating in Jutland (1916) and numerous North Sea operations. All three ships scrapped 1921-1922.

## Service History

### Pre-WWI Service (1909-1914)

**Home Fleet:**
- 1st Battleship Squadron
- North Sea exercises and war games
- Gunnery practice and tactical development
- Fleet reviews and diplomatic missions
- Validation of dreadnought concept

**Mediterranean Fleet (Brief):**
- Some ships rotated through Mediterranean
- Flag-showing missions
- Fleet exercises
- Training duties

### World War I (1914-1918)

**Grand Fleet Service:**
- Core of British battle line 1914-1918
- 4th Battle Squadron
- Scapa Flow and Rosyth bases
- North Sea patrols and sweeps
- Fleet exercises and readiness drills

**Battle of Jutland (31 May - 1 June 1916):**
- All three ships participated
- 4th Battle Squadron, Vice-Admiral Sturdee
- Engaged German High Seas Fleet
- No significant damage to any Bellerophon-class ship
- Contributed to forcing German withdrawal

**Jutland Performance:**
- **HMS Bellerophon**: Fired 62× 12-inch shells, no hits confirmed
- **HMS Superb**: Limited engagement, poor visibility
- **HMS Temeraire**: Engaged German battlecruisers and battleships
- **Assessment**: Solid performance, demonstrated dreadnought value
- **Damage**: Minimal; ships remained operational throughout

**North Sea Operations (1914-1918):**

- **Later**: Pursuit and intermittent engagement

**Results:**
- No major damage to Bellerophon-class ships
- Ammunition expenditure modest (visibility problems)
- Solid performance in line
- Contributed to German withdrawal
- Vindicated dreadnought design

## Comparison to Contemporaries

## Legacy

**Design Evolution:**
- Led directly to St Vincent-class (improved Bellerophon)
- Validated all-big-gun dreadnought concept
- Incorporated lessons learned from HMS Dreadnought
- Established British dreadnought building program

**Operational Impact:**
- Core of Grand Fleet 1914-1918
- Jutland participants (all three ships)
- Maintained British naval supremacy
- Deterred German High Seas Fleet

**Tactical Lessons:**
- Dreadnought concept proven in combat (Jutland)
- Need for higher speed validated (later classes faster)
- Armor adequate but improvements needed
- Fire control critical (visibility problems at Jutland)

**Historical Significance:**
- Second dreadnought class confirmed revolution
- WWI service validated design
- Jutland demonstrated effectiveness
- Successful follow-on to revolutionary HMS Dreadnought

**Quote:**
"The Bellerophon-class represented the second step in the dreadnought revolution - incorporating improvements from HMS Dreadnought while validating the all-big-gun concept through solid WWI service culminating in the Battle of Jutland, where they proved the worth of British dreadnought design."
