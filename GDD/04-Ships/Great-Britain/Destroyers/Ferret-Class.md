# Ferret-Class Torpedo Boat Destroyers (1893)

## Overview
HMS Ferret and HMS Lynx were third and fourth in the pioneering group of torpedo boat destroyers ordered in 1893, built by Laird Brothers. They featured a third distinct design approach, proving that multiple builders could successfully produce effective destroyers and establishing competitive tendering as the standard procurement method.
