# Beagle-Class Destroyers (G-Class) (1909)

## Overview
The Beagle-class (G-Class) were improved versions of the Acorn-class, with 16 ships built 1909-1910. They featured enhanced oil fuel capacity and improved seaworthiness while maintaining the successful design formula of their predecessors. They served extensively in WWI, with several losses to mines and torpedoes.
