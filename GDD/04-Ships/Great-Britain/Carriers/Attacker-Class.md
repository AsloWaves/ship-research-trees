# Attacker-Class Escort Carriers (1942-1943)

## Overview
The Attacker-class were escort carriers with 8 ships built in US shipyards 1942-1943 under the Lend-Lease program and transferred to the Royal Navy. Based on the US Bogue-class design, they were converted from C3 merchant hulls. They provided crucial convoy escort, anti-submarine warfare, and amphibious support during WWII, serving in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific theaters.

- ASW patrols Norwegian Sea

### Anti-Submarine Warfare
- **Aircraft:** Swordfish, Avenger, Wildcat, Seafire
- **Tactics:** Hunter-killer groups, convoy protection
- **Success:** Multiple U-boat kills and assists
- **Technology:** ASV radar, depth charges, acoustic homing torpedoes

## Aircraft Operations

**Fighter Component:**
- Grumman Wildcat (FM-1/2): Primary fighter 1942-1943
- Grumman Hellcat (F6F): Later deployments 1944-1945
- Supermarine Seafire: Some operations (challenging on short deck)

**ASW Component:**
- Fairey Swordfish: Primary ASW 1942-1944 (long range, reliability)

## Comparison to Other Escort Carriers

### vs Ruler-Class (Lend-Lease)
- Similar design (both Bogue-class basis)
- Ruler-class: More ships (31 vs 8)
- Attacker: Earlier deliveries (1942-1943)
- Similar capabilities and limitations

### vs Activity-Class (British-built)
- Activity: Only 1 ship, British design
- Attacker: 8 ships, US design, faster delivery
- Both: Similar missions and capabilities

### vs Merchant Aircraft Carriers (MAC)
- MAC: Merchant ships with flight deck, smaller air group
- Attacker: Purpose-built escort carriers, better capability
- MAC: Retained cargo capacity, Attacker: Full carrier

## Return to US Navy (1945-1946)

**Post-War:**
- All 8 ships returned to USN 1945-1946
- Lend-Lease terms required return
- Royal Navy transitioning to larger carriers
- Escort carriers obsolete for peacetime

**Disposal:**
- All scrapped 1946-1948
- Worn out from intensive wartime use
- US had surplus escort carriers
- Not worth refitting/modernizing

## Losses

**Zero Combat Losses:**
- All 8 ships survived the war
- Returned safely to US custody
- Good safety record
- Minimal battle damage

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Successful Lend-Lease program
- Filled critical capability gap 1942-1944
- Proved escort carrier concept
- Cost-effective ASW and convoy protection
- Simple, reliable design

**Historical Significance:**
- Closed mid-Atlantic air gap
- Enabled North African and Italian landings
- Arctic convoy protection vital
- Transferred carrier expertise to RN
- Foundation for British escort carrier ops

**Operational Impact:**
- Atlantic: U-boat defense, convoy protection
- Mediterranean: Amphibious support, fighter cover
- Arctic: Tirpitz strikes, Russian convoy escort
- Pacific: Limited operations (mostly Atlantic/Med)
- ASW: Multiple U-boat kills

**Design Influence:**
- Demonstrated escort carrier viability
- Proved converted merchant hull concept
- Influenced British escort carrier design
- Showed limitations of small carriers
- Validated Lend-Lease cooperation

**Notable Quote:**
"The Attacker-class may have been simple merchant conversions, but they closed the mid-Atlantic air gap and protected countless convoys from U-boats. They were exactly what the Royal Navy needed in 1942-1944."
