# HMS Bristol (Type 82 Destroyer) (1973)

## Overview
HMS Bristol was a Type 82 destroyer designed as an escort for the cancelled CVA-01 aircraft carriers. At 7,100 tons full load, she was effectively cruiser-sized and represented the largest destroyer built for the Royal Navy. Only one ship was completed, serving until 1991 as a trials and training ship.

## Design

**CVA-01 Escort:**
- Designed for carrier escort
- Large size for endurance
- Heavy missile armament
- Advanced systems

**Key Features:**
- Sea Dart area defense missiles
- Ikara long-range ASW system
- COSAG propulsion (steam + gas turbine)
- Advanced electronics suite
- Helicopter facility

**Design Philosophy:**
- Fleet air defense
- ASW capability
- Carrier escort role
- Cruiser-sized destroyer

## Service History

**HMS Bristol (D23):**
- Laid down 1967
- Launched 1969
- Commissioned 1973
- Only ship of class completed
- Trials and training ship 1973-1991
- Decommissioned 1991
- Preserved at Portsmouth

**Operational Service:**
- Limited operational deployments
- Primarily trials ship
- Weapons testing platform
- Training duties
- Never saw combat

**Post-Cancellation Role:**
- CVA-01 cancelled 1966
- Bristol completed anyway
- Used for trials and development
- Tested new systems
- Training ship

## Cancellations

**Planned Class:**
- Four ships originally planned
- Only Bristol completed
- Others cancelled with CVA-01
- Made redundant by carrier cancellation

**Cancelled Ships:**
- HMS Sheffield (later name used for Type 42)
- HMS Coventry (later name used for Type 42)
- HMS Glasgow (later name used for Type 42)

## Technology

**COSAG Propulsion:**
- Steam turbines for cruise
- Gas turbines for boost
- Complex but effective
- Good range and speed

**Weapons Systems:**
- Sea Dart long-range SAM
- Ikara ASW missile system
- 4.5-inch Mk 8 gun
- Limbo ASW mortar

**Electronics:**
- Type 1022 long-range radar
- Type 992Q search radar
- Type 909 missile fire control
- Advanced for era

## Preservation

**Museum Ship:**
- Preserved at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard
- Static display (not open to public as of 2024)
- Last of the large RN destroyers
- Unique survivor

## Legacy

**Design Assessment:**
- Excellent ship made redundant
- Too large and expensive as destroyer
- Advanced systems successful
- Victim of carrier cancellation

**Historical Significance:**
- Last "cruiser-sized" RN surface combatant
- Transitional design
- Pioneered systems for Type 42
- One-ship class

**Technological Impact:**
- Tested Sea Dart system
- Proved COSAG propulsion
- Advanced electronics platform
- Influenced later designs

**End of Large Destroyers:**
- Last large RN destroyer
- Type 42 much smaller and cheaper
- Economics favored smaller ships
- End of destroyer-cruiser size ships
