**WWII Tank Landing Ships** - 113 LST(2)-Class ships transferred to Royal Navy under Lend-Lease 1942-1945. Direct beach assault capability. 24,000 nm range. Carried 18-20 tanks.

**Key Specs:** 1,625/4,080 tons | 328ft | 12 kn | 18-20 tanks | 140-265 troops | Direct beach landing

**Innovation:** Revolutionary bow door/ramp design allowed direct beach assault without landing craft. Could carry 18-20 M4 Sherman tanks or 30-40 trucks. Ballast system pumped out for beaching operations after ocean crossings.

**Ships:** 113 British vessels used original US hull numbers (LST-3 through LST-1152) with HMS prefix. Notable examples: HMS LST 401 (commissioned 30 Nov 1942, Mediterranean convoys), LST 402, 408, 409, 416, 419, 423, 428, 430.

**Service:** Participated in all major Allied amphibious operations including Sicily (Operation Husky, July 1943), Salerno, and D-Day landings at Normandy (June 1944). British LSTs proved outstanding in performance despite challenging conditions including beach congestion, mines, and enemy air attacks. Most decommissioned and returned to US control 1945-1946 after war's end.

**Nickname:** Affectionately called "Large Slow Target" by crews due to 12-knot maximum speed. Only 26 LST(2) lost to enemy action out of 1,051 built (2.5% loss rate) - testament to robust design.

**Design:** Joint British-American development. Britain sent rough sketch to USA 5 Nov 1941, accepted immediately. UK originally requested 200 under Lend-Lease, ultimately received 113. Ships had hull numbers only, no names.
