**WWII Tank Landing Craft** - LCT Mark 4 was most produced British landing craft variant with 865 built 1941-1945. Carried 3 medium tanks. 8 knots. Direct beach assault.

**Key Specs:** 286/586 tons | 187ft | 8 kn | 3 medium tanks | 136 tons freight | 13 crew

**Innovation:** The LCT Mark 4 represented the most successful British landing craft design of WWII, with 865 units produced - the largest production run of any British LCT variant. Could carry 3 M4 Sherman medium tanks or 136 tonnes of freight directly to invasion beaches. Simple, reliable design with 8-knot maximum speed.

**Service:** Workhorses of British amphibious operations throughout WWII. Participated in all major invasions including North Africa, Sicily (Operation Husky, July 1943), Salerno, and most notably D-Day landings at Normandy (June 1944). Direct beach landing capability via bow ramp allowed rapid tank deployment. Operated by Royal Navy and RFA.

**Design Evolution:** The LCT series progressed from Mark 1 (372 tons, 1940) through eight marks. Mark 4 struck optimal balance between size, capacity, and producibility. US-built Marks 5 and 6 supplemented British production via Lend-Lease. Final Mark 8 (1,017 tons, 1944) served into 1960s.

**Armament:** Lightly armed with 2× 20mm Oerlikon cannons for anti-aircraft defense. Crew of 13 (1 officer, 12 enlisted). Range of 700 nautical miles at 7 knots allowed cross-channel operations from British ports.
