**WWII Troop Landing Craft** - LCI(L) were US-built troop carriers, 211 transferred to Royal Navy under Lend-Lease 1943-1945. Carried 200 troops. 16 knots. Direct beach landing.

**Key Specs:** 236/419 tons | 158ft | 16 kn | 188-200 troops | Twin bow ramps | 24 crew

**Innovation:** The LCI(L) was a purpose-designed troop carrier that could transport troops directly to invasion beaches and land them via two ramps lowered on either side of the bow. 16-knot maximum speed (14 knots continuous) allowed rapid assault waves. Shallow 4-foot draft enabled close beach approach. Could carry 6 officers and 182 enlisted (approximately 200 troops total).

**Service:** US-designed and built with 923 constructed starting in 1943. Britain received 211 vessels under Lend-Lease program. Essential for large-scale amphibious operations in both European and Pacific theaters. Participated in D-Day landings, Mediterranean operations, and Pacific island assaults. Transported assault waves directly to beaches while larger troopships remained offshore.

**Armament:** Defensively armed with 4-5× Oerlikon 20mm Mk 4 automatic cannons (1 forward, 1 amidships, 2 aft). Some variants received heavier armament including 40mm cannons, rocket launchers, or mortars for fire support missions. Crew of 24 (3 officers, 21 enlisted).

**Design:** Twin bow ramps allowed simultaneous troop deployment on both sides of vessel. Compact design maximized troop capacity while maintaining shallow draft. Most decommissioned and returned to US control 1945-1946 following end of hostilities.
