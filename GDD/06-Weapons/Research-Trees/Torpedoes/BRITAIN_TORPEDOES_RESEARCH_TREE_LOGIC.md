## Overview

British torpedo development represents the **origin of modern naval torpedoes**. Robert Whitehead invented the self-propelled torpedo in 1866 at Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia), and the Royal Navy was the first major adopter. Key developments include:
- **Pioneer Era**: Whitehead original designs, Royal Navy early adoption
- **WWI**: Dominance with 18" and 21" torpedoes, submarine ASW pioneer
- **Interwar**: Continued innovation, oxygen experiments (abandoned)
- **WWII**: Mark VIII reliability (vs. Mark 14 failures), Swordfish aerial torpedoes
- **Post-WWII**: Mark 20/23, Tigerfish wire-guided, Spearfish heavyweight

**Historical Significance**:
- Robert Whitehead invented the torpedo (1866) - British engineer
- First successful torpedo attack: HMS Shah vs Huáscar (1877)
- Swordfish torpedo attack sank Bismarck (1941)
- Mark VIII: Most reliable WWII submarine torpedo (vs. Mark 14 problems)
- Spearfish: Modern heavyweight (1988-present, dual propulsion)

## Legendary & Iconic Torpedoes

### Whitehead Original (1866) - "The Invention"
**Historical Impact**: Robert Whitehead, British engineer working at Fiume, invented the self-propelled torpedo in 1866. Used compressed air and clockwork depth control. Revolutionized naval warfare—suddenly small torpedo boats could threaten battleships.

**Game Representation**: FREE starting torpedo for Britain. Low performance but represents the birth of torpedo warfare. All other nations' torpedoes trace lineage to this design.

### Mark VIII & Mark VIII** - "The Reliable One"
**Historical Impact**: In stark contrast to the problematic US Mark 14, the British 21" Mark VIII was **the most reliable submarine torpedo of WWII**. Entered service 1927, continuously upgraded. Mark VIII** (double asterisk) variant (1942) had burner-cycle engine for 45 kts. Used by Royal Navy submarines throughout WWII with excellent reliability.

**Game Representation**: Tier 8 submarine primary weapon. Higher reliability stat than contemporary torpedoes. Mark VIII** represents wartime upgrade with improved speed.

### 18" Mark XII - "The Bismarck Killer"
**Historical Impact**: Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers armed with 18" Mark XII torpedoes attacked Bismarck on May 26, 1941. One torpedo jammed Bismarck's rudder, allowing Royal Navy to catch and sink her. Despite obsolete aircraft, effective torpedoes and skilled crews proved decisive.

**Game Representation**: Tier 8 aerial torpedo. Critical hit chance bonus against battleship rudders (historical accuracy). Synergizes with Swordfish aircraft.

### Spearfish - "Dual Propulsion Pioneer"
**Historical Impact**: Revolutionary **dual propulsion system**—Otto fuel motor for transit, high-test peroxide rocket for sprint attack (65+ kts). Wire-guided with active/passive sonar. Entered service 1988, still in use by Royal Navy. Represents pinnacle of conventional (non-nuclear) heavyweight torpedoes.

**Game Representation**: Tier 10 ultimate weapon. Sprint-attack capability (slow cruise, high-speed terminal). Expensive but devastating. Represents 1990 cutting-edge technology.

## Research Cost & Time Balance

**Tier-Based Scaling**:
- **Tier 1-2** (1866-1900): Low cost ($0-$150K), short time (0-45 days) - invention era
- **Tier 3-5** (1900-1920): Medium cost ($120K-$700K), medium time (60-180 days) - WWI standardization
- **Tier 6-8** (1920-1945): High cost ($400K-$2.5M), long time (120-210 days) - interwar/WWII
- **Tier 9** (1945-1975): Very high cost ($1.8M-$5.5M), extended time (210-480 days) - Cold War
- **Tier 10** (1975-1990): Extreme cost ($3.5M-$11M), maximum time (330-600 days) - modern systems

**Special Considerations**:
- Mark VIII**: Faster research (150 days) for wartime emergency upgrade
- Mark IX**: Faster research (150 days) for wartime mod
- Oxygen experiment (1127): Very high cost ($1.5M), long time (360 days) - failed R&D program
- Training torpedoes: Low cost, short time for gameplay utility
- Spearfish: Highest cost ($10M), longest time (600 days) - cutting-edge dual propulsion
