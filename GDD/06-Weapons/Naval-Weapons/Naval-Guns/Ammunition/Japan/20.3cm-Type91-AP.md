## Notes

The 20.3cm Type 91 AP shell armed Japan's powerful heavy cruiser force. Japanese heavy cruisers were among the most formidable in the world, featuring excellent fire control and optical rangefinding equipment. This ammunition incorporated advanced cap design for improved armor penetration and featured the Type 91's characteristic underwater trajectory capability, though less pronounced than in larger calibers. These shells saw extensive combat during the numerous nighttime surface engagements in the Solomon Islands campaign, where Japanese heavy cruisers excelled in close-range combat.
