## Notes

The 8cm Type 88 AA HE was one of the IJN's earliest purpose-designed anti-aircraft rounds, entering service in 1928 as aircraft began to pose a credible threat to naval forces. The Type 88 mechanical time fuze allowed the shell to be set to detonate at a specific altitude, creating a fragmentation cloud that could damage or destroy aircraft. The fuze was manually set before loading, with fire control systems calculating the required time-to-target based on aircraft altitude and speed.

By 1941, the Type 88 system was already showing its age compared to more modern dual-purpose weapons like the 12.7cm Type 89. The mechanical time fuze was slow to set and prone to errors, particularly under combat stress. However, the weapon remained in widespread service throughout the war, particularly on older cruisers, destroyers, and auxiliary vessels that lacked the electrical systems required for more modern fire control. The 8cm caliber occupied an awkward middle ground—too large for rapid-fire close defense, too small for effective long-range barrage fire against high-altitude bombers.
