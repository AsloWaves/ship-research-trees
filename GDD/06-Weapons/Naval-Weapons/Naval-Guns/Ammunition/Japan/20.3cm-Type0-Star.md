## Notes

The 20.3cm Type 0 Star Shell was the most powerful illumination round in the IJN's inventory prior to the introduction of battleship-caliber star shells. Heavy cruisers carrying these rounds could illuminate targets at extreme ranges, providing critical tactical advantage during night surface actions. The large illuminant canister produced intense, long-duration illumination that could expose entire enemy formations to visual observation and gunfire.

The Type 0 Star Shell played a significant role in several major night engagements. At the Battle of Savo Island (August 1942), Japanese heavy cruisers used star shells to devastating effect, illuminating the Allied screening force before launching a coordinated torpedo and gunfire attack. The star shells allowed Japanese gunners to acquire targets quickly while their own ships remained in relative darkness. Similar tactics were employed at subsequent night actions throughout the Solomons campaign. However, the advent of radar-directed gunfire in American ships gradually negated the advantage provided by star shell illumination, as radar could detect and track targets regardless of light conditions. By late 1944, star shells were used more defensively, illuminating suspected submarine periscope sightings and screening approaches to anchorages.
