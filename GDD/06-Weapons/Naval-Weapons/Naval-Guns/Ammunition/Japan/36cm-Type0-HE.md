## Notes

The Type 0 high-explosive shell provided Japanese 36cm gun-armed vessels with capability against shore targets and unarmored vessels. These shells saw extensive use during bombardment operations throughout the Pacific theater, particularly during the campaigns in the Solomon Islands where fast battleships like the Kongo-class conducted nighttime bombardments of American positions on Guadalcanal and other islands.
