## Notes

The 15.5cm Type 0 HE was the primary high-explosive round for Japan's most modern light cruisers, including the Mogami-class before their conversion to 20.3cm guns, the Agano-class, and the Oyodo. The same ammunition also served in the Yamato-class battleships' secondary battery, where it provided medium-range defense against cruisers and destroyers. The round featured a substantial bursting charge that made it highly effective against unarmored and lightly-armored targets.

In combat, the Type 0 HE proved devastating in surface engagements. At the Battle of Midway, Mogami and Mikuma exchanged fire using 15.5cm HE, demonstrating the round's ability to inflict severe damage through blast effect and fragmentation even against armored warships. During the Battle off Samar in 1944, Yamato's 15.5cm secondary battery engaged American destroyers and destroyer escorts, with Type 0 HE scoring numerous hits that caused significant topside damage. The round was equally effective against merchant vessels and transports, where a single hit could cause catastrophic fires or flooding.
