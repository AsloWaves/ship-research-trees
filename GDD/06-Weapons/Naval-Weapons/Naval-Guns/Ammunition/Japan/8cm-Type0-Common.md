## Notes

The 8cm Type 0 Common shell was developed as a more versatile alternative to the dedicated AA round, incorporating features suitable for both anti-aircraft and surface engagement. The heavier construction with thicker walls provided better penetration against lightly-armored targets such as destroyers, motor torpedo boats, and merchant vessels, while retaining the ability to function as an AA round when fitted with time fuzes.

In practice, the Type 0 Common was most frequently employed in the surface role, as dedicated AA ships typically carried the lighter Type 88 AA rounds for optimal ceiling performance. The Common shell found its niche on escorts and patrol vessels that needed to engage a variety of threats with limited magazine space. During the desperate surface actions of 1944-45, when IJN vessels increasingly engaged PT boats and landing craft at close range, the Type 0 proved valuable for its combination of bursting charge and penetrative capability.
