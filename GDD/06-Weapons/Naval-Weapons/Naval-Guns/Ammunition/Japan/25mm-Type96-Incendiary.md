## Notes

The Type 96 Incendiary round was developed specifically to counter the threat of early-war patrol bombers and torpedo bombers, which featured fabric-covered control surfaces and un-protected fuel tanks. The phosphorus/magnesium composition ignited on impact, creating intense heat that could set fire to aircraft structures, fuel systems, and hydraulic lines. The round was most effective against unarmored or lightly-armored aircraft.

As the war progressed and American aircraft became increasingly robust with self-sealing fuel tanks and fire suppression systems, the incendiary round's effectiveness diminished. However, it remained useful against wooden structures on PT boats and landing craft. The round was typically loaded in small quantities mixed with HE and AP ammunition. Some IJN gunners reported that incendiary hits, while rarely immediately catastrophic, could force damaged aircraft to break off their attack runs, providing a defensive benefit even without confirmed kills.
