## Notes

The Type 98 AA shell was the specialized anti-aircraft variant of the 10cm ammunition family, featuring a mechanical time fuze for barrage fire against aircraft formations. The fuze could be set before loading to detonate at specific ranges or altitudes, creating fragmentation patterns to damage or destroy aircraft. The shell also featured a self-destruct mechanism to prevent unexploded projectiles from falling on friendly forces.

This ammunition was used alongside the Type 0 HE round, with Type 98 being preferred for engaging aircraft at longer ranges where the time fuze could create effective barrage patterns. The combination of high muzzle velocity, good explosive content, and reliable fuzing made this one of Japan's most effective anti-aircraft munitions. However, like many late-war Japanese weapons, it arrived too late and in insufficient quantities to stem the tide of American air superiority. The Akizuki-class destroyers that primarily used this ammunition were highly regarded by their crews and feared by Allied pilots, but only twelve were completed before war's end.
