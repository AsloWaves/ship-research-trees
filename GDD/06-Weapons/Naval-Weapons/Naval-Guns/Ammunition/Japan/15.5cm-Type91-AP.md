## Notes

The 15.5cm Type 91 AP shell was most notably used by the Mogami-class cruisers in their original light cruiser configuration, which mounted fifteen 15.5cm guns in five triple turrets. This gave them the heaviest broadside of any light cruiser in the world. The Mogami-class were later rebuilt as heavy cruisers with 20.3cm guns, but retained their exceptional fire control systems. The Oyodo, Japan's last purpose-built cruiser, also used these weapons. The high muzzle velocity gave these shells excellent flat trajectory and penetration characteristics.
