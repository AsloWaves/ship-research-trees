## Notes

The 14cm Type 0 HE shell armed Japan's earlier generation light cruisers, which served primarily as destroyer flotilla leaders and screening vessels for the main battle fleet. These older cruisers saw extensive service during the Solomon Islands campaign, where their rapid-fire 14cm batteries proved effective in the confused nighttime surface engagements that characterized naval combat in that theater. Ships like Sendai, Jintsu, and others of this class fought in numerous battles before being lost in action.
