## Notes

The 12.7cm Type 2 Star Shell was developed to provide night illumination for surface actions, a critical capability given the IJN's emphasis on night combat tactics. The star shell concept dated back to World War I, but the Type 2 incorporated improvements in illuminant composition and parachute design that provided more consistent performance. Upon reaching the set altitude, the time fuze expelled the illuminant canister and deployed a parachute, allowing the magnesium flare to descend slowly while illuminating the target area.

The Type 2 proved highly effective in the numerous night surface actions of 1942-43, when Japanese destroyer crews had superior training and tactics. At battles such as Savo Island and Tassafaronga, Japanese destroyers used star shells to illuminate American ships while remaining in relative darkness themselves, facilitating devastating torpedo attacks. However, the star shell's effectiveness declined as American forces adopted radar fire control, which eliminated the Japanese advantage in night visual combat. By 1944, star shells were used primarily for defensive purposes, illuminating areas where submarine periscopes or PT boats were suspected. The distinctive green band marking allowed crews to quickly identify star shells in low-light conditions during ammunition handling.
