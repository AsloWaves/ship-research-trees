## Notes

The Type 91 HE-T incorporated a tracer element to aid fire correction, following standard practice for medium-caliber anti-aircraft ammunition. The tracer composition was formulated to produce a distinct red signature that could be easily distinguished from other calibers in use, allowing fire control officers to coordinate multi-caliber defensive barrages more effectively.

Production of 40mm ammunition was complicated by Japan's shortage of specialized manufacturing equipment and raw materials. Each 40mm mount required substantially more copper and brass than the 25mm system, making widespread adoption impossible given wartime material constraints. Ships fortunate enough to receive 40mm mounts often operated with limited ammunition stocks, sometimes less than 1,000 rounds per barrel compared to the 15,000+ rounds typically carried for 25mm guns. This scarcity meant that 40mm guns were reserved for critical defensive moments rather than being used for sustained barrage fire.
