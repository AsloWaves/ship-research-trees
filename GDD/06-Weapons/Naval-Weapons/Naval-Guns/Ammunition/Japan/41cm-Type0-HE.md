## Notes

The 41cm Type 0 HE Common shell was developed as a multi-purpose projectile for the Nagato-class battleships, combining substantial high-explosive content with enough structural integrity to penetrate light armor before detonating. The "common" designation indicated its dual capability—effective against both armored and unarmored targets. With 33.5kg of high explosive, it was one of the most powerful HE shells in any navy's inventory prior to the Yamato's 46cm ammunition.

In combat, the Type 0 HE proved devastatingly effective against unarmored and lightly-armored targets. During shore bombardment missions in the Philippines and other Pacific islands, Nagato's 41cm HE shells created massive craters and could demolish reinforced concrete structures with single hits. The round saw limited ship-to-ship combat use, as most surface engagements involving Nagato-class ships called for armor-piercing ammunition. However, the Type 0's combination of blast effect and moderate penetration capability made it valuable for engaging destroyers and light cruisers at long range, where overpenetration by AP shells might result in reduced damage.
