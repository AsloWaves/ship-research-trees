## Notes

The 20.3cm Type 3 Sanshikidan was among the most powerful anti-aircraft projectiles deployed by any navy during World War II. With 1,800 incendiary sub-projectiles, it created a devastating pattern that theoretically could engage even high-altitude heavy bombers. The round was developed for IJN heavy cruisers as a means of providing long-range anti-aircraft capability using their main batteries, which otherwise had limited utility against aircraft.

Combat employment of the 20.3cm Sanshikidan revealed the fundamental limitations of the concept. At the Battle of the Philippine Sea and subsequent engagements, Japanese heavy cruisers fired these rounds at attacking American aircraft with minimal success. The time required to train the heavy turrets on fast-moving aircraft, combined with the slow rate of fire (3-4 rpm) and difficulty of fuze setting, meant that relatively few rounds could be fired during a typical attack run. Post-war analysis of American aircraft damage rarely attributed hits to large-caliber Sanshikidan, though several pilots reported near-misses that caused temporary disorientation. The round's primary value may have been in forcing attacking formations to disperse, potentially degrading their bombing accuracy.
