## Notes

The Type 91 armor-piercing shell was the largest and heaviest naval projectile ever used in combat. It was specifically designed for the Yamato-class battleships and featured exceptional underwater trajectory capability due to its unique nose cap design. The shell could maintain stability after penetrating water, allowing it to strike below the armor belt of enemy vessels. This capability was a closely guarded secret of the Imperial Japanese Navy and represented cutting-edge ballistic technology of the era.
