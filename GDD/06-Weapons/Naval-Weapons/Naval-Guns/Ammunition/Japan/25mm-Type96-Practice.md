## Notes

The Type 96 Practice round was essential for training the thousands of anti-aircraft gunners required by the expanding IJN fleet in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The reduced propellant charge lowered the round's velocity and range, making it safer for training exercises near ports and anchorages. The inert projectile eliminated the risk of accidental detonations while providing realistic ballistics for gunnery training.

As the war intensified and Japan's strategic situation deteriorated, practice ammunition became increasingly scarce. Many training programs were forced to reduce live-fire exercises, relying instead on dry-fire drills and basic loading practice. By 1944, some newly-assigned AA crews received minimal live-fire training before being sent into combat. The shortage of practice ammunition, combined with the general inexperience of late-war IJN crews, contributed significantly to the declining effectiveness of Japanese anti-aircraft defenses.
