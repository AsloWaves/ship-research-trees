## Notes

The 12.7cm Type 3 San-shiki shell was a scaled-down version of the larger caliber incendiary shrapnel rounds, designed to provide Japanese destroyers with specialized anti-aircraft capability. Like its larger counterparts, it dispersed incendiary tubes in a cone pattern ahead of the projectile. However, the small size and difficulty of hitting fast-moving aircraft with destroyer guns made this ammunition largely ineffective in practice. The shell saw limited use as Japanese destroyers increasingly relied on dedicated anti-aircraft guns rather than main battery fire for air defense. By 1943-44, it became clear that purpose-built AA weapons like the 10cm/65 Type 98 were far more effective, leading to reduced production of San-shiki ammunition.
