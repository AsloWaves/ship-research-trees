## Notes

The 38cm Spgr. Bdz. was a specialized base-fuzed high-explosive shell for the Bismarck-class battleships, designed to penetrate armor and deck plating before detonating deep within enemy warships. The base fuze location allowed the massive 800-kilogram shell to punch through significant armor thickness, with the 0.04-second delay ensuring detonation occurred after penetration into vital spaces. The enormous 58.5-kilogram bursting charge created devastating internal explosions when detonating within enemy vessels. This ammunition was particularly effective against cruisers and destroyers, where the combination of penetration and massive explosive content could cause catastrophic damage with single hits. During the Denmark Strait action (May 1941), Bismarck's base-fuzed HE shells proved devastating against British destroyers attempting to close for torpedo attacks. The shell could penetrate multiple decks and bulkheads before detonating in machinery spaces, magazines, or below the waterline, causing massive flooding and structural damage. The base fuze had to withstand tremendous setback forces (over 50,000 G's) during firing while maintaining reliability. Bismarck and Tirpitz typically loaded mixed ammunition including AP, nose-fuzed HE, and base-fuzed HE, with base-fuzed rounds reserved for engagement with lighter armored vessels where maximum internal damage was desired rather than armor penetration capability.
