## Notes

The 8.8cm Spgr. L/4.5 was the standard high-explosive round for the famous 8.8cm Flak guns when employed in naval mountings. These weapons were installed on various Kriegsmarine vessels including auxiliary cruisers, armed merchant raiders, U-boat tenders, and escort vessels. The powerful bursting charge provided excellent fragmentation against aircraft and was equally effective against surface targets including merchant vessels and small warships. The round featured a mechanical time fuze that could be set for airburst against aircraft formations or impact detonation for surface targets. In the dual-purpose role, this ammunition proved highly versatile, with the high muzzle velocity ensuring flat trajectory and short time-of-flight. The 8.8cm guns aboard armed merchant raiders like Atlantis and Kormoran used this ammunition to devastating effect against Allied merchantmen in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans during 1940-1941.
