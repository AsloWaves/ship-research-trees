## Notes

The 12.7cm Pzgr. was the armor-piercing shell for German destroyer main guns, designed primarily for use against enemy destroyers and light vessels. While destroyers typically favored HE shells, AP rounds were carried for engagements with armored opponents. The shell featured an armor-piercing cap and was capable of penetrating light cruiser armor at moderate ranges. Used during destroyer actions in the English Channel, North Sea, and Arctic, where German destroyers often encountered British and Soviet naval forces.
