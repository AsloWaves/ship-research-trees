## Notes

The 12.7cm Leuchtgr. provided long-range battlefield illumination for German capital ships and heavy cruisers equipped with 12.7cm secondary batteries. The large illuminant charge produced brilliant white light visible for many kilometers, allowing acquisition and engagement of surface targets during night actions. The time-fuzed shell was set to eject its parachute-suspended flare at the desired altitude, typically 1,000-2,000 meters, where it would drift slowly downward while burning. This ammunition was particularly important for German capital ships operating in northern waters where extended periods of darkness or poor visibility were common. During the Battle of the Barents Sea (December 1942), Admiral Hipper used 12.7cm star shells to illuminate British convoy escorts before engaging with main battery fire. The 50-second burn time was among the longest of any naval star shell, providing sustained illumination for fire control and target tracking. Ships typically allocated 5-10% of their 12.7cm ammunition capacity to star shells for night fighting capability.
