## Notes

The 3.7cm Pzgr. L/4.1 was a specialized armor-piercing round developed primarily for engaging armored targets but found use in naval applications against lightly armored vessels and aircraft with heavy armor protection. The tungsten carbide core provided excellent penetration performance, capable of defeating the armor of most patrol boats, landing craft, and even light tanks if encountered during shore bombardment operations. In anti-aircraft use, this ammunition could penetrate the increasingly heavy armor being added to ground-attack aircraft and low-level bombers in the latter part of the war. The higher projectile weight compared to HE rounds resulted in identical muzzle velocity due to increased propellant charges. Standard loading practice mixed AP and HE rounds in belts, typically in a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio depending on expected targets.
