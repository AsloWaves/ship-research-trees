## Notes

The 28cm Leuchtgr. was one of the most powerful illumination rounds ever produced, designed to provide long-range battlefield illumination for the Scharnhorst-class battlecruisers during night surface actions. The enormous 28-kilogram illuminant charge produced extraordinary brightness visible from dozens of kilometers away, capable of illuminating vast areas of ocean. The 80-second burn time allowed sustained observation and fire control throughout extended engagement sequences. During operations in northern waters where darkness prevailed for much of the year, this capability was invaluable. The massive parachute required sophisticated engineering to deploy reliably at high altitude and slow the heavy flare's descent. Scharnhorst used star shells during multiple night actions, including the Battle of North Cape where illumination rounds helped identify targets despite Arctic darkness and weather conditions. The high muzzle velocity allowed placement of star shells at extreme ranges, illuminating enemy forces before they could effectively return fire. German doctrine emphasized firing patterns of multiple star shells to maintain continuous illumination and prevent enemies from escaping into darkness between flare burnouts. The tremendous brightness could also serve a blinding effect, dazzling enemy range-finders and fire control personnel. Ships typically allocated 3-5% of main battery capacity to star shells.
