## Notes

The 2cm Spgr. L'Spur was the standard high-explosive tracer ammunition for German light anti-aircraft guns mounted on Kriegsmarine vessels. The tracer element allowed gunners to observe shot trajectories and adjust fire, crucial for engaging fast-moving aircraft. This ammunition was extensively used on virtually every German warship from E-boats to battleships. The Flakvierling 38 quad mount firing this ammunition provided devastating short-range anti-aircraft defense, with a combined cyclic rate exceeding 1,800 rounds per minute. Despite its small bursting charge, the high rate of fire made it effective against aircraft and small surface craft.
