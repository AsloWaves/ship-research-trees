## Notes

The 28cm Pzgr. L/4.4 was the armor-piercing shell used by the Scharnhorst-class battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Despite the smaller caliber compared to contemporary battleships, these shells achieved excellent penetration performance through high muzzle velocity. The shells featured advanced German cap design with both armor-piercing and ballistic caps. These shells were used in numerous engagements including the Battle of North Cape where Scharnhorst was sunk in December 1943, and the sinking of HMS Glorious in June 1940.
