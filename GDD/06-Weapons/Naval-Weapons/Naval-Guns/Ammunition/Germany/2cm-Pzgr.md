## Notes

The 2cm Pzgr. was developed primarily for anti-armor use but found extensive application aboard Kriegsmarine vessels for engaging lightly armored targets such as motor torpedo boats, landing craft, and aircraft. The hardened steel core could penetrate light armor plating and was particularly effective against the thin hull plating of patrol boats and the cockpit armor of attacking aircraft. While less commonly loaded than the HE-tracer rounds in naval AA mounts, belts typically included a mix of AP and HE ammunition to provide flexibility against different target types. The higher weight compared to HE rounds resulted in slightly lower muzzle velocity but better penetration performance.
