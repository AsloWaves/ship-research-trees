## Notes

The 10.5cm Spgr. Zt was a time-fused variant of the standard 10.5cm AA shell, featuring a mechanical time fuse that could be set before firing to detonate at a specific altitude or time. This allowed for barrage fire against aircraft formations at predetermined altitudes. The slightly reduced bursting charge compared to the standard Spgr. L/4.4 was due to space required for the time fuse mechanism. These shells were used extensively during attacks by RAF Bomber Command on German capital ships, particularly during raids on Tirpitz in 1944.
