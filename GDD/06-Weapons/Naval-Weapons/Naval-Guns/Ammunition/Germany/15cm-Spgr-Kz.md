## Notes

The 15cm Spgr. Kz was a specialized base-fused high-explosive shell designed for improved penetration before detonation. The "Kz" (Kurzzunder) designation indicates a base fuse with delayed action, allowing the shell to penetrate light armor or ship structure before detonating. This made it particularly effective against destroyers and light vessels with thin armor. The increased bursting charge compared to the standard Spgr. L/4.5 provided enhanced destructive effect once inside the target structure.
