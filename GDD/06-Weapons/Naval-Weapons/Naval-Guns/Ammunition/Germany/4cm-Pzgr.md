## Notes

The 4cm Pzgr. was German-manufactured armor-piercing ammunition for captured Bofors guns, designed to engage armored targets including landing craft, patrol boats, and heavily-armored ground-attack aircraft. The solid hardened steel projectile could defeat armor significantly thicker than the 3.7cm AP rounds, making it effective against a wider range of targets. In naval service, this ammunition proved particularly valuable during actions against Allied motor torpedo boats and armored landing craft during the Normandy invasion period. The penetration performance was sufficient to defeat the armor of most light armored vehicles and could penetrate the hull plating of destroyers at close range. Standard practice loaded mixed belts with AP and HE rounds, typically 1:2 or 1:3 ratios. The captured Bofors guns using this ammunition provided German vessels with effective multi-role capability in the intermediate caliber range during the final years of the war.
