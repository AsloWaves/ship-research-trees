## Notes

The 15cm Leuchtgr. was the standard illumination round for German light cruisers armed with 15cm main batteries, including the Königsberg, Leipzig, and Nürnberg classes. The massive illuminant charge produced exceptional brightness, capable of illuminating large areas of ocean for extended periods. The 60-second burn time was among the longest of any naval star shell in service during World War II, allowing sustained observation and fire control. German cruiser doctrine emphasized night fighting capabilities, and extensive training was conducted in the use of star shells for night surface actions. The time fuze could be set to eject the parachute flare at any desired altitude, typically 1,500-2,500 meters depending on tactical requirements and weather conditions. These rounds saw extensive use during night actions in the Baltic, North Sea, and Norwegian coastal waters. The brilliant illumination also served a defensive purpose, as star shells fired ahead of approaching enemy destroyers could silhouette them while keeping the firing ship in relative darkness. Cruisers typically allocated 8-12% of main battery ammunition to star shells.
