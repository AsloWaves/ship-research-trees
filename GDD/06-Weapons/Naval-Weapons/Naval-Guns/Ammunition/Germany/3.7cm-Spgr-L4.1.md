## Notes

The 3.7cm Spgr. L/4.1 was developed for the new generation of automatic 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns introduced in 1943 to bridge the gap between the 2cm and 4cm weapons. This ammunition represented a significant improvement over earlier 3.7cm rounds, featuring a more powerful bursting charge and higher muzzle velocity. The Flak M42 and M43 guns firing this ammunition were mounted on late-war U-boats, destroyers, and auxiliary vessels as intermediate anti-aircraft weapons. The fully automatic feed system allowed sustained high rates of fire, making these weapons effective against both aircraft and small surface targets. The larger bursting charge compared to 2cm ammunition provided better fragmentation and destructive effect, while the high velocity ensured flat trajectory and reduced time-of-flight to target.
