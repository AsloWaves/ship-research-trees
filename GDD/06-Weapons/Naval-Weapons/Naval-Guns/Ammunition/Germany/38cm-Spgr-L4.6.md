## Notes

The 38cm Spgr. L/4.6 was the high-explosive shell for Bismarck-class battleships, designed for shore bombardment and use against unarmored or lightly armored targets. The shell featured a base-detonating fuse and contained significantly more explosive than the armor-piercing variant. Despite the same overall weight as the AP shell, the HE variant achieved this through thinner walls and larger explosive cavity. Used primarily during shore bombardment operations in the Arctic theater by Tirpitz.
