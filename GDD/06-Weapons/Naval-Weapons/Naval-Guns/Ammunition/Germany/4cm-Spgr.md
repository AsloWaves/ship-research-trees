## Notes

The 4cm Spgr. was German-manufactured ammunition for captured Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns, which were widely employed by the Kriegsmarine after the occupation of Norway, Netherlands, and Belgium. The Bofors 40mm was recognized as superior to contemporary German designs in the intermediate caliber range, and captured weapons were eagerly integrated into German naval defenses. German ammunition plants produced compatible ammunition using domestic explosive compounds and manufacturing techniques. The larger bursting charge compared to 3.7cm rounds provided significantly improved anti-aircraft effectiveness, with better fragmentation patterns and destructive effect against aircraft structures. These weapons and their ammunition saw extensive service on armed merchant cruisers, auxiliary vessels, U-boats, and harbor defense installations throughout 1944-1945. The reliable Bofors mechanism and effective German-produced ammunition made these weapons highly valued by crews.
