## Notes

The 8.8cm Spgr. Zt. was specifically designed for anti-aircraft use with a sophisticated mechanical time fuze (Zeitzünder) that could be precisely set before firing to detonate at a predetermined point in the projectile's trajectory. The fuze mechanism was set using a fuze-setting machine integrated with the gun's fire control system, allowing accurate airburst placement near target aircraft. This was significantly more effective than impact-fuzed rounds, as the airburst created a spherical fragmentation pattern that didn't require a direct hit. In naval service, the time-fuzed rounds were essential for engaging high-altitude bomber formations where impact hits were unlikely. The fuze could be set for times between 0 and 30 seconds, corresponding to slant ranges up to approximately 12,000 meters. Later in the war, improved Dopp Z fuzes with self-destruct mechanisms were introduced to prevent hazardous duds. This ammunition was critical to the anti-aircraft defense of major German warships throughout the conflict.
