## Notes

The 28cm Spgr. L/4.4 was the high-explosive shell for Scharnhorst-class battleships. Used primarily for shore bombardment and against unarmored or lightly armored targets. The shell featured a base-detonating fuse and achieved good fragmentation characteristics. Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau used these shells during various operations including the bombardment of Allied positions during the Norwegian Campaign and Channel Dash operations in 1942.
