## Notes

The 2cm Brandgr. was developed as a specialized anti-aircraft round designed to ignite fuel tanks and hydraulic systems in aircraft. The incendiary compound would scatter on impact, creating multiple ignition points that could spread fire throughout an aircraft's structure. In naval service, these rounds were particularly valued for engaging fuel-laden torpedo bombers and for setting fire to wooden-hulled vessels. The ammunition was typically mixed with HE-tracer rounds in belts at a ratio of approximately 1:3 or 1:4. The lighter projectile weight resulted in the highest muzzle velocity of the 2cm ammunition family. During the defense of capital ships against concentrated air attacks in 1944-1945, incendiary ammunition proved highly effective when multiple hits could be achieved on attacking aircraft.
