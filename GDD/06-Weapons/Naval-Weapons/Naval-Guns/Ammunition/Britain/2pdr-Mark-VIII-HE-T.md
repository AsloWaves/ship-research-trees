## Notes

High explosive tracer variant of the 2-pounder pom-pom ammunition, introduced in 1936 to improve fire control through visual trajectory observation. Fired at 2,400 fps muzzle velocity. The tracer element burned for approximately 4-5 seconds, creating a visible stream of fire that allowed gun crews to track their rounds and adjust aim rapidly. This was particularly important given the high rate of fire and the need for quick corrections when engaging fast-moving aircraft. Standard loading practice was to include one HE-T round for every 3-4 standard HE rounds in the ammunition feed. The distinctive streams of tracer fire from octuple pom-pom mountings became an iconic image of Royal Navy anti-aircraft defense during the Battle of Britain and Mediterranean campaigns. The psychological effect of massed tracer fire on attacking pilots was considered almost as valuable as the physical damage inflicted.
