## Notes

High-explosive shell for British 6-inch cruiser guns. Used TNT or Shellite D filling. Designed for use against destroyers, shore targets, and unarmored vessels. The high explosive content made it particularly effective for shore bombardment operations in the Mediterranean and during D-Day landings. Standard loading for light cruisers included a mix of CPC and HE shells to handle different tactical situations.
