## Notes

Modern APC shell designed for the King George V-class battleships equipped with the 14"/45 Mark VII gun. Featured 6crh streamlined design representing the pinnacle of British pre-war shell design. Fired at 2,483 fps muzzle velocity. Used by HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Duke of York (which sank Scharnhorst), and sister ships. The quadruple turret arrangement of these ships made fire control particularly challenging but effective.
