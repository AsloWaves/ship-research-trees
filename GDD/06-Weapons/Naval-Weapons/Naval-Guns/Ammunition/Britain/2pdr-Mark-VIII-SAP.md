## Notes

Semi-armor piercing variant of the 2-pounder pom-pom ammunition, designed for engaging lightly armored aircraft and surface targets. Fired at 2,400 fps muzzle velocity. The SAP shell featured a hardened nose section that could penetrate light armor before detonating the bursting charge inside the target - a characteristic British approach to ammunition design. While primarily an anti-aircraft weapon, the pom-pom with SAP ammunition proved effective against E-boats and other light surface craft in coastal waters. The SAP round was less commonly loaded than the standard HE, typically comprising about 25% of ready ammunition to provide flexibility against various target types. The combination of penetration and explosive effect made SAP rounds particularly lethal against aircraft engines and fuel systems.
