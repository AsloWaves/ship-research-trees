## Notes

Star shell (illumination round) for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun, essential for night surface actions and convoy defense operations. Fired at 2,660 fps muzzle velocity, the shell would reach its set altitude (typically 3,000-5,000 feet) where a time fuze would eject a magnesium flare suspended on a small parachute. The flare burned at 400,000 candlepower for approximately 40 seconds, illuminating an area of several square miles and revealing enemy vessels or aircraft to fire control systems and gun crews. Star shells were crucial during the numerous night surface actions in the Mediterranean and during convoy operations against U-boats. Destroyers typically carried a proportion of star shells in their ready ammunition - usually 10-15% of total rounds. The effectiveness of British night fighting tactics, particularly in actions like the Second Battle of Sirte, owed much to effective star shell illumination.
