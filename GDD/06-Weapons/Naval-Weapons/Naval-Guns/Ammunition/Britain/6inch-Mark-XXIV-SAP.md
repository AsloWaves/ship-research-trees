## Notes

Semi-armor piercing round for the BL 6-inch Mark XXIII gun, exemplifying British ammunition design philosophy that favored dual-purpose effectiveness. Fired at 2,758 fps muzzle velocity. The Mark XXIV SAP combined a hardened nose for armor penetration with a doubled bursting charge compared to the APC variant (4.48 lbs vs 2.24 lbs), making it effective against both armored cruisers and unarmored targets. Could still penetrate 100mm of armor at 10,000 yards while delivering significantly better high-explosive effect. This became the preferred loading for most engagements, with cruisers typically carrying more SAP than APC in their magazines. The Mark XXIV proved highly effective in the Mediterranean theater, where British cruisers frequently engaged Italian destroyers and shore targets where the enhanced HE effect was valuable. The round remained standard through the post-war period, seeing action in Korea where its effectiveness in shore bombardment was particularly noted.
