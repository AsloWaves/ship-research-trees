## Notes

Semi-armor piercing shell for the BL 16-inch Mark I gun on HMS Vanguard, Britain's last and most powerful battleship. Fired at 2,614 fps muzzle velocity from 45-caliber barrels. The Mark III SAP represented the culmination of British semi-armor piercing ammunition development, combining excellent armor penetration with a massive bursting charge. The 71.25 lb bursting charge (3.0% of shell weight) was over five times larger than the pure APC variant, providing devastating post-penetration effect while retaining the ability to penetrate 360mm of armor at 20,000 yards - more than adequate for engaging any cruiser or destroyer. The SAP design philosophy reflected lessons learned during WWII, where pure armor-piercing shells often proved less effective than semi-armor piercing rounds in most combat scenarios. However, HMS Vanguard never fired her guns in anger, commissioning in 1946 after the war's end. The ship conducted extensive gunnery trials with the Mark III SAP, demonstrating exceptional accuracy and destructive power. Vanguard remained in active service through 1960, representing the ultimate expression of British battleship design and armament.
