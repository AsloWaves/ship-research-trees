## Notes

Semi-armor piercing shell for the BL 15-inch Mark I gun, developed during WWII to provide improved effectiveness against secondary targets and enhanced post-penetration damage. Fired at 2,450 fps muzzle velocity from Queen Elizabeth-class and Renown-class battleships. The Mark XVII SAP featured a hardened nose for armor penetration combined with a substantially larger bursting charge than earlier APC shells (48.45 lbs vs 13.5 lbs in Mark I APC), making it more effective against lightly armored targets while retaining the ability to penetrate 310mm of armor at 15,000 yards. This made it particularly valuable for shore bombardment operations and engagements with cruisers and destroyers, where the enhanced high-explosive effect was more useful than maximum armor penetration. The Mark XVII saw extensive use during Mediterranean operations, including shore bombardment at Salerno and Normandy, where its superior blast effect proved highly effective against fortifications and troop concentrations. British 15-inch battleships typically loaded a mix of SAP and APC, with SAP favored for most operational scenarios by 1944-45.
