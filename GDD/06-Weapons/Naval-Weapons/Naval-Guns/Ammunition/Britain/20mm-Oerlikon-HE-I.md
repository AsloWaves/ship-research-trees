## Notes

High explosive incendiary variant of the standard Oerlikon 20mm round, introduced in 1941 for enhanced effectiveness against aircraft. Fired at 2,725 fps muzzle velocity. The HE-I combined explosive fragmentation with incendiary effects, making it particularly deadly against fuel tanks and aircraft structures. The incendiary compound (typically phosphorus-based) would ignite upon impact, creating additional damage beyond the explosive effect. This round became the preferred loading for anti-aircraft use, often loaded in mixed belts with tracer rounds for optimal effectiveness. Particularly effective against Japanese aircraft in the Pacific campaign.
