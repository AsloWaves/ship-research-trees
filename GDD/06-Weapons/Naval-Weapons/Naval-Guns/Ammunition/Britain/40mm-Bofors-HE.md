## Notes

Standard high explosive round for the Swedish-designed Bofors 40mm automatic cannon, adopted by the Royal Navy in 1941 as a medium-range anti-aircraft weapon. Fired at 2,890 fps muzzle velocity with an effective ceiling of 23,000 feet. The 40mm Bofors filled the crucial gap between the 20mm Oerlikon and heavier dual-purpose guns, providing effective fire at ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 yards. The HE shell's larger bursting charge compared to 20mm rounds made it significantly more lethal against aircraft, requiring fewer hits for a kill. Widely mounted in twin and quad mountings on British warships from light cruisers to battleships. The Bofors remained in Royal Navy service long after WWII, serving through the Falklands conflict.
