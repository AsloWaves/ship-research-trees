## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the QF 5.25-inch Mark I dual-purpose gun, one of the most powerful illumination rounds in Royal Navy service. Fired at 2,672 fps muzzle velocity with precision time fuzes typically set for bursts at 5,000-7,000 feet altitude. Upon reaching the set height, the fuze would eject a powerful 750,000 candlepower magnesium flare suspended on a parachute, burning for 50 seconds and illuminating an area of 6-7 square miles. This exceptional performance made the 5.25-inch star shell invaluable during night surface actions in northern waters, where extended darkness made night fighting common. The weapon's fire control systems allowed accurate star shell placement even in rough seas. King George V-class battleships used these rounds effectively during Arctic convoy operations and the hunt for German capital ships. The combination of range, illumination power, and accuracy made the 5.25-inch star shell the finest British illumination round of WWII.
