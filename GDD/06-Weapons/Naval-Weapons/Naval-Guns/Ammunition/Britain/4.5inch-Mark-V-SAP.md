## Notes

Semi-armor piercing round for the QF 4.5-inch Mark V gun, representing the British preference for dual-purpose ammunition effective against both surface vessels and aircraft. Fired at 2,449 fps muzzle velocity from destroyers and auxiliary vessels. The SAP design featured a hardened nose section for penetrating light armor and a base-fuzed bursting charge that detonated inside the target, maximizing damage. This made it highly effective against destroyer and cruiser-type targets at typical engagement ranges. The shell could penetrate 80mm of armor at 10,000 yards - sufficient for most destroyer engagements. Widely used on Battle-class, Daring-class, and Weapon-class destroyers, as well as in coastal defense mountings. The 4.5-inch SAP proved particularly effective in surface actions during the Korean War and remained in service through the 1960s on various Royal Navy vessels.
