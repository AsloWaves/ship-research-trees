## Notes

Armor-piercing capped round for the BL 6-inch Mark XXIII gun mounted on Town-class and Colony-class light cruisers. Fired at 2,758 fps muzzle velocity from 50-caliber barrels, giving exceptional range and flat trajectory. The Mark XXIII APC featured a 4crh (caliber radius head) ogive with soft steel cap over a hardened armor-piercing body, designed to defeat face-hardened armor without shattering. Could penetrate 125mm of armor at 10,000 yards - sufficient to defeat the armor of any enemy light cruiser. The relatively small bursting charge (2.0% of shell weight) was typical of British APC design, prioritizing penetration over post-penetration effect. This shell saw extensive action in the Mediterranean, including the Battles of Calabria, Spartivento, and Cape Matapan, where British 6-inch cruisers engaged Italian counterparts. The Mark XXIII APC remained in service through the post-war period on Colony-class cruisers that served in Korea and other Cold War conflicts.
