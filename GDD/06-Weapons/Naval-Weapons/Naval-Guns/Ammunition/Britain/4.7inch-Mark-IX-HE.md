## Notes

High-explosive shell for British 4.7-inch destroyer guns. Filled with TNT or Shellite D. Used for engaging surface targets, shore bombardment, and anti-aircraft barrage fire (though not particularly effective in the AA role). The high explosive content provided good fragmentation effects against unarmored targets and small craft. British destroyers typically carried a substantial proportion of HE ammunition for general purpose use.
