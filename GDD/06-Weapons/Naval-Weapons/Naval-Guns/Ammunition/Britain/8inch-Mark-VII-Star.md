## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the BL 8-inch Mark VIII gun on County-class heavy cruisers, providing the most powerful battlefield illumination capability in the Royal Navy's cruiser force. Fired at 2,805 fps muzzle velocity with maximum range of over 31,000 yards, the star shell could reach altitudes of 8,000-12,000 feet depending on fuze settings. The massive 1.5 million candlepower magnesium flare burned for 70 seconds, illuminating an area of 10-12 square miles - sufficient to reveal an entire enemy formation. This capability was crucial during night surface actions, where British heavy cruisers often operated independently or in small squadrons. The 8-inch star shell saw dramatic use during the hunt for Bismarck, where HMS Norfolk and Suffolk used star shells to maintain contact during the long May 1941 night pursuit through the Denmark Strait. County-class cruisers typically carried 5-8% of their 8-inch ammunition as star shells, maintaining ready rounds in each turret for immediate illumination capability during night encounters.
