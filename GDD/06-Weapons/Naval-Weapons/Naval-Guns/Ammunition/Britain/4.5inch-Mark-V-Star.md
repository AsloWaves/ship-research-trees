## Notes

Star shell illumination round for the QF 4.5-inch Mark V gun, essential for night surface warfare and anti-aircraft operations. Fired at 2,449 fps muzzle velocity, the shell would be time-fuzed to burst at the desired altitude (typically 4,000-6,000 feet), ejecting a powerful magnesium flare suspended on a parachute. The 500,000 candlepower flare burned for approximately 45 seconds, illuminating an area of 4-5 square miles - significantly larger than the 4-inch star shell. This capability was crucial during night actions, particularly in the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters where British destroyers frequently engaged in night surface battles. Destroyers typically maintained 10-15% of their ammunition as star shells for illumination duties. The improved performance of the 4.5-inch star shell compared to earlier 4-inch rounds made it highly valued, remaining in Royal Navy service through the Korean War and into the 1960s for night shore bombardment spotting.
