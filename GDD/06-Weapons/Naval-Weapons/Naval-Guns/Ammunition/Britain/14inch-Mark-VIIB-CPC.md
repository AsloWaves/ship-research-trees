## Notes

Common Pointed Capped shell for the BL 14-inch Mark VII gun mounted on King George V-class battleships. Fired at 2,483 fps muzzle velocity from 45-caliber barrels. The Mark VIIB CPC represented improved British semi-armor piercing design, combining moderate armor penetration with enhanced high-explosive effect compared to pure APC shells. The 47.7 lb bursting charge (3.0% of shell weight) was three times that of the APC variant, making it significantly more effective against lightly armored targets and providing devastating post-penetration damage. Could still penetrate 280mm of armor at 15,000 yards - adequate for most cruiser and destroyer engagements. British doctrine typically loaded CPC shells for long-range fire and secondary targets, with pure APC reserved for close-range engagements with enemy battleships. The KGV-class battleships used this ammunition extensively during WWII, including during the pursuit of Bismarck (HMS King George V and Prince of Wales) and the sinking of Scharnhorst (HMS Duke of York, December 1943). The CPC's effectiveness against Scharnhorst's superstructure was particularly noted.
