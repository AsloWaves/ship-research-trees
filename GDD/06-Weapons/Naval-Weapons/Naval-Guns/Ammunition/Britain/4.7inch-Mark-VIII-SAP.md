Standard semi-armor-piercing shell for British destroyers equipped with 4.7"/45 guns. Used on A-class through I-class destroyers and early Tribal-class destroyers. Fired at 2,650 fps muzzle velocity. The SAP design provided reasonable penetration against destroyer-caliber armor while maintaining useful fragmentation effects. These shells saw extensive service in destroyer actions throughout WWII, including numerous engagements in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic.
