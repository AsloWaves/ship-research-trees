- 48-hour reconsideration window
- Cannot engage in combat during this period
- Can cancel defection without penalty

**Step 2: Financial Penalty**:
- **Base Fee**: 50,000 credits
- **Equipment Confiscation**: Nation-specific items locked
  - Can keep universal items (standard guns, engines)
  - Lose nation-specific technology (radars, special torpedoes)
  - Premium ships may be confiscated (based on value)
- **Total Cost**: Typically 100,000-250,000 credits equivalent

**Step 3: Reputation Impact**:
- **Former Nation**: Reputation drops to -75 (Traitor status)
  - Permanent reputation cap of -50 (can never be truly trusted again)
  - Hostile NPC encounters in former nation waters
  - Port access denied in former nation territories
- **New Nation**: Start at -25 (Suspicious Foreigner)
  - Must prove loyalty through actions
  - Can rebuild to full reputation over time

**Step 4: Integration Requirements**:
- Complete 10 loyalty missions for new nation
- Maintain positive behavior (no friendly fire)
- 30-day probation period before full benefits
- New nation starting ship provided (T1 destroyer)

**Step 5: Strategic Consequences**:
- Permanent restricted access to former nation technology
- Lose faction-specific currency (Resource Points reset to 0)
- Former allies may treat you with suspicion
- Strategic intelligence known to former nation (they know your tactics)

**Example: US → Japanese Defection**:
```
Commander Johnson's Defection:

Motivations:
- Prefers Japanese aggressive playstyle
- Wants access to Long Lance torpedoes
- Allied with Japanese player corporation

Financial Costs:
- Base defection fee: 50,000 credits
- Confiscated USS Fletcher: 45,000 credits
- Confiscated US radar: 15,000 credits
- Total Loss: 110,000 credits

Reputation Impact:
- US Navy: +65 → -75 (betrayal penalty)
- Japanese Navy: 0 → -25 (start as suspicious)
- British Navy: +20 → -10 (allied with betrayed nation)
- German Navy: -30 → -20 (enemy of former nation, slight improvement)

Integration Process:
- Received IJN Fubuki (T1 starter destroyer)
- Complete 10 Japanese loyalty missions over 14 days
- Reputation climbs to +35 with Japan
- After 90 days: Full integration, access to tech tree

Long-term Consequences:
- Permanently banned from US ports (cannot return home)
- US players may hunt as traitor (bounty system)
