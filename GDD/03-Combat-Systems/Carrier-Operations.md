## Document Purpose

This document details the complete carrier operations system for Fathoms Deep, covering aircraft management, flight deck operations, squadron command, air-to-air combat, strike coordination, and carrier vulnerability in extraction-based gameplay.

---

## The Carrier Experience

Command a floating airbase projecting power across hundreds of kilometers while managing complex flight operations, resource logistics, and multi-domain threats. Carrier gameplay balances strategic positioning, tactical air operations, and vulnerable extraction phases.

**Key Challenges**:
- Complex multi-squadron coordination
- Resource-intensive operations (fuel, ammunition, aircraft)
- Vulnerable to submarines and surface ambush
- High-stakes extraction with valuable aircraft inventory
- Crew-intensive operations requiring specialized personnel

---

## Carrier Tier Progression & Class Types

### Unlock Requirements

**Carrier Access** requires researching the **Sims-Class Destroyer** first, then spending research points on your chosen carrier line (no arbitrary credit costs). This research tree progression ensures players understand basic naval operations before commanding complex carrier operations.

**Research Tree Flow**:
- Progress through early destroyer lines
- Research Sims-Class Destroyer (prerequisite for carriers and battleships)
- Unlock carrier tree (starts with Langley-Class)
- Continue researching carriers using research points only

**Why Carriers Require Destroyer Experience:**
1. **Complexity**: Multi-domain operations require tactical understanding developed in destroyers
2. **High Cost**: Carriers are expensive to operate and catastrophic to lose
3. **Strategic Value**: Carriers change battlefield dynamics, require operational maturity

**Note**: The following mechanics (Movement Controls, Aircraft Management, etc.) apply to ALL carrier tiers, but scale in complexity and capability as tier increases.

---

## Carrier Movement Controls - Strategic Positioning

### Semi-Auto Movement - Precision Maneuvering

**Use Case**: Combat situations requiring precise positioning and immediate course changes

**Control Features**:
- **Waypoint Setting**: Right-click to set navigation waypoints with immediate response
- **Speed Control**: F key (increase speed) / V key (decrease speed) for manual throttle management
- **Continuous Movement**: Ship maintains last bearing and speed after reaching waypoint
- **Course Correction**: Must actively set new waypoints to change direction

**Tactical Applications**:
- Maintaining optimal distance from enemy surface ships (80-120km)
- Quick course changes to avoid submarine threats
- Precise positioning for aircraft recovery operations

#### **Example Scenario: USS Hornet Operating in Contested Pacific Waters**

USS Hornet detects German surface raiders approaching from northwest. Captain switches to Semi-Auto, sets series of waypoints to maintain 90km separation while keeping into-wind heading for aircraft operations. Manual speed control allows optimization of fuel consumption while maintaining tactical flexibility.

---

### Auto Movement - Operational Efficiency

**Use Case**: Long-range transit and sustained flight operations

**Control Features**:
- **Single Waypoint**: Right-click sets destination with automatic pathfinding and speed optimization
- **Automatic Speed**: Ship calculates optimal speed for fuel efficiency and arrival timing
- **Full Stop**: Automatically stops upon reaching destination to conserve fuel
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Frees player attention for complex aircraft management

**Strategic Benefits**: Allows focus on air operations during extended missions

#### **Example Scenario: HMS Ark Royal Long-Range Transit**

HMS Ark Royal sets Auto-movement waypoint 200km northeast to intercept Italian convoy. Auto-speed maintains 18 knots for optimal fuel consumption. Captain focuses on preparing 3 torpedo bomber wings and 2 fighter escort wings while ship transits autonomously. Upon arrival, switches to Semi-Auto for tactical maneuvering during air operations.

- **T10 Apex Carrier** (Ultimate): 8-10 wings, 120+ total aircraft

---

### Crew Card Assignment & Wing Operations

#### **Minimum Crew Requirements to Leave Port**

**CRITICAL**: Only **2 crew cards** required to leave port:
- **Bridge Operator** (1 crew card) - Required for ship navigation and control
- **Engine Operator** (1 crew card) - Required for propulsion

**No other crew card restrictions** - Players can leave port with minimal crew, but combat effectiveness depends on crew card assignments to positions.

---

#### **Wing Crew Card Requirements**

**Each Wing Requires 1 Aviation Crew Card Assigned**:
- **Fighter Wing**: Requires 1 Fighter Pilot crew card (Dogfighting stat 7-50)
- **Dive Bomber Wing**: Requires 1 Bomber Pilot crew card (Bombing Accuracy stat 7-50)
- **Torpedo Bomber Wing**: Requires 1 Torpedo Pilot crew card (Torpedo Accuracy stat 7-50)

**Wing Cannot Launch Without Crew Card**: If no crew card assigned to wing hardpoint, that wing cannot conduct operations.

**Crew Card Stat Impact** (7-50 stat system, see [[Crew-Skills]]):
- **Fighter Pilot Dogfighting stat 50** (legendary): +70% air-to-air effectiveness, -60% prep time
- **Bomber Pilot Accuracy stat 50** (legendary): +70% bombing accuracy, -60% prep time
- **Torpedo Pilot Accuracy stat 50** (legendary): +70% torpedo hit chance, -60% prep time
- **Rookie stats 7-10**: -25% to -15% accuracy, +25% fuel consumption, higher loss rates

**Wing Size Variation by Carrier**:
- **Small Carriers** (T1-T3): 4-6 aircraft per wing
- **Medium Carriers** (T4-T6): 8-12 aircraft per wing
- **Large Carriers** (T7-T9): 10-15 aircraft per wing
- **Super Carriers** (T10): 12-18 aircraft per wing

**Crew Card Assignment Example (USS Essex T5)**:
- Wing 1: Level 75 Fighter Pilot crew card (stat 35) → 12 F6F Hellcats
- Wing 2: Level 50 Fighter Pilot crew card (stat 28) → 12 F6F Hellcats
- Wing 3: Level 90 Bomber Pilot crew card (stat 42) → 12 SBD Dauntless
- Wing 4: Level 60 Bomber Pilot crew card (stat 31) → 12 SBD Dauntless
- Wing 5: Level 100 Torpedo Pilot crew card (stat 45) → 12 TBF Avengers
- Wing 6: Level 45 Torpedo Pilot crew card (stat 26) → 12 TBF Avengers
- **Total**: 6 aviation crew cards control 72 aircraft across 6 wings

## Inventory Requirements - Tetris Logistics

### Aircraft Storage System

**Physical Aircraft Inventory Management**:
- **F6F Hellcat**: 2x3 inventory spaces (6 grid cells) - Medium fighter
- **SBD Dauntless**: 2x4 inventory spaces (8 grid cells) - Dive bomber
- **TBF Avenger**: 3x4 inventory spaces (12 grid cells) - Large torpedo bomber
- **A6M Zero**: 2x2 inventory spaces (4 grid cells) - Compact fighter

**Aircraft Inventory Usage**:
- **Active Wings**: Aircraft currently assigned to wing slots (ready for launch)
- **Spare Aircraft**: Extra aircraft stored in cargo inventory for replacing combat losses
- **Salvaged Aircraft**: Captured or recovered aircraft stored for later use/sale

**Storage Optimization Example**:

USS Enterprise (60 grid cell aircraft inventory) optimally carries:
- 6 Hellcats (36 grid cells) - 3 for active wings, 3 as spares
- 2 Dauntless (16 grid cells) - 1 active, 1 spare
- 1 Avenger (8 grid cells) - Active wing aircraft
- **Total**: 54/60 grid cells used, 6 spare grid cells for additional replacements or valuable loot

**Strategic Planning**:
- Carriers must balance active aircraft vs. spare aircraft vs. cargo space
- More spares = safer long deployments but less profitable cargo capacity
- See [[Aircraft Replacement System]] below for spare aircraft mechanics

---

### Aviation Resource Management

#### **Aviation Fuel (Separate from Ship Fuel)**

**CRITICAL**: Aviation fuel is **completely separate** from ship propulsion fuel and must be stored in carrier cargo inventory.

**Aviation Fuel Types** (stored in cargo grid):
- **100-Octane Aviation Gasoline**: 1x2 grid cells, stack to 100/stack, 2-4 fuel units per flight hour per aircraft
- **High-Performance Fuel**: 1x2 grid cells, stack to 50/stack, 3-6 fuel units per hour, +15% aircraft performance
- **Emergency Fuel**: 1x1 grid cells, stack to 200/stack, 1 unit per hour, -25% performance, risk of engine failure

**Fuel Requirement to Launch Wings**:
- Wings **cannot launch** without sufficient aviation fuel in carrier inventory
- Each wing requires fuel allocation before launch (assigned in Wing Assignment Page)
- Running out of aviation fuel mid-mission grounds aircraft until resupply

**Example Fuel Planning (6-hour sortie with 3 wings)**:
- 3 wings × 12 aircraft/wing = 36 aircraft total
- 36 aircraft × 3 fuel units/hour × 6 hours = **648 aviation fuel units needed**
- Storage: 7 stacks of 100-Octane (700 units) consumes 14 cargo grid cells

---

#### **Ammunition Storage (Tetris Inventory)**

**Ordnance Inventory Items** (stored in cargo grid per [[Inventory-System]]):
- **250lb Bombs**: 1x2 grid cells, stack to 10/stack, general purpose munitions
- **500lb Bombs**: 2x2 grid cells, stack to 5/stack, heavy anti-ship ordnance
- **Aerial Torpedoes**: 2x4 grid cells, stack to 3/stack, devastating ship-killers
- **.50 Cal Ammunition**: 1x1 grid cells, stack to 1000/stack, bulk fighter ammunition
- **20mm Cannon Shells**: 1x2 grid cells, stack to 500/stack, heavy fighter ammunition

**Ammunition is OPTIONAL** for launch:
- Wings can launch without ammunition (reconnaissance, CAP, relocation)
- Combat effectiveness requires appropriate ammunition loaded
- Ammunition assigned per wing in Wing Assignment Page (see below)

#### **Maintenance Supplies**

**Essential Maintenance Items**:
- **Engine Parts**: 2x2 grid cells, critical for sustained operations
- **Structural Components**: 1x3 grid cells, airframe repairs
- **Electronics**: 1x1 grid cells, radio and navigation equipment
- **Hydraulic Fluid**: 1x1 grid cells, landing gear and flight controls

## Launch Preparation System - Deck Operations

### Preparation Time Factors

**Base Preparation Times** (experienced crew):
- **Fighter Wing**: 8 minutes - Simple armament, quick turnaround
- **Dive Bomber Wing**: 12 minutes - Complex bomb loading procedures
- **Torpedo Bomber Wing**: 15 minutes - Delicate torpedo installation

**Modifying Factors**:
- **Crew Stats** (Engineer Repair Speed stat 7-50): Stat 50 reduces time by ~60%, stat 7 increases by 25%
- **Aircraft Condition**: Well-maintained aircraft -20% time, damaged aircraft +100% time
- **Weather Conditions**: Rough seas +50% time, calm conditions -10% time
- **Combat Stress**: Under fire +30% preparation time

**Launch Limitation Examples**:
- **Essex-Class**: 3 wings simultaneously ready (large deck capacity)
- **Illustrious-Class**: 2 wings simultaneously ready (armored deck limits)
- **Shokaku-Class**: 4 wings simultaneously ready (efficient operations)

## Wing Assignment Page - Pre-Launch Configuration

### Overview

The **Wing Assignment Page** is where players configure wings before launch by designating aviation fuel and ammunition from carrier cargo inventory. This is accessed before initiating launch preparation.

### Wing Configuration Interface

**For Each Wing, Players Must Assign**:

1. **Crew Card Assignment** (Required):
   - Drag crew card from crew roster to wing slot
   - Must match wing type (Fighter Pilot → Fighter Wing, Bomber Pilot → Bomber Wing, etc.)
   - **Wing cannot launch without crew card**

2. **Aviation Fuel Allocation** (Required):
   - Designate fuel amount from carrier inventory
   - Pulled from 100-Octane, High-Performance, or Emergency Fuel stacks
   - **Wing cannot launch without fuel allocation**
   - Recommended: Allocate 150-200% of estimated mission fuel (safety margin)

3. **Ammunition Assignment** (Optional):
   - Select ammunition type and quantity from carrier inventory
   - Fighter wings: Designate .50 Cal or 20mm Cannon Shells
   - Dive Bomber wings: Designate 250lb or 500lb Bombs
   - Torpedo Bomber wings: Designate Aerial Torpedoes
   - **Wing can launch without ammo** (reconnaissance/relocation missions)

### Example Wing Assignment (USS Essex Strike Mission)

**Wing 1 - Fighter Escort (F6F Hellcat)**:
- Crew Card: Level 75 Fighter Pilot (Dogfighting stat 35)
- Aviation Fuel: 288 units (12 aircraft × 3 units/hour × 8 hours)
- Ammunition: 12,000 rounds .50 Cal (12 stacks)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to launch

**Wing 3 - Dive Bomber Strike (SBD Dauntless)**:
- Crew Card: Level 90 Bomber Pilot (Bombing Accuracy stat 42)
- Aviation Fuel: 384 units (12 aircraft × 4 units/hour × 8 hours)
- Ammunition: 24× 500lb Bombs (5 stacks from inventory)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to launch

**Wing 5 - Torpedo Strike (TBF Avenger)**:
- Crew Card: Level 100 Torpedo Pilot (Torpedo Accuracy stat 45)
- Aviation Fuel: 576 units (12 aircraft × 6 units/hour × 8 hours - heavy fuel consumption)
- Ammunition: 12× Aerial Torpedoes (4 stacks from inventory)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to launch

**Wing 2 - Reconnaissance (F6F Hellcat)**:
- Crew Card: Level 50 Fighter Pilot (Dogfighting stat 28)
- Aviation Fuel: 216 units (12 aircraft × 3 units/hour × 6 hours)
- Ammunition: **None** (reconnaissance only, no combat expected)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to launch (no ammo needed for recon)

### Resource Deduction

**When Wings Launch**:
- Aviation fuel **immediately deducted** from carrier inventory
- Ammunition **immediately deducted** from carrier inventory
- Resources cannot be recovered unless wing returns to carrier
- Lost aircraft = lost fuel + ammunition

**Resource Management Strategy**:
- Always maintain 20-30% fuel reserve in inventory
- Stock multiple ammunition types for tactical flexibility
- Balance cargo space between fuel, ammunition, and valuable cargo

---

### Queue Management Scenarios

**Priority System**:
1. **Emergency CAP (Combat Air Patrol)**: Immediate launch for carrier defense
2. **Coordinated Strike**: All wings launched simultaneously for maximum impact
3. **Routine Operations**: Standard mission launches with proper sequencing
4. **Recovery Operations**: Landing aircraft always have priority over launches

#### **Example Operation: HMS Illustrious Major Strike**

HMS Illustrious prepares major strike against Italian battleship:
1. **Wing 1 (Fighters)** and **Wing 3 (Torpedo bombers)** set to "Ready" status
2. **Wing 2 (Fighter-bombers)** queued for launch after Wing 1 clears deck
3. **Wing 4** remains in reserve for carrier defense
4. **Total coordination time**: 20 minutes from decision to all wings airborne

---

## Flight Operations - Tactical Air Command

### Aircraft Control Interface - Squadron Command

#### **Wing Selection & Command**

**Control Hierarchy**:
- **Tab Cycling**: Quickly switch between active wings for rapid command changes
- **Wing Status Display**: Real-time fuel, ammunition, damage, and morale status
- **Formation Commands**: Loose formation (speed), tight formation (accuracy), combat spread
- **Altitude Control**: Low-level (stealth), medium altitude (balanced), high altitude (range)

---

### Advanced Waypoint System

**Waypoint Types**:
- **Navigation Waypoint**: Simple movement command
- **Search Pattern**: Automated reconnaissance sweeps
- **Attack Waypoint**: Designated strike coordinates with attack parameters
- **Rally Point**: Regrouping location after attack completion
- **Emergency Landing**: Alternate carrier or land base for damaged aircraft

**Attack Parameter Configuration**:
- **Approach Vector**: Direction of attack run (crucial for torpedo drops)
- **Attack Altitude**: High altitude (accuracy) vs. Low altitude (surprise)
- **Coordination Timing**: Simultaneous strikes vs. Sequential attacks
- **Escape Route**: Pre-planned withdrawal path after attack

---

### Tactical Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Coordinated Strike on Enemy Battleship**
**Target**: KMS Bismarck at 85km range

**Strike Coordination**:
1. **Fighter Wing**: Launched first, establishes air superiority 20km ahead of target
2. **Dive Bomber Wing**: High altitude approach from southeast, attack run from sun
3. **Torpedo Wing**: Low altitude approach from northwest, coordinated with dive bombers
4. **Timing**: Fighters engage escorts, dive bombers attack at T+0, torpedoes attack at T+30 seconds
5. **Result**: Overwhelmed defenses, multiple hits, successful extraction

---

#### **Scenario 2: Defensive Combat Air Patrol**
**Threat**: Incoming Japanese air raid detected at 40km

**Defensive Operations**:
1. **Emergency Launch**: 2 fighter wings scrambled in 6 minutes
2. **Intercept Course**: Fighters vectored to intercept 25km from carrier
3. **Engagement**: 18 Zeros vs. 16 Hellcats, numerical disadvantage but superior aircraft
4. **Defensive Success**: 12 enemy aircraft shot down, 3 friendly losses, carrier protected

---

## Communication & Range Management

### Radio Equipment Tiers

**Basic Radio Suite** (Standard Equipment):
- **Control Range**: 50km radius - adequate for local operations
- **Clarity**: Clear communication within 30km, static beyond
- **Aircraft Capacity**: Control 4 wings simultaneously

**Advanced Communication Array** (Module Upgrade):
- **Control Range**: 100km radius - extended operational reach
- **Clarity**: Clear communication throughout range
- **Aircraft Capacity**: Control 6 wings simultaneously
- **Special Features**: Automatic weather updates, enemy position reports

**Long-Range Communication System** (Rare Module):
- **Control Range**: 200km radius - strategic operations capability
- **Enhanced Features**: Coordinate with other carriers, relay intelligence
- **Aircraft Capacity**: Control 8 wings, coordinate multi-carrier operations

---

### Out-of-Range Operations

**Autonomous Behavior Programming**:
- **Last Order Continuation**: Aircraft continue last received command
- **Combat Protocols**: Engage targets of opportunity within mission parameters
- **Return Protocols**: Automatic return when fuel reaches 25% capacity
- **Emergency Procedures**: Return immediately if heavily damaged

**Strategic Risk/Reward**:

Pushing aircraft to maximum range yields better targets but risks losing valuable squadrons and experienced crew if communication is severed.

---

## Landing Operations - Deck Management Crisis

### Deck State Conflicts

**Critical Decision Points**:
- **Returning Aircraft vs. Ready Strikes**: Cancel prepared launch or force aircraft to wait?
- **Emergency Landing vs. Scheduled Recovery**: Damaged aircraft override normal procedures?
- **Fuel Crisis Management**: Multiple wings returning with low fuel simultaneously

#### **Resource Competition Example: USS Lexington**

USS Lexington has 2 wings ready to launch major strike while 3 damaged wings return with minimal fuel. Player must choose:
- **Option A**: Launch strike and risk losing returning aircraft
- **Option B**: Abort mission to save experienced crews

---

### Landing Queue Priority System

**Priority Levels**:
1. **Emergency Fuel** (<10% remaining): Immediate landing clearance
2. **Battle Damage**: Structural damage requiring immediate attention
3. **Mission Critical**: High-value intelligence or captured enemy pilot
4. **Standard Recovery**: Normal mission completion landing

#### **Fuel Management Drama**

Wing 3 (Torpedo bombers) circles carrier with 5% fuel while Wing 1 (Fighters) clears deck after emergency landing. Wing 5 (Dive bombers) also returning with 8% fuel. Player must rapidly coordinate deck operations to prevent loss of 30+ aircraft and crew.

---

## Resource Management - Operational Sustainability

### Aviation Fuel Economics

**Consumption Rates by Mission Type**:
- **Combat Air Patrol**: 2 fuel units per hour - defensive operations
- **Reconnaissance**: 3 fuel units per hour - extended search patterns
- **Strike Missions**: 4-6 fuel units per hour - high-performance combat operations
- **Extended Range**: 8+ fuel units per hour - maximum range operations

**Fuel Planning Example**:

HMS Ark Royal (500 fuel units) plans 8-hour patrol mission with 4 wings:
- **Conservative estimate**: 4 wings × 8 hours × 3 units = 96 fuel units for routine patrol
- **Combat operations**: 200+ fuel units for high-intensity operations
- **Reserve requirement**: Maintain 25% fuel reserve for emergencies

---

### Ammunition Expenditure & Resupply

**Combat Consumption Rates**:
- **Fighter Engagement**: 50-200 rounds per combat, depending on pilot skill and enemy resistance
- **Bombing Missions**: 100% ordnance expended per mission (single-use bombs/torpedoes)
- **Strafing Runs**: 100-500 rounds per attack depending on target type

**Resupply Challenges**:
- **Port-Based Resupply**: Full ammunition available at friendly major ports
- **At-Sea Resupply**: Supply ships can transfer basic ammunition only
- **Captured Munitions**: Enemy ammunition requires modification, reduced effectiveness
- **Emergency Operations**: Must return to port when ammunition depleted

---

### Maintenance & Aircraft Attrition

**Maintenance Requirements**:
- **Routine Maintenance**: 1 maintenance unit per 10 flight hours
- **Combat Damage**: 2-5 maintenance units per damaged aircraft
- **Engine Overhaul**: 10 maintenance units per 100 flight hours
- **Emergency Repairs**: Field repairs possible but reduce aircraft performance

**Aircraft Loss Factors**:
- **Combat Losses**: Shot down by enemy fighters or AA fire (permanent loss)
- **Operational Losses**: Engine failure, weather, navigation errors (10-15% of total losses)
- **Landing Accidents**: Deck crashes, especially in rough weather (aircraft repairable but crew at risk)

---

### Aircraft Replacement System

**Spare Aircraft in Cargo Inventory**:
Carriers can store **spare aircraft** in cargo inventory (tetris grid) to replace losses in active wings:
- **F6F Hellcat**: 2x3 inventory spaces - Can carry spares for fighter wing replacements
- **SBD Dauntless**: 2x4 inventory spaces - Can carry spares for dive bomber wing replacements
- **TBF Avenger**: 3x4 inventory spaces - Can carry spares for torpedo bomber wing replacements

**Replacement Mechanics**:

**Individual Aircraft Losses** (Wing Partially Destroyed):
- Wing loses aircraft during combat/operations
- **Example**: Wing 1 starts with 12 F6F Hellcats, loses 4 in combat, returns with 8
- Upon return to carrier, player can assign spare F6F Hellcats from inventory to restore wing to 12 aircraft
- **Limitation**: Can only replace if spare aircraft available in cargo inventory
- **Cost**: No credit cost for replacement, just inventory management
- **Time**: Requires preparation time based on crew stats before wing can launch again

**Complete Wing Destruction** (All Aircraft Lost):
- Entire wing eliminated in combat (all 12 aircraft shot down)
- **Crew Card Returns**: The aviation crew card assigned to that wing **automatically returns to player inventory**
- Wing slot becomes **empty** and inactive
- **To Rebuild Wing**:
  1. Must have sufficient replacement aircraft in cargo inventory (e.g., 12x F6F Hellcat)
  2. Assign replacement aircraft from cargo to empty wing slot
  3. Re-assign aviation crew card to rebuilt wing
  4. Wing becomes operational again after preparation time

**Strategic Implications**:
- **Cargo Space Trade-Off**: Carrying spare aircraft reduces cargo space for fuel, ammunition, or valuable loot
- **Risk Management**: More spares = safer operations but less profitable (reduced cargo capacity)
- **Attrition Planning**: Long deployments require spare aircraft planning
- **Wing Loss**: Losing entire wing is recoverable IF you have spares, but losing crew card (permadeath T6+) is catastrophic

**Example Replacement Scenario (USS Essex)**:

**Before Combat**:
- Wing 1: 12 F6F Hellcats (Fighter Pilot crew card Level 75)
- Cargo Inventory: 6 spare F6F Hellcats (36 grid cells), 4 spare SBD Dauntless (32 grid cells)

**After Combat**:
- Wing 1: 5 F6F Hellcats return (7 lost in combat)
- **Action**: Assign 7 spare F6F Hellcats from cargo inventory to Wing 1
- **Result**: Wing 1 restored to 12 F6F Hellcats, crew card remains assigned, ready for next sortie
- **Remaining Cargo**: 0 spare F6F Hellcats, 4 spare SBD Dauntless (running low on fighter replacements)

**Complete Wing Loss Example**:
- Wing 3: All 12 SBD Dauntless destroyed
- **Automatic**: Bomber Pilot crew card (Level 90) returns to player inventory (safe)
- **To Rebuild**: Assign 12 spare SBD Dauntless from cargo + re-assign crew card
- **If No Spares**: Wing 3 remains empty until return to port for resupply

## Crew & Equipment Dependencies - Human Factors

### Crew Stats Impact on Operations (7-50 Stat System)

**Preparation Speed by Crew Stats** (Engineer Repair Speed stat 7-50):
- **Legendary Crew (Repair Speed stat 50)**: 40% of base preparation time, +105% aircraft performance
- **Expert Crew (Repair Speed stat 35)**: 60% of base preparation time, +60% aircraft performance
- **Baseline Crew (Repair Speed stat 15)**: 100% of base preparation time, standard performance
- **Rookie Crew (Repair Speed stat 7)**: 125% of base preparation time, -25% aircraft performance

**Crew Specialization Benefits**:
- **Fighter Specialists** (Fighter Pilot Dogfighting stat 7-50): +0% air-to-air at stat 15 (baseline), up to +97% at stat 50 (legendary)
- **Bomber Specialists** (Bomber Pilot Accuracy stat 7-50): +0% bombing accuracy at stat 15 (baseline), up to +97% at stat 50 (legendary)
- **All-Around Crew**: Balanced performance across all mission types (moderate stats in all classifications)

### Advanced Equipment Integration

**Communication Range Modules**:
- **Basic Radio**: 50km control radius, adequate for coastal operations
- **Long-Range Communications**: 100km radius, enables deep-ocean operations
- **Fleet Command Suite**: 200km radius, coordinate multiple carrier operations

#### **Strategic Equipment Example**

USS Enterprise with Long-Range Communications can coordinate with USS Hornet 150km away, launching simultaneous strikes from different vectors against Japanese fleet, overwhelming enemy defenses through superior coordination.

## Carrier Vulnerability & Risk Management

### Tier-Based Risk Scaling

**Carrier Value = Massive Target**:
- **T1-T4 Carriers**: Moderate threat level, full ship recovery on death, 100% cargo loss
- **T5 Carriers**: High-value target, sailor casualties but 0% permadeath, last completely safe tier, 100% cargo loss
- **T6-T9 Carriers**: 10-60% ship/crew card permadeath risk, hunted aggressively by players, 100% cargo loss
- **T10 Carriers**: 100% PERMADEATH (ship + all crew cards + cargo), server-wide alerts when detected
- **ALL Tiers**: 100% cargo loss on death (aircraft, aviation fuel, ordnance, maintenance supplies) per [[Inventory-System]]

**Visibility and Detection**:
- High-tier carriers attract attention across vast distances (100-200km+ detection range)
- T9-T10 carriers create server-wide awareness due to their strategic importance
- Operating high-tier carriers in any waters creates massive risk due to their visibility
- **Risk Management**: High-tier carriers always face extreme attention regardless of location

### High-Stakes Extraction Scenarios

**Carrier Vulnerability Phases** (applies to all tiers):
1. **Launch Phase**: Stationary target during aircraft launch operations
2. **Recovery Phase**: Predictable course and speed during landing operations
3. **Refueling Phase**: Vulnerable to submarine attack during support ship rendezvous

#### **Example Crisis: USS Wasp Under Submarine Threat**

USS Wasp launching strike against Japanese convoy when German U-boat detected at 8km range. Player must choose:
- **Option A**: Complete aircraft launch (5 minutes vulnerability)
- **Option B**: Emergency course change (aborting mission, losing prepared strike)

Torpedo track detected - 60 seconds to impact. Emergency dive course saves carrier but 2 aircraft crash during aborted landing.

---

### Multi-Domain Threat Response

**Threat Integration Management**:
- **Surface Threats**: Enemy destroyers approaching at high speed - aircraft can attack but carrier must maintain distance
- **Submarine Threats**: Underwater contacts requiring immediate course changes - disrupts flight operations
- **Air Threats**: Enemy bombers approaching - must launch fighters while protecting recovery operations

#### **Complex Tactical Scenario: HMS Illustrious Under Simultaneous Threats**

HMS Illustrious (T5 Fleet Carrier) operating 90km off Norway faces simultaneous threats:
- **German surface ships** approaching from east
- **U-boat contact** to south
- **Ju-88 bombers** inbound from north
- **2 wings returning** low on fuel

**Required Coordination**:
1. Fighters to intercept bombers
2. Course change to avoid submarine
3. Maintain sufficient distance from surface ships
4. Manage fuel crisis for returning aircraft
