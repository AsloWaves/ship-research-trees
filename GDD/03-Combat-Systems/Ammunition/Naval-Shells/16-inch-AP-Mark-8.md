## Historical Background

The Mark 8 "super-heavy" armor-piercing shell was developed specifically for the 16"/50 Mark 7 guns of the Iowa class. At 2,700 pounds, it was the heaviest 16" AP shell ever fired by the US Navy, designed to maximize penetration against the latest Japanese battleship armor.

The "super-heavy" concept traded muzzle velocity for shell mass, resulting in better penetration at typical combat ranges (15,000-25,000 yards) where the heavier shell retained more energy. The design was particularly effective against the deck armor that shells would encounter at longer ranges due to their plunging trajectory.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for game balance*

- **Role**: Primary anti-capital ship ammunition
- **Strengths**: Highest penetration of any 16" shell, excellent at range
- **Weaknesses**: Slow shell (slight lead required), heavy so fewer carried
- **Historical Accuracy**: Very high - represents peak US battleship firepower
- **Best Targets**: Enemy battleships at 15-25km range

### Tactical Usage

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Broadside battleship | Fire AP - citadel opportunity |
| Angled battleship | Consider HE or wait for better angle |
| Heavy cruiser | AP overkill but effective |
| Destroyer | Overpenetration - use HE |

## Storage & Logistics

### Magazine Capacity (Iowa Class)

| Location | Shells | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Forward magazines | ~400 | Turrets 1 & 2 |
| Aft magazines | ~200 | Turret 3 |
| **Total AP** | ~600 | Standard loadout |

### Cost & Availability

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Credits** | 850 per shell |
| **Production** | US Navy yards only |
| **Availability** | Abundant (Allied) |
