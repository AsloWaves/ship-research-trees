USA NAVAL TURRETS CANVAS SPLIT - COMPLETION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Date: 2025-11-11
Task: Split USA naval gun turrets from Naval-Weapons Tree.canvas into a
      separate canvas file while maintaining exact layout and edges.

================================================================================
FILES CREATED/MODIFIED
================================================================================

1. NEW FILE: C:\Research\Weapons\Naval-Weapons\Naval-Guns\Turrets\USA-Naval-Turrets-Tree.canvas
   - Contains: 1,700 turret nodes + 1 group node + 289 edges
   - Layout: Exact original positions preserved
   - Properties: All node IDs, colors, dimensions, and edge properties maintained

2. UPDATED FILE: C:\Research\Weapons\Naval-Weapons\Naval-Weapons Tree.canvas
   - Remaining: 987 weapon nodes + 5 group nodes + 0 edges
   - Groups adjusted to start from top:
     * Bombs: Y = 0
     * Missiles: Y = 680
     * Torpedoes: Y = 1,360
     * Naval-Guns-Ammunition: Y = 2,040
     * Naval-Guns-Guns: Y = 2,720

================================================================================
VERIFICATION RESULTS
================================================================================

USA-Naval-Turrets-Tree.canvas:
  ✓ Total nodes: 1,701 (1 group + 1,700 turrets)
  ✓ Total edges: 289 (all turret-to-turret connections)
  ✓ All nodes contain 'Naval-Guns/Turrets/USA' in file path
  ✓ Group: "Naval-Guns-Turrets (USA Research Tree)"
  ✓ Group dimensions: 9,300 x 22,400 pixels
  ✓ Edge properties preserved: id, color, fromNode, toNode, fromSide, toSide
  ✓ Node properties preserved: id, type, file, x, y, width, height, color

Naval-Weapons Tree.canvas:
  ✓ Total nodes: 992 (5 groups + 987 weapons)
  ✓ Total edges: 0 (turret edges successfully removed)
  ✓ Zero turret nodes remaining (complete separation)
  ✓ Groups present: Bombs, Missiles, Torpedoes, Naval-Guns-Ammunition, Naval-Guns-Guns
  ✓ All groups repositioned starting from Y=0 with 680px spacing
  ✓ All child nodes within groups adjusted accordingly

TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Original Canvas:
  - Total nodes: 2,693
  - Total edges: 289
  - File size: ~577 KB

After Split:
  - Turrets Canvas: 1,701 nodes + 289 edges
  - Weapons Canvas: 992 nodes + 0 edges

Split Logic:
  - Identified turret nodes by file path pattern: "Naval-Guns/Turrets/USA"
  - Identified turret group by label pattern: "Turrets"
  - Filtered edges by checking if both endpoints are turret nodes
  - Preserved all original node IDs to maintain edge references
  - Adjusted group Y positions and recalculated child node positions

Edge Distribution:
  - All 289 edges were turret-to-turret connections
  - Other weapon types (Bombs, Missiles, Torpedoes, Ammunition, Guns) had no edges
  - This confirms turrets form a connected research tree

================================================================================
FILE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Both canvas files use standard Obsidian Canvas JSON format:
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "type": "file" | "group",
      "file": "path/to/file.md",  // for file nodes
      "label": "Group Name",      // for group nodes
      "x": number,
      "y": number,
      "width": number,
      "height": number,
      "color": "string"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "fromNode": "node_id",
      "toNode": "node_id",
      "fromSide": "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right",
      "toSide": "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right",
      "color": "string"
    }
  ]
}

================================================================================
VALIDATION STATUS
================================================================================

✓ Both files are valid JSON
✓ Both files can be loaded by Obsidian Canvas
✓ All turret nodes successfully extracted
✓ No turret nodes remain in Naval-Weapons canvas
✓ All 289 edges preserved in turrets canvas
✓ Group positions successfully adjusted
✓ File paths preserved exactly as original
✓ Node IDs preserved for edge integrity
✓ Colors and dimensions preserved

OVERALL STATUS: SUCCESS

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Both canvas files are ready to use in Obsidian:

1. Open USA-Naval-Turrets-Tree.canvas to view the complete USA naval gun
   turrets research tree with all 1,700 turrets and their progression edges.

2. Open Naval-Weapons Tree.canvas to view the reorganized weapons overview
   with Bombs, Missiles, Torpedoes, Ammunition, and Guns (without turrets).

3. The original layout has been preserved in the turrets canvas, so all
   visual relationships and progression paths remain intact.
