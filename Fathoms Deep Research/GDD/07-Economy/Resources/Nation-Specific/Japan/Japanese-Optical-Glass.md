## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Premium optical glass from Japanese manufacturers renowned for exceptional clarity. Highly sought for rangefinders, periscopes, and night optics critical to Japanese naval doctrine.

---

## Lore

Japanese optical glass manufacturing achieved world-class quality by the 1930s, rivaling German Zeiss products. The Imperial Japanese Navy's emphasis on night combat and long-range engagement drove demand for superior optical components. Japanese manufacturers like Nippon Kogaku (later Nikon) produced exceptional glass with minimal distortion and superior light transmission. This optical superiority gave Japanese ships an edge in night surface actions and long-range fire control. The glass's quality made it valuable beyond military applications - captured Japanese optics were prized by Allied forces for reverse-engineering and direct use. Supply disruption from strategic bombing made Japanese optical glass increasingly scarce as the war progressed.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Japanese warship optics | Hard | 2-5 units |
| Purchase | Japanese-controlled ports | N/A | Limited availability |
| Capture | Japanese industrial facilities | Very Hard | 5-10 units |
| Looting | Damaged optical workshops | Medium | 3-7 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for high-quality rangefinders, premium periscopes, advanced night optics, precision binoculars
- **Construction**: IJN fire control systems, submarine periscope assemblies, night combat equipment
- **Consumable**: Not consumed directly
- **Trade**: High value in black markets, Allied intelligence seeks samples, premium in optical manufacturing

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Japanese Optical Glass x3, Precision Machinery x1 | Fabrication | Premium Rangefinder | Optical Workshop |
| Japanese Optical Glass x2, Metal Housing x1 | Assembly | Advanced Binoculars | Precision Facility |
| Raw Materials x5, Japanese Expertise | Manufacturing | Japanese Optical Glass x2 | Japanese Industrial Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~412 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Pacific theater -10%, Allied markets +80%, late-war +150% (scarcity) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Japan (Nippon Kogaku, other specialized manufacturers)
- **Major Consumers**: Imperial Japanese Navy, optical equipment manufacturers, Allied reverse-engineering programs
- **Bottlenecks**: Specialized manufacturing expertise, strategic bombing damage, raw material shortages

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Japanese optical glass provides measurable combat advantages in fire control precision and night vision capability. The superior clarity translates directly to improved ranging accuracy at extreme distances. For Japanese players, domestic optical glass enables their doctrine of superior optics compensating for numerical inferiority. Allied players prize captured Japanese glass for upgrading their own optical systems or reverse-engineering manufacturing techniques. As war progresses and Japanese production capacity declines, optical glass becomes increasingly valuable, with late-war scarcity driving prices to premium levels.
