## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

British Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee equipment - revolutionary underwater acoustic detection system. Essential for hunting U-boats and providing British escorts with submarine detection capability.

---

## Lore

ASDIC (later called sonar) represents Britain's technological edge in the Battle of the Atlantic. These sophisticated underwater detection systems use sound pulses to locate submerged U-boats, turning the submarine from invisible hunter into detectable prey. British anti-submarine escorts equipped with ASDIC can track, close, and destroy submarines that would otherwise slip past convoys undetected. The Royal Navy guards ASDIC technology zealously - recovery operations for damaged escorts prioritize ASDIC equipment retrieval to prevent German capture and reverse-engineering. Allied nations desperately seek ASDIC units through Lend-Lease programs. Axis intelligence services offer enormous bounties for intact ASDIC equipment, making them prime targets for espionage and salvage operations.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | British escort vessel wrecks | Very Hard | 1 unit |
| Purchase | UK ports (restricted) | N/A | Requires clearance |
| Lend-Lease | Allied cooperation missions | Hard | 1 unit |
| Espionage | Intelligence operations | Extreme | 1 unit (high bounty) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for anti-submarine systems, integrated sonar suites, submarine detection equipment
- **Construction**: Essential for escort vessels, submarine hunters, convoy protection ships
- **Consumable**: Not consumed directly, but provides submarine detection capability when installed
- **Trade**: Heavily restricted by UK government, black market extreme value, Allied nations pay premiums

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| ASDIC Equipment x1, Advanced Electronics x2 | Installation | Anti-Submarine System | Naval Shipyard |
| Damaged ASDIC x1, Precision Parts x2 | Rebuild | ASDIC Equipment x1 | British Naval Facility |
| ASDIC Equipment x1 | Intelligence Sale | 20,000+ credits | Axis Intelligence Broker |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3375 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | Atlantic theater +100%, Axis markets +300%, Pacific theater +150% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United Kingdom (exclusive), limited US license production
- **Major Consumers**: Royal Navy escorts, Allied anti-submarine forces, intelligence services
- **Bottlenecks**: Classified technology restrictions, specialized manufacturing, security clearances

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

ASDIC equipment is game-changing for anti-submarine warfare. Before ASDIC, submarines attacked with near impunity. After ASDIC, convoy escorts can detect, track, and destroy submarines before they reach attack positions. This single technology shifted the Battle of the Atlantic from Axis advantage to Allied control. Players with ASDIC-equipped vessels dominate submarine-heavy theaters. The technology is so valuable that some missions focus entirely on ASDIC recovery or sabotage. Nations lacking ASDIC suffer significantly higher convoy losses, making it a strategic necessity for any serious naval power.
