## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

World-renowned German precision optics from Carl Zeiss AG. Represents the gold standard for rangefinders, periscopes, and fire control instruments.

---

## Lore

Carl Zeiss represents the pinnacle of optical engineering excellence. For decades before WW2, Zeiss optics set the world standard for precision, clarity, and reliability. The Kriegsmarine equipped its entire fleet with Zeiss rangefinders, periscopes, and binoculars, giving German crews unmatched target acquisition capability. U-boat periscopes with Zeiss optics could identify targets at extreme ranges, critical for approach calculations. Surface vessels used Zeiss fire control optics to achieve first-salvo accuracy that often decided engagements. Allied navies coveted captured Zeiss equipment, immediately installing it on their own vessels or shipping it home for analysis. The Zeiss factory in Jena became a strategic bombing target specifically to disrupt optical production. Post-battle salvage operations prioritize Zeiss optics recovery - even damaged units can be refurbished for premium resale.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Kriegsmarine vessel wrecks | Very Hard | 1-3 units |
| Purchase | German-controlled ports | N/A | Highly restricted |
| Capture | German naval facilities | Extreme | 2-5 units |
| Intelligence Operation | High-priority targets | Very Hard | 1 unit (pristine condition) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for premium rangefinders, elite periscopes, advanced fire control systems, precision binoculars
- **Construction**: High-end fire control installations, submarine periscope upgrades, elite officer equipment
- **Consumable**: Not consumed directly; provides accuracy bonuses when equipped
- **Trade**: Extreme value across all factions, intelligence services pay premiums, black market thrives

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Zeiss Optics x2, Precision Machinery x1 | Assembly | Elite Rangefinder | Advanced Optical Workshop |
| Zeiss Optics x1, Submarine Components x1 | Integration | Premium Periscope | Naval Shipyard |
| Damaged Zeiss x1, Optical Glass x2 | Restoration | Zeiss Optics x1 | Specialized Optical Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2750 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | Allied markets +250%, neutral ports +150%, late-war +300% (factory bombing disruption) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Carl Zeiss AG - Jena), no license production
- **Major Consumers**: Kriegsmarine, Luftwaffe, Allied intelligence/reverse-engineering, global naval forces
- **Bottlenecks**: Single production source vulnerability, strategic bombing, export restrictions

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Zeiss optics provide tangible combat superiority through improved accuracy and target acquisition. Ships equipped with Zeiss rangefinders gain first-shot accuracy bonuses that can decide engagements before enemies achieve ranging solutions. U-boats with Zeiss periscopes identify targets faster and more reliably, critical for attack positioning. The scarcity creates fierce competition - captured Zeiss equipment often goes straight to flagship vessels or elite commanders. Some players specialize in Zeiss acquisition and resale, building entire economic strategies around this premium commodity. The reputation is well-earned: properly equipped Zeiss optics measurably improve player performance in long-range gunnery and submarine operations.
