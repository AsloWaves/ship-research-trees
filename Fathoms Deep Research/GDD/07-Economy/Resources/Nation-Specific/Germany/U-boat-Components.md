## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision-engineered components for German submarine construction. High-pressure hull segments, diesel-electric drive systems, and specialized diving equipment manufactured to exacting Kriegsmarine standards.

---

## Lore

Germany's U-boat fleet represents the pinnacle of submarine warfare engineering. These specialized components—from pressure-resistant hull sections to sophisticated periscope assemblies and silent-running machinery—are manufactured in heavily guarded facilities across the Reich. The Kriegsmarine's dominance in underwater warfare stems from decades of innovation, with German engineers perfecting diesel-electric propulsion systems, advanced torpedo tubes, and deep-diving capabilities that far exceed Allied designs. Each component meets rigorous quality standards; a single flawed weld or miscalibrated valve could doom an entire crew to a crushing depth. The British Royal Navy has standing orders to capture any U-boat components intact, as reverse-engineering German submarine technology remains a top intelligence priority.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Military Contract | German Naval Yards | High | 1-2 units |
| Convoy Raid | Baltic Shipping Lanes | Very High | 1-3 units |
| Black Market | Neutral Ports | Extreme | 1 unit |
| Salvage | Captured U-boats | Extreme | 2-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: U-boat construction and repair modules, submarine retrofit packages, advanced torpedo systems
- **Construction**: Type VII U-boats, Type IX U-boats, Type XXI submarines, submarine pens, underwater detection systems
- **Consumable**: Emergency repair kits for damaged submarines (+25% diving depth restoration)
- **Trade**: Extremely high demand from Axis navies, forbidden in Allied ports (contraband), moderate black market demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Krupp Steel x3, Advanced Electronics x2 | Precision Manufacturing | U-boat Components x1 | Kriegsmarine Shipyard |
| U-boat Components x1, Optical Glass x1 | Periscope Assembly | Advanced Periscope System | Specialist Workshop |
| U-boat Components x2, Diesel Fuel x5 | Propulsion Integration | Silent-Running Engine | U-boat Pen |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3750 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | German ports: 3500-4000cr, Neutral ports: 5000-7000cr, Allied ports: Illegal (confiscation) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Kiel, Hamburg, Bremen shipyards), limited production in occupied territories
- **Major Consumers**: Kriegsmarine submarine fleet, Axis submarine programs (Italy, Japan tech exchange)
- **Bottlenecks**: Allied bombing raids on manufacturing facilities, shortage of skilled labor, raw material embargoes

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Germany's submarine warfare doctrine depends entirely on maintaining a fleet of operational U-boats. These components represent the technological edge that allows wolfpack tactics to strangle Allied supply lines across the Atlantic. Loss of production facilities directly impacts Germany's ability to project naval power, making these components among the most strategically critical resources in the European theater. Allied navies expend enormous resources hunting U-boats precisely because each submarine represents hundreds of man-hours and irreplaceable specialized components.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Illegal | N/A | Contraband - immediate confiscation and investigation |
| United Kingdom | Illegal | N/A | War material - seized on sight, intelligence priority |
| Japan | Very Rare | +150% | Limited tech exchange program, difficult transport |
| Germany | Common | Base | Standard military procurement through Kriegsmarine |
