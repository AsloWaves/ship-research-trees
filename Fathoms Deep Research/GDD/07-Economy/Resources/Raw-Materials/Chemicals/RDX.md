## Description

> *Research Department Explosive - 50% more powerful than TNT. The cutting edge of military explosive technology.*

---

## Lore

RDX represents the apex of explosive chemistry. This white crystalline compound delivers fifty percent more destructive power than TNT, pound for pound. When you need to punch through armored hulls or sink submarines with fewer depth charges, RDX is the answer.

The manufacturing process is complex and expensive, requiring hexamine and nitric acid in carefully controlled reactions. Only the most advanced chemical plants can produce it reliably. Those who have it use it sparingly, reserving RDX for the most critical applications where maximum destructive power matters.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Advanced chemical plants | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major naval bases | Hard | Premium price |
| Capture | Enemy high-value munitions | Very Hard | 3-8 units |
| Research | Explosives research | Hard | Unlocks production |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Torpex, enhanced warheads, shaped charges
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High demand from advanced munitions producers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Nitric Acid ×4 + Hexamine ×2 | Advanced Nitration | RDX ×2 | Advanced Chemical Plant |
| TNT ×2 + RDX ×1 + Aluminum ×1 | Mixing | Torpex ×2 | Advanced Explosives |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~43 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at advanced plants, +60% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Advanced chemical plants (limited)
- **Major Consumers**: High-performance munitions production
- **Bottlenecks**: Complex manufacturing, precursor availability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Premium explosive power
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

RDX availability determines access to premium munitions. Nations with RDX production can field more effective torpedoes, depth charges, and bombs. Those without make do with TNT - adequate, but not optimal.
