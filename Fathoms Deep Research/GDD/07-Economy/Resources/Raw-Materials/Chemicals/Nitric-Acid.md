## Description

> *Powerful corrosive acid essential for explosives manufacturing. Handle with extreme care - this is the stuff that makes TNT.*

## Lore

Nitric acid is violence in liquid form. Mix it with the right organic compounds and you get TNT. Mix it with glycerin and you get nitroglycerin. Mix it with cellulose and you get guncotton. Nearly every modern explosive owes its existence to nitric acid.

The fuming yellow liquid eats through most materials and releases choking vapors. Workers in nitric acid plants wear protective gear and pray nothing goes wrong. One spill, one cracked container, and the acid begins consuming everything it touches. But without it, the explosives production line stops cold.
