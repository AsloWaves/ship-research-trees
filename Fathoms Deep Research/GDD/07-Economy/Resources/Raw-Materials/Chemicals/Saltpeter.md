## Description

> *Potassium nitrate - the oxidizer that makes propellants burn. No saltpeter, no gunpowder, no firing.*

---

## Lore

Saltpeter is the breath of fire. Without it, gunpowder won't burn - it provides the oxygen that lets propellants ignite even in sealed shell casings. Every round fired depends on saltpeter to deliver its punch.

The saltpeter trade once determined the fate of empires. Now synthetic production supplements natural deposits, but the demand remains insatiable. Ammunition factories consume saltpeter by the ton, converting it into the propellant charges that hurl shells across miles of ocean.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Natural deposits | Easy | 15-30 units |
| Production | Chemical plants | Medium | 10 per batch |
| Purchase | Any port | Easy | Very cheap |
| Salvage | Ammunition stores | Easy | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Gunpowder, propellants, nitric acid
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High volume industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Sulfur ×2 + Saltpeter ×2 + Charcoal ×1 | Mixing | Gunpowder ×3 | Powder Works |
| Saltpeter ×3 + Sulfuric Acid ×2 | Reaction | Nitric Acid ×2 | Chemical Plant |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at chemical plants, +15% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Chemical plants, natural deposits
- **Major Consumers**: Ammunition factories, propellant production
- **Bottlenecks**: Rarely constrained - synthetic production fills gaps

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential but producible
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Saltpeter's strategic value lies in its role as feedstock. Cutting off saltpeter eventually halts ammunition production, but synthetic alternatives and stockpiles provide substantial buffer time.
