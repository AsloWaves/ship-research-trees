## Description

> *Toxic chemical weapon - RESTRICTED. Possession requires special authorization. The ghost of the Great War.*

---

## Lore

Chlorine gas is a war crime waiting to happen. The pale green poison that choked trenches in the Great War remains technically available, though international law forbids its use. Every nation maintains small stockpiles - officially for "industrial purposes" or "defensive research."

The truth is darker. Some commanders keep chlorine reserves as a weapon of last resort or deterrence. Others use it in black operations that never appear in official records. Possession is legal; deployment is not. The line between the two grows thin when defeat looms.

**WARNING**: Use of chemical weapons may result in severe diplomatic consequences, faction standing penalties, and retaliation.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Chemical plants (restricted) | Very Hard | 1 per batch |
| Black Market | Criminal contacts | Very Hard | Extremely expensive |
| Capture | Enemy research facilities | Very Hard | 1-3 units |
| Research | Chemical weapons program | Very Hard | Unlocks production |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Chemical weapons (restricted), industrial processes
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ⚠️ Weapon deployment (severe consequences)
- **Trade**: Illegal on open markets

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Salt ×3 + Electricity | Electrolysis | Chlorine ×1 | Chemical Plant |
| Chlorine ×1 + Delivery System ×1 | Weaponization | Chemical Shell ×1 | Restricted Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1200 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | N/A - Black market only |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Classified research facilities
- **Major Consumers**: Chemical weapons programs (restricted)
- **Bottlenecks**: International law, moral constraints

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Devastating but forbidden
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (1/5) - No legitimate market
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Chlorine represents the dark side of chemistry. Its effectiveness is undeniable; its use is unforgivable. Smart commanders never use it. Desperate ones sometimes do.
