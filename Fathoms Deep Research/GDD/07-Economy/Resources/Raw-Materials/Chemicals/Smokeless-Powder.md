## Description

> *Modern propellant that burns without smoke. The American standard for all naval gun ammunition.*

---

## Lore

Smokeless powder revolutionized naval gunnery. The old black powder created billowing clouds that blinded gunners and revealed positions. Smokeless powder burns clean, letting crews maintain visual contact with targets while keeping their own position ambiguous.

American and German navies prefer smokeless powder formulations over British cordite. The compounds differ slightly but serve the same purpose - generating the massive pressures needed to hurl shells at distant targets. Either works; preference is largely a matter of industrial tradition.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at propellant plants, +15% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Propellant factories (US, Germany primary)
- **Major Consumers**: All ammunition production
- **Bottlenecks**: Nitrocellulose production capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for all firing
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Smokeless powder is effectively interchangeable with cordite for game purposes. Both serve as the propellant that makes ammunition work. Running out of either silences the guns.
