## Description

> *Sweet, thick liquid that becomes nitroglycerin when treated with acids. Essential for dynamite and cordite production.*

---

## Lore

Glycerin seems harmless - a thick, sweet liquid used in soaps and medicines. But add nitric acid and it transforms into nitroglycerin, one of the most powerful explosives known. Every stick of dynamite, every cordite propellant charge traces its lineage back to glycerin.

The irony isn't lost on ammunition workers that the same substance soothing chapped lips becomes the heart of explosive death. Soap factories and munitions plants compete for the same glycerin supply. In wartime, vanity takes a back seat to firepower.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Soap factories | Medium | 5 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Byproduct | Fat rendering | Easy | 2-4 units |
| Trade | Chemical suppliers | Easy | Steady availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Nitroglycerin, dynamite, cordite, smokeless powder
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: Medical supplies (minor)
- **Trade**: Steady demand from explosives manufacturers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Fats ×3 + Lye ×1 | Saponification | Glycerin ×2 + Soap ×3 | Soap Factory |
| Glycerin ×1 + Nitric Acid ×2 | Nitration | Nitroglycerin ×1 | Chemical Plant |
| Glycerin ×2 + Nitric Acid ×2 + Cellulose ×1 | Processing | Cordite ×3 | Propellant Factory |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~9 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% near soap factories, +25% at explosives plants |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Soap factories, fat rendering plants
- **Major Consumers**: Explosives manufacturers, propellant factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Competition with civilian soap production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Critical for propellants
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Glycerin bridges civilian and military production. Controlling glycerin means controlling both soap supply and explosive potential. Smart nations stockpile glycerin before war, knowing soap can wait but shells cannot.
