## Description

> *Dual-purpose oxidizer used for both explosives and fertilizer. A wartime staple that feeds crops and fuels bombs.*

---

## Lore

Ammonium nitrate straddles the line between creation and destruction. In peacetime, it grows crops that feed nations. In wartime, it fills bombs that destroy them. The same white prills that farmers spread on fields end up packed into shell casings.

The chemistry is simple - ammonium nitrate provides oxygen for combustion, just like saltpeter. Mix it with fuel oil and you have ANFO, a cheap but effective explosive. Mix it with soil and you have fertilizer. Context determines whether it builds or breaks.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Chemical plants | Easy | 10 per batch |
| Purchase | Any port | Easy | Very cheap |
| Salvage | Agricultural areas | Easy | 15-30 units |
| Trade | Fertilizer suppliers | Easy | Bulk quantities |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: ANFO explosives, blasting compounds
- **Construction**: Mining/demolition applications
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Universal demand (civilian and military)

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at chemical plants, +10% in remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Chemical plants worldwide
- **Major Consumers**: Agriculture, mining, military
- **Bottlenecks**: Ammonia production capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Bulk explosive alternative
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Agricultural essential
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Ammonium nitrate is the poor man's explosive - cheap, abundant, and effective enough for mining and construction. Military use is secondary to more sophisticated compounds, but it fills gaps when premium explosives run short.
