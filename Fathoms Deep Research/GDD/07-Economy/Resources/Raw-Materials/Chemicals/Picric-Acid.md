## Description

> *Early high explosive still used in older shell designs. More powerful than TNT but corrosive and temperamental.*

---

## Lore

Picric acid was the first high explosive to see widespread military use. Bright yellow crystals packed more punch than TNT, but the compound had dangerous quirks. It reacts with metals to form sensitive salts that can detonate unexpectedly. Old shells filled with picric acid are ticking time bombs.

Some navies still use picric acid derivatives in their older ammunition. Japan's shimose explosive is picric acid based, as was Britain's lyddite. The economics sometimes favor using existing stockpiles rather than replacing perfectly good shells with newer designs.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Chemical plants | Medium | 3 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Medium | Standard price |
| Salvage | Older ammunition stores | Medium | 5-12 units |
| Capture | Enemy legacy munitions | Medium | 8-20 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Older shell designs, lyddite/shimose ammunition
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Moderate demand for legacy ammunition

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Phenol ×2 + Nitric Acid ×3 | Nitration | Picric Acid ×2 | Chemical Plant |
| Picric Acid ×2 + Shell Casing ×1 | Assembly | Legacy Shell ×1 | Ammunition Factory |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~40 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at chemical plants, +25% in Asian markets |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Chemical plants with nitration capability
- **Major Consumers**: Legacy ammunition production
- **Bottlenecks**: Phenol supply, safety concerns

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Effective but outdated
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Picric acid remains relevant where older equipment and ammunition designs are still in service. It's not the best explosive available, but it works, and sometimes using what you have beats waiting for what you want.
