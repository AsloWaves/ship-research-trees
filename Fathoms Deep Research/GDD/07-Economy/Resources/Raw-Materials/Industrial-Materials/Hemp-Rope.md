## Description

> *Traditional fiber rope for mooring, rigging, and general shipboard use. Strong and reliable, though susceptible to rot.*

## Lore

Hemp rope is the traditional cordage of navies. Strong, flexible, and readily available, it's been lashing ships to piers and securing cargo for centuries. Every sailor knows how to handle hemp - splicing, knotting, and coiling are basic seamanship.

The disadvantage is rot. Hemp absorbs water and eventually degrades, requiring regular replacement. Modern navies supplement hemp with wire and synthetic alternatives, but traditional rope still has its place for applications where flexibility matters more than permanence.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at production centers, +15% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Temperate regions with hemp cultivation
- **Major Consumers**: All maritime operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Agricultural production cycles

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Essential but replaceable
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Hemp rope is a maintenance material. Ships consume it steadily as old rope wears out and gets replaced. Adequate supply keeps operations running; shortages force crews to make do with worn equipment.
