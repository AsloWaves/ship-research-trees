## Description

> *Optical-grade glass for instruments, periscopes, and rangefinders. Precision manufacturing required for military optics.*

---

## Lore

Glass is the eye of the fleet. Every periscope, rangefinder, binocular, and gunsight depends on precision optical glass to see the enemy. Not ordinary window glass - military optics require special formulations ground to exacting tolerances. One bubble, one imperfection, and the lens is useless.

The expertise to produce optical glass exists in few places. German and Japanese optical industries built reputations on quality glass. Destroying enemy optical production blinds their fleet as surely as physical damage.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Optical glass works | Medium | 3 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial centers | Medium | Premium price |
| Salvage | Optical equipment | Hard | 1-3 units |
| Trade | Specialized suppliers | Medium | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Rangefinders, periscopes, binoculars, gunsights
- **Construction**: Bridge windows, armored viewports
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High demand from optical manufacturers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Sand ×3 + Chemicals ×2 | Melting/Forming | Glass ×2 | Glass Works |
| Glass ×2 + Polishing Compound ×1 | Precision Grinding | Optical Glass ×1 | Optical Shop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~32 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at optical centers, +40% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss), Japan, United States
- **Major Consumers**: Optical instrument manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Skilled labor, precision equipment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Enables targeting and observation
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Optical glass determines fire control capability. Without quality optics, guns can't aim accurately and submarines can't see targets. Glass production capacity directly affects combat effectiveness.
