## Description

> *Heavy-duty woven fabric for covers, bags, and protective equipment. The backbone of naval logistics and protection.*

---

## Lore

Canvas covers everything the navy wants to keep dry. Gun covers, cargo tarps, equipment bags, hammocks - all canvas. This heavy-duty fabric sheds water, resists tearing, and can be shaped into almost anything. Every ship carries more canvas than sailors realize.

The cotton or hemp fibers woven into canvas have served navies for centuries. Modern canvas might be treated with waterproofing compounds, but the fundamental material remains the same. Simple, effective, essential.

Canvas is one of those materials nobody thinks about until it's missing. Then suddenly nothing is covered, nothing is protected, and rain ruins everything. Adequate canvas supply is basic logistics.
