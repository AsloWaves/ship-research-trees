## Description

> *Tanned animal hide for equipment, seals, and personal gear. Durable, flexible, and traditional.*

## Lore

Leather has served warriors for millennia, and navies are no different. From officers' boots to equipment straps, from ammunition pouches to gaskets, leather's unique combination of strength and flexibility makes it irreplaceable for certain applications.

The tanning process transforms raw hides into durable material that resists water, holds shape under stress, and ages gracefully. Naval leather must be especially well-prepared to handle salt air and constant moisture. Quality leather gear is a mark of a properly equipped fighting force.
