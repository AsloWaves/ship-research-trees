## Description

> *Lightweight bark material with natural buoyancy. Essential for life jackets, flotation devices, and vibration dampening.*

---

## Lore

Cork is the difference between drowning and surviving. This remarkable bark floats indefinitely, never waterlogging, never losing its buoyancy. Every life jacket, life ring, and flotation device depends on cork to keep sailors alive when ships go down.

Beyond saving lives, cork's vibration-dampening properties make it valuable for mounting sensitive instruments. It absorbs shock and noise, protecting delicate equipment from the constant vibration of a working warship. Simple bark that saves lives and protects precision instruments.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Harvesting | Cork oak forests | Easy | 20-40 units |
| Purchase | Mediterranean ports | Easy | Very cheap |
| Trade | Portuguese/Spanish merchants | Easy | Bulk quantities |
| Salvage | Life equipment | Easy | 2-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Life jackets, flotation devices, instrument mounts
- **Construction**: Vibration dampening, insulation
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Steady demand for safety equipment

### Processing & Refinement

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -40% in Mediterranean, +25% in Pacific |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Portugal, Spain, North Africa
- **Major Consumers**: All navies (safety equipment)
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration, harvest cycle

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Safety equipment essential but not combat-critical
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Cork matters for crew survival. Adequate cork supply means proper life-saving equipment for every sailor. Shortages force compromises on safety gear that can prove fatal when ships sink.
