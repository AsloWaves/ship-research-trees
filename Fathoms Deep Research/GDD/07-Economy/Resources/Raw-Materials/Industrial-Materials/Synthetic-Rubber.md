## Description

> *Petroleum-derived rubber substitute. Not as good as natural rubber, but it keeps factories running when plantations are out of reach.*

---

## Lore

Synthetic rubber is desperation made practical. When natural rubber sources fell to the enemy, chemists performed miracles - turning petroleum into passable rubber substitutes. It's not perfect, but it keeps the machines running.

The process is complex and energy-intensive, requiring specialized chemical plants and petroleum feedstock. Nations with synthetic rubber capacity can function without tropical imports. Those without must capture plantations or watch their industrial base slowly seize up.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Chemical plants | Medium | 8 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Research | Synthetic rubber program | Medium | Unlocks production |
| Trade | Allied suppliers | Easy | Standard availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Same as natural rubber (with slight quality penalty)
- **Construction**: Seals, gaskets, tires (reduced durability)
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Strategic demand from rubber-poor nations

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Petroleum ×3 + Chemicals ×2 | Polymerization | Synthetic Rubber ×4 | Advanced Chemical Plant |
| Synthetic Rubber ×2 + Sulfur ×1 | Vulcanization | Vulcanized Synthetic ×2 | Chemical Plant |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at chemical plants, +20% in regions without production |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Nations with synthetic rubber programs (US, Germany)
- **Major Consumers**: All industrial operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Petroleum supply, chemical plant capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential substitute
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Producible with right facilities

Synthetic rubber represents industrial independence. Nations that can produce it don't need to fight for rubber plantations. The technology itself is a strategic asset worth protecting.
