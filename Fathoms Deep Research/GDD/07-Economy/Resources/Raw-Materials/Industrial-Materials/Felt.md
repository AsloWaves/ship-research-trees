## Description

> *Non-woven wool fabric for padding, polishing, and sound dampening. Soft but surprisingly useful.*

---

## Lore

Felt is wool transformed by pressure and moisture into dense, uniform fabric. It doesn't fray, absorbs shock and sound, and can be cut to any shape without unraveling. These humble properties make it invaluable for applications nobody thinks about.

Gun mechanisms ride on felt pads that absorb vibration. Optical equipment sits in felt-lined cases. Crews sleep on felt-padded bunks. Anywhere you need cushioning, dampening, or protection, felt quietly does the job without complaint or notice.
