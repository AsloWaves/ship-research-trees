## Description

> *Natural latex from rubber trees. Essential for seals, gaskets, tires, and waterproofing throughout the fleet.*

---

## Lore

Natural rubber is the lifeblood of modern machinery. Every seal, gasket, hose, and tire depends on rubber's unique flexibility and water resistance. Without rubber, engines leak, submarines can't dive, and aircraft sit grounded with flat tires.

The rubber plantations of Southeast Asia produce most of the world's supply. When Japan seized these territories, the Allies faced a rubber crisis that threatened their entire war effort. Controlling rubber sources means controlling industrial capacity itself.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Harvesting | Plantation regions | Easy | 15-25 units |
| Purchase | Tropical ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Trade | Southeast Asian neutrals | Medium | Large quantities |
| Salvage | Industrial facilities | Easy | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Seals, gaskets, hoses, tires, waterproofing
- **Construction**: Submarine seals, machinery mounting
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High strategic demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Rubber ×2 + Sulfur ×1 | Vulcanization | Vulcanized Rubber ×2 | Chemical Plant |
| Rubber ×3 | Molding | Gasket Set ×4 | Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -40% in SE Asia, +50% in blockaded regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Ceylon
- **Major Consumers**: All industrial nations
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration, shipping vulnerability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for all machinery
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Geographically concentrated

Rubber supply determines industrial flexibility. Nations without rubber access must ration it severely, prioritizing military over civilian use. Capturing rubber-producing regions provides massive strategic advantage.
