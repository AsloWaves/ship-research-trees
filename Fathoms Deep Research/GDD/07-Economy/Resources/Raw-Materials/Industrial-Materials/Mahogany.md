## Lore

Mahogany speaks of tradition and quality. This reddish-brown tropical hardwood has graced the finest ships for generations - captain's quarters, wardrooms, charthouses. Officers expect mahogany, and navies that can provide it maintain morale and tradition.

The wood comes from Central American and Caribbean forests, carved from ancient trees and shipped worldwide. Mahogany works easily, takes a beautiful finish, and ages gracefully. It's the wood of command, found wherever officers gather.
