## Description

> *Premium tropical hardwood with exceptional water resistance. The finest choice for ship decking and exterior woodwork.*

---

## Lore

Teak is royalty among woods. Its natural oils repel water and resist rot, making it perfect for ship decking and exterior fittings. Walk the deck of a properly appointed warship and you're walking on teak - smooth, warm underfoot, and impervious to the sea.

The teak forests of Burma and Siam produce the world's finest ship timber. Controlling these regions means access to the best decking material money can buy. Teak decks are a mark of quality, distinguishing first-rate vessels from their lesser cousins.
