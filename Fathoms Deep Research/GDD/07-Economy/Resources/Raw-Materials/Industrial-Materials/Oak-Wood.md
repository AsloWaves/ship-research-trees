## Description

> *Dense, durable hardwood prized for ship interiors and furniture. The traditional choice for quality naval woodwork.*

---

## Lore

Oak has built navies for centuries. Before steel hulls, entire fleets were carved from oak forests. Even in the age of iron, oak remains the choice for quality ship interiors - wardrooms, chart houses, captain's quarters. The weight and warmth of oak says "this is a proper warship."

Beyond aesthetics, oak's density makes it valuable for specialized applications - gun carriages, ammunition handling equipment, anything that needs to absorb shock without splintering. Modern navies still consume significant oak for traditional fittings and functional components.
