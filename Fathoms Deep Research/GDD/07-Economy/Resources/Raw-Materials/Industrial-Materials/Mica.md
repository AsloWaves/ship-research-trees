## Description

> *Transparent mineral insulator essential for electronics. Heat-resistant and electrically non-conductive.*

---

## Lore

Mica is nature's electrical insulator. This crystalline mineral splits into thin, transparent sheets that withstand high temperatures while blocking electrical current completely. Every vacuum tube, every capacitor, every high-voltage device depends on mica to function safely.

The best mica comes from India and Brazil, where pure crystals can be split into sheets thin enough to see through yet strong enough to handle thousands of volts. Radio technology would be impossible without mica - it's the invisible foundation of electronic warfare.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~7 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% near mines, +25% in industrial centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: India (largest), Brazil, Madagascar
- **Major Consumers**: Electronics manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Quality sorting, geographic concentration

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for electronics
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Mica availability determines electronics production capacity. Without mica, radios can't be built, radar can't function, and fire control computers stop working. It's the hidden constraint on electronic warfare capability.
