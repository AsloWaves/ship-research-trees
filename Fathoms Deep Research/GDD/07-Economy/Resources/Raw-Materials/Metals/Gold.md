## Description

> *Precious metal with unmatched electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. Used for critical electrical contacts and as universal currency.*

---

## Lore

Gold is power crystallized. A small bar of gold can purchase what armies cannot take by force - neutral cooperation, diplomatic concessions, intelligence from those who have none to sell. In the shadows of war, gold speaks every language.

But gold also serves in battle. The most critical electrical connections - those in radar sets, fire control systems, communication equipment - are plated with gold. When microseconds matter and a bad connection means missed shots or missed signals, only gold will do. The glitter of gold in a radar set isn't decoration; it's survival.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1400 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (stable store of value) |
| **Regional Variance** | Standard price everywhere (universal value) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Rare mining operations, financial institutions
- **Major Consumers**: Premium electronics manufacturers, diplomatic operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme rarity, high security requirements

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Limited direct military application
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Universal high value
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Gold's primary strategic value is economic rather than military. It provides purchasing power that transcends faction allegiances and enables acquisition of resources through trade when combat seizure is impossible. Gold reserves indicate long-term sustainability.
