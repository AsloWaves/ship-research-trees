## Description

> *Reddish-brown ore containing aluminum oxide. Requires energy-intensive processing to extract aluminum metal for aircraft and ship construction.*

---

## Lore

Bauxite is red dirt that becomes silver wings. The reddish ore looks unremarkable - worthless rock to the untrained eye. But those who understand the war know that bauxite shipments are aircraft carrier decks waiting to be built, seaplane floats yet to be cast.

The great aluminum smelters consume electricity like nothing else - entire hydroelectric dams dedicated to reducing this humble ore into the light metal that dominates the skies. Where the power flows, the bauxite follows. Where the aluminum forms, air power is born.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Tropical and subtropical regions | Easy | 15-35 units |
| Trading | Mining regions | Easy | Very cheap |
| Import | South American, Asian routes | Medium | High volume |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Processed into aluminum metal
- **Construction**: None directly - must be refined first
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Bulk commodity, low value but high volume

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Bauxite ×4 | Bayer Process + Electrolysis | Aluminum ×2 | Aluminum Smelter |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at mining sites, +20% near smelters |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Tropical mining regions
- **Major Consumers**: Aluminum smelters (require massive electricity)
- **Bottlenecks**: Electrical power for smelting, shipping capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Indirect military importance
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - High volume, low margin
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Bauxite is abundant but useless without processing capacity. Its strategic value lies in the aluminum production chain - controlling bauxite matters only if you can smelt it.
