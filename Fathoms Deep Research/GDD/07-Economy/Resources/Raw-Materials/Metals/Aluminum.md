## Description

> *Lightweight aluminum ingots. Critical for aircraft construction and increasingly used in naval superstructures to reduce topweight.*

---

## Lore

Aluminum is the metal of the sky brought to sea. Seaplane tenders and aircraft carriers consume vast quantities, their flight decks and hangars demanding the lightweight strength only aluminum provides. Even traditional warships use it to reduce topweight, improving stability and speed.

The great aluminum smelters require more electricity than entire cities. Control of hydroelectric facilities has become as strategically important as control of oilfields, and more than one dam has been targeted for its aluminum production capacity.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Smelting | Facilities with power | Medium | Crafted from bauxite |
| Trading | Industrial ports | Easy | Market price |
| Salvage | Downed aircraft | Easy | 3-8 units |
| Salvage | Damaged superstructures | Medium | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Aircraft parts, lightweight fittings, Duralumin alloy
- **Construction**: Superstructures, aircraft facilities, weight-critical components
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Steady demand from aviation-focused buyers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Bauxite ×4 | Electrolysis | Aluminum ×2 | Aluminum Smelter |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~3 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% near smelters, +40% at aviation facilities |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Aluminum smelters (require high electricity)
- **Major Consumers**: Aircraft carriers, seaplane tenders, aviation factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Electrical power availability, bauxite supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Aluminum is essential for naval aviation operations. Factions with strong carrier fleets require proportionally larger aluminum supplies. The metal's low weight makes it valuable for speed-focused ship designs.
