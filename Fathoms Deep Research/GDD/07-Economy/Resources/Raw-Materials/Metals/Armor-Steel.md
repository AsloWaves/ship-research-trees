## Description

> *Specially alloyed steel designed to resist penetration. The foundation of warship protection, essential for armor plate production.*

---

## Lore

Armor steel is measured in lives saved. Every inch of properly made armor plate can mean the difference between a ship limping home and a ship becoming a tomb. Captains who've felt shells deflect off their belt armor develop an almost religious appreciation for quality metallurgy.

The secrets of armor steel manufacture are among the most closely guarded in the naval world. Alloy formulas, heat treatment schedules, face-hardening techniques - each represents generations of research and rivers of blood. To capture an enemy's armor mill is to capture their ability to protect their fleet.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Specialized armor mills | Hard | Crafted |
| Trading | Major naval bases | Medium | Premium price |
| Salvage | Heavy warship wrecks | Hard | 3-8 units |
| Capture | Enemy armor facilities | Very Hard | 15-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Armor plates, armored bulkheads, conning tower protection
- **Construction**: Warship armor belt, deck armor, turret faces
- **Consumable**: Armor patch repairs
- **Trade**: High value, restricted availability

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×4 + Nickel ×1 + Chromium ×1 | Alloying | Armor Steel ×2 | Armor Mill |
| Armor Steel ×3 | Face Hardening | Armor Plate ×1 | Armor Mill |
| Armor Steel ×5 + Molybdenum ×1 | Advanced Alloying | STS ×2 | Advanced Armor Mill |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~40 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at armor mills, +40% at forward shipyards |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Specialized armor mills (rare facilities)
- **Major Consumers**: Warship construction, heavy repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Alloying elements (nickel, chromium), specialized equipment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Armor steel directly determines a faction's ability to build and repair protected warships. Without armor steel, only unarmored vessels can be constructed - leaving fleets vulnerable to enemy gunfire. Control of armor production is control of capital ship capability.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Moderate | ×1.0 | Class A armor, reliable quality |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | ×1.1 | Cemented armor tradition |
| Japan | Limited | ×1.4 | VH armor quality issues |
| Germany | Limited | ×1.2 | Krupp KC excellent but limited |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Intentionally scarce - capital ship construction bottleneck
- **Adjustment History**: Stack limit reduced from 25 to 20 to increase scarcity feel
- **Known Issues**: May need faction-specific quality variants
