## Description

> *Dense, soft metal used for radiation shielding, battery plates, ammunition cores, and ballast. Extremely heavy for its size.*

## Lore

Lead is the metal that sinks things - and sometimes saves them. Ballast tanks rely on lead to trim a vessel properly. The batteries that power emergency systems and submarine electric motors depend on lead plates. Even some ammunition uses lead cores for their density.

Handling lead is dirty work. The grey-white metal leaves residue on everything it touches, and experienced sailors know to wash thoroughly after contact. But for all its drawbacks, lead remains indispensable - no other metal combines such density with such workability.

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Lead deposits | Easy | 10-20 units |
| Trading | Most ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Batteries, ballast | Easy | 5-15 units |
| Recycling | Spent batteries | Easy | 3-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Battery plates, ammunition cores, cable sheathing
- **Construction**: Ballast, radiation shielding, soundproofing
- **Consumable**: Battery replacement
- **Trade**: Steady industrial demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% near mines, +10% at submarine bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Mining regions, recycling operations
- **Major Consumers**: Battery manufacturers, submarine depots, ammunition plants
- **Bottlenecks**: Mining capacity, transport (heavy cargo)

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Lead is essential for submarine operations (batteries and ballast) but relatively abundant. Disruption to lead supplies inconveniences rather than cripples a fleet, though submarine operations would suffer significantly.
