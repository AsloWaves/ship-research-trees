## Description

> *Copper-tin alloy prized for corrosion resistance. Essential for propellers, bearings, and any component exposed to seawater.*

## Lore

Bronze is the metal that keeps ships moving. Without bronze propellers, the mightiest engines are useless; without bronze bearings, shafts seize and turbines fail. Engineers treat bronze components with almost superstitious care, knowing that a failed propeller means a ship dead in the water.

The foundries that cast naval bronze work with formulas passed down through generations. A propeller must be perfectly balanced, perfectly cast, perfectly finished - any flaw will cause vibration that can shake a ship apart over time. Master bronze casters are among the most valued craftsmen in any shipyard.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Alloying | Foundries | Medium | Crafted |
| Trading | Naval ports | Easy | Market price |
| Salvage | Shipwrecks (propellers) | Medium | 5-15 units |
| Purchase | Specialty metalworkers | Easy | Premium price |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Propellers, bearings, sea valves, pump components
- **Construction**: Marine fittings, stern tubes, rudder hardware
- **Consumable**: Bearing replacement
- **Trade**: Steady naval demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper ×2 + Tin ×1 | Alloying | Bronze ×2 | Foundry |
| Bronze ×3 | Casting | Propeller Bronze ×2 | Marine Foundry |
| Bronze ×2 | Precision Casting | Bearing Bronze ×3 | Machine Shop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~11 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low-Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -10% at foundries, +20% at repair yards |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Bronze foundries, copper/tin processing regions
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, propeller manufacturers, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Tin supply (relatively rare), skilled casting capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Bronze is essential for maintaining propulsion systems. A fleet without bronze supplies cannot replace damaged propellers or worn bearings, eventually losing mobility. Control of tin sources - the limiting component - provides significant strategic advantage.
