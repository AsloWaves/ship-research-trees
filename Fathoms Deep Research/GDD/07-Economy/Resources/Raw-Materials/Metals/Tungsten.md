## Description

> *Extremely dense tungsten ingots. Essential for armor-piercing ammunition and high-temperature machinery components.*

---

## Lore

Tungsten is the difference between shells that bounce and shells that kill. Captains who've faced battleship armor know the sickening sound of standard rounds deflecting harmlessly - and the satisfaction when tungsten-cored penetrators punch through.

The tungsten trade operates in shadows. Small quantities change hands for enormous sums, and more than one neutral port has been "accidentally" shelled when suspected of supplying the enemy. Possession of tungsten stockpiles marks a faction as a serious naval power.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Rare mountain deposits | Hard | 2-5 units |
| Trading | Black market, neutral ports | Medium | Very expensive |
| Salvage | Destroyed heavy warships | Hard | 1-3 units |
| Special missions | Enemy supply depots | Very Hard | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Armor-piercing shell cores, tool steel, electrical contacts
- **Construction**: Heavy gun barrels, high-performance engine parts
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Extremely valuable, always in demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Tungsten ×1 + Steel ×3 | Alloying | Tool Steel ×2 | Advanced Foundry |
| Tungsten ×2 + Steel ×5 | Forging | AP Shell Cores ×10 | Munitions Factory |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~270 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | +50% in combat zones, -20% near mining regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Remote mountain mining operations, neutral traders
- **Major Consumers**: Ammunition factories, precision engineering facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Extremely limited deposits, dangerous mining locations

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Tungsten availability directly determines a faction's ability to engage armored targets. Without tungsten-cored ammunition, even the largest guns struggle against modern battleship armor. Factions will go to extreme lengths to secure tungsten supplies.
