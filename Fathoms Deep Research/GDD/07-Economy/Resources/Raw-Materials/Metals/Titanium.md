## Description

> *Revolutionary lightweight metal with exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. Emerging technology with limited production capability but tremendous potential.*

---

## Lore

Titanium is tomorrow's metal available today - for those who can produce it. Lighter than steel but just as strong, resistant to corrosion that eats other metals, titanium components represent the future of naval engineering.

The facilities that can produce titanium are rare and experimental. The metal emerges from complex reduction processes that consume vast energy and require exotic techniques. Each ingot represents pioneering metallurgy. Those who master titanium production gain access to capabilities their rivals cannot match.
