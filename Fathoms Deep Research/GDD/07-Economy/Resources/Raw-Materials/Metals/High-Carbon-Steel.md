## Description

> *Hardened steel with elevated carbon content. Excellent for cutting tools, springs, and high-stress machinery components.*

---

## Lore

Engineers speak of high-carbon steel with respect. This isn't the common structural metal that makes up hulls and frames - this is the precision steel that keeps those ships running. The springs in gun recoil mechanisms, the cutting edges of machine tools, the gears in precision instruments - all require high-carbon steel.

A shipyard without high-carbon steel can build hulls but cannot equip them. The distinction between a floating metal box and a fighting warship often comes down to the quality of its high-carbon steel components.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~18 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -10% at steel mills, +30% at shipyards |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Advanced steel mills with heat treatment facilities
- **Major Consumers**: Machine shops, precision manufacturing, weapons factories
- **Bottlenecks**: Heat treatment capacity, manganese supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

High-carbon steel is essential for maintaining manufacturing capability. Without it, machine tools wear out, springs fail, and precision equipment degrades. A faction's industrial sustainability depends on steady high-carbon steel supply.
