## Description

> *Rare alloying element that dramatically increases steel toughness. Essential for shock-resistant applications like springs, crankshafts, and armor.*

---

## Lore

Vanadium is the element that absorbs punishment. Engine crankshafts that spin millions of times without cracking. Springs that compress and release endlessly without fatiguing. Armor that flexes under impact instead of shattering. Vanadium steel takes hits that would destroy ordinary metal.

The difference between vanadium steel and standard steel only shows under stress - under the pounding of heavy seas, the vibration of sustained fire, the shock of near-miss explosions. Equipment made with vanadium endures where lesser metal fails.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Vanadium deposits (rare) | Hard | 3-7 units |
| Trading | Allied industrial centers | Medium | Premium price |
| Salvage | High-stress components | Hard | 1-2 units |
| Import | American supply routes | Medium | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Shock-resistant steel alloys, springs, crankshafts
- **Construction**: High-stress components, impact-resistant structures
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Strategic material, steady demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×4 + Vanadium ×1 | Alloying | Vanadium Steel ×3 | Advanced Steel Mill |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~43 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% in Americas, +50% in Axis territories |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: American mining operations, South American sources
- **Major Consumers**: Engine manufacturers, spring factories, shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration, limited deposits

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Vanadium access determines equipment reliability under stress. Factions with vanadium produce engines that last longer and suspension that handles rough seas better. The difference accumulates over time in reduced maintenance requirements.
