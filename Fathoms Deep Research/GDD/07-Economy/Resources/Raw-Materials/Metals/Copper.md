## Description

> *Refined copper ingots with distinctive reddish-orange color. Essential for electrical systems, ammunition casings, and bronze alloys.*

## Lore

The distinctive reddish gleam of copper is a welcome sight in any cargo hold. Electricians prize it for repairs, armorers need it for ammunition, and every shipyard demands steady supplies. Copper convoys rarely travel unescorted - the metal is simply too valuable.

Old sailors call copper "the nervous system of the ship." Without it, radars go blind, guns fall silent, and engines lose their spark. A ship starved of copper is a ship waiting to die.
