## Description

> *Heavy refined oil that keeps machinery running smooth. Without it, engines seize, turrets freeze, and ships die.*

---

## Lore

Lubricating oil is invisible until it's gone - then everything stops. Every moving part on a warship depends on a thin film of oil separating metal from metal. Engines, turbines, gun mounts, steering gear - all need constant lubrication or they grind themselves to destruction.

The engineering crews who maintain shipboard machinery are measured by their oil consumption. Too little means worn bearings and seized mechanisms. Too much means waste and fire risk. The perfect balance keeps a fighting ship in the fight. Run dry of lubricating oil and the mightiest battleship becomes a floating hulk.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Refining | Oil refineries | Medium | 1 per 4 crude oil |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Engine rooms | Medium | 3-8 units |
| Recycling | Used oil | Hard | 1 per 2 used oil |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Machine maintenance kits, grease production
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Engine maintenance, machinery operation
- **Trade**: Steady demand from all ship operators

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Crude Oil ×4 | Heavy Distillation | Lubricating Oil ×1 + other products | Oil Refinery |
| Lubricating Oil ×2 + Additives ×1 | Enhancement | Synthetic Lube ×2 | Chemical Plant |
| Lubricating Oil ×3 + Lithium ×1 | Mixing | Marine Grease ×5 | Workshop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~10 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low-Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at refineries, +25% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Oil refineries with lube oil processing
- **Major Consumers**: All powered vessels, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Quality requirements limit production

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for all powered operations
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Lubricating oil shortage degrades fleet capability gradually but inevitably. Engines run hotter, wear faster, and eventually fail. Maintaining lube oil supplies is essential for long-term fleet operations.
