## Description

> *Premium hard coal with high carbon content. Burns hotter and cleaner than standard coal - preferred for specialized applications.*

---

## Lore

Anthracite is coal perfected by time and pressure - millions of years compressed into dense, hard lumps of nearly pure carbon. It burns hotter than ordinary coal, with less smoke and ash. For applications where heat quality matters, anthracite is worth the premium.

The best anthracite comes from deep mines where ancient seams have been compressed to their ultimate density. Metallurgists prefer it for precision work where temperature control matters. Some claim you can tell an experienced coal hand by whether they can identify anthracite by touch alone.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Mining | Deep coal deposits | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Easy | Slight premium |
| Sorting | From mixed coal | Easy | 1 anthracite per 3 coal |
| Trade | Pennsylvania/Welsh regions | Easy | Quality guaranteed |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: High-quality steel, precision metallurgy
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Premium heating, specialized industrial processes
- **Trade**: Steady demand from quality-focused operations

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Anthracite ×8 + Iron Ore ×5 | Premium Smelting | High-Grade Pig Iron ×5 | Blast Furnace |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% in Pennsylvania/Wales, +40% in Pacific |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Deep mining operations (limited geographic distribution)
- **Major Consumers**: Quality steel mills, precision metallurgy
- **Bottlenecks**: Geographic concentration of deposits

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Quality improvement role
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Anthracite enables higher-quality steel production but isn't essential - standard coal works for most purposes. Its value lies in optimization rather than necessity. Quality-focused operations pay the premium; others make do.
