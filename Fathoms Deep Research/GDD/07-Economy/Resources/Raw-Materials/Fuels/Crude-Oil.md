## Description

> *Unrefined petroleum straight from the well. The lifeblood of modern warfare - useless without refineries, invaluable with them.*

---

## Lore

Crude oil is black gold - the thick, pungent liquid that powers fleets. In its raw form, it's nearly useless. Ships cannot burn crude directly. But channel it through refineries and it becomes everything: the bunker fuel that drives battleships, the diesel that propels destroyers, the aviation gasoline that launches fighters.

The oil convoys are the highest-value targets in any theater. Sink the tankers and you strand the fleet. Protect them and you project power across oceans. Every major naval operation begins with the question: do we have enough oil?

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Oil Fields | Production zones | Medium | 15-30 units |
| Trading | Major ports | Medium | High cost |
| Capture | Enemy tankers | Hard | 10-50 units |
| Salvage | Sunken tankers | Hard | 5-15 units (contaminated) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Refined into all petroleum products
- **Construction**: N/A (requires refining first)
- **Consumable**: N/A (cannot be used directly)
- **Trade**: High value strategic commodity

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Crude Oil ×5 | Fractional Distillation | Bunker Fuel ×3 + Diesel ×2 + Kerosene ×1 | Oil Refinery |
| Crude Oil ×3 | Light Cracking | Aviation Gasoline ×2 | Advanced Refinery |
| Crude Oil ×2 | Lubricant Extraction | Lubricating Oil ×3 | Oil Refinery |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~50 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -40% in production zones, +100% in oil-poor regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Middle East, American Gulf, Dutch East Indies, Venezuela
- **Major Consumers**: Every faction - absolute necessity
- **Bottlenecks**: Refinery capacity, tanker availability, shipping route security

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Oil is the foundation of naval power. Without it, ships sit at anchor. The entire game economy ultimately traces back to oil access. Controlling oil production zones and protecting tanker routes is essential for any faction seeking to project power.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | ×0.6 | Domestic production exceeds consumption |
| United Kingdom | Limited | ×1.2 | Dependent on Middle East/Venezuela |
| Japan | Very Scarce | ×2.5 | Catastrophic shortage - priority target |
| Germany | Scarce | ×1.8 | Romanian fields, synthetic production |
