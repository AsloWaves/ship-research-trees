## Description

> *High-octane fuel for aircraft engines. Requires specialized refining and careful handling - the fuel that keeps carrier air groups flying.*

---

## Lore

Aviation gasoline is liquid power - refined to perfection, volatile beyond measure, and absolutely essential for carrier operations. The high-octane fuel allows aircraft engines to run at peak performance, squeezing every ounce of power from straining cylinders.

Carriers store their avgas in heavily protected tanks, knowing that a single hit to the fuel storage can turn a fighting ship into a floating pyre. The men who handle avgas treat it with appropriate respect - one spark in the wrong place and there's nothing left but burning wreckage on the sea.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Refining | Advanced refineries | Hard | 2 per 3 crude oil |
| Purchase | Major ports | Medium | Premium price |
| Capture | Enemy carriers | Very Hard | 15-40 units |
| Salvage | Aircraft wrecks | Hard | 1-3 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: N/A (end product)
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: ✅ Aircraft operations, carrier air groups
- **Trade**: Very high demand from carrier operators

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Crude Oil ×3 | Catalytic Cracking | Aviation Gasoline ×2 | Advanced Refinery |
| Aviation Gasoline + Additives | Blending | High-Octane Fuel ×1 | Chemical Plant |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~42 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at advanced refineries, +50% at forward bases |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Advanced refineries with cracking capacity
- **Major Consumers**: Carriers, seaplane tenders, naval air stations
- **Bottlenecks**: Advanced refinery availability, safe storage requirements

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Enables naval air power
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Aviation gasoline determines carrier operational capability. Without it, aircraft sit useless on deck. Control of avgas production directly determines who rules the air over the fleet.
