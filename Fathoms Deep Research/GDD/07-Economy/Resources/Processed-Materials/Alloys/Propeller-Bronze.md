## Description

> *Specialized bronze alloy for ship propellers. Resists corrosion and cavitation in seawater.*

---

## Lore

Propeller bronze is an alloy engineered for one of the harshest environments imaginable. Ship propellers spin in corrosive seawater at thousands of RPM, subjected to cavitation that would eat through ordinary metals in weeks. Only specially formulated bronze can survive this punishment.

The alloy combines copper with aluminum, nickel, and manganese in precise proportions. The result resists saltwater corrosion, shrugs off cavitation damage, and maintains strength under constant stress. A good propeller can last the lifetime of a ship. A poor one can fail catastrophically, leaving a vessel dead in the water.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Bronze Foundry | Medium | 4 per batch |
| Purchase | Shipyard ports | Medium | Standard price |
| Salvage | Damaged propellers | Medium | 2-5 units |
| Trade | Metal merchants | Medium | Moderate availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Ship propellers, shaft bearings, underwater fittings
- **Construction**: Propulsion systems, sea valves
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Steady shipyard demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper ×3 + Aluminum ×1 + Nickel ×1 | Precision Alloying | Propeller Bronze ×3 | Bronze Foundry |
| Propeller Bronze ×6 | Casting/Machining | Ship Propeller ×1 | Propeller Works |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~53 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at foundries, +20% remote ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Bronze foundries with marine specialization
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper and nickel supply, expertise

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for propulsion
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Without propeller bronze, ships don't move. Propeller damage is common in combat, and replacement propellers require this specialized alloy. A shortage means ships stuck in port or limping home on damaged screws.
