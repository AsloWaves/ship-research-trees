## Description

> *Standard naval armor plating for ship protection. The first line of defense against enemy fire.*

---

## Lore

Armor plate is where metallurgy meets warfare. These thick steel plates, specially treated and hardened, stand between a ship's crew and destruction. Every plate must be perfect - a flaw invisible to the eye can mean the difference between deflecting a shell and catastrophic penetration.

The process of creating armor plate is as much art as science. Steel must be precisely alloyed, carefully heated, and skillfully hardened. The largest plates require massive facilities and experienced workers. When a shell strikes armor plate, centuries of metallurgical knowledge are put to the ultimate test.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~66 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at steel production centers, +40% in combat zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Major industrial nations with steel works
- **Major Consumers**: Naval shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Nickel supply, rolling mill capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for warship protection
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Armor plate availability directly determines a navy's ability to build and repair warships. Control of armor production means control of naval power. Damage to armor plate facilities can cripple a nation's ability to wage war at sea.
