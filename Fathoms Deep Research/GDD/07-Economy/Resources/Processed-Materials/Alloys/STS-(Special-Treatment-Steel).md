## Description

> *American homogeneous armor steel for splinter protection and structural armor. Tough throughout its thickness.*

---

## Lore

STS represents the American approach to naval protection: tough, practical, and versatile. Unlike face-hardened armor, STS is homogeneous - equally hard throughout its thickness. It won't stop the heaviest shells, but it excels at defeating splinters, bomb fragments, and smaller projectiles.

The steel receives special heat treatment that maximizes toughness without brittleness. STS can be welded, cut, and worked more easily than cemented armor, making it ideal for decks, splinter bulkheads, and structural armor. American destroyers and aircraft carriers rely heavily on STS for their protection schemes.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Advanced Steel Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | American facilities | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Damaged warships | Medium | 3-6 units |
| Trade | Allied naval yards | Hard | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Deck armor, splinter protection, structural armor
- **Construction**: Carrier flight decks, destroyer protection, bulkheads
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High naval demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×4 + Nickel ×1 + Molybdenum ×1 | Special Treatment | STS ×2 | Advanced Steel Works |
| STS ×4 | Installation | Deck Armor Section ×1 | Shipyard |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~300 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at American yards, +35% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States primarily
- **Major Consumers**: Carrier and destroyer construction
- **Bottlenecks**: Molybdenum supply, heat treatment capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for modern warship protection
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

STS fills the gap between structural steel and heavy armor. It protects against the threats that actually damage most warships - splinters, fragments, and strafing fire. Modern naval warfare makes STS increasingly important as air attacks become more deadly.
