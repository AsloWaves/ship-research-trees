## Description

> *Specially alloyed steel for naval gun barrels. Engineered to withstand extreme pressures and temperatures.*

---

## Lore

Gun steel is metallurgy pushed to its limits. A naval gun barrel must contain explosive pressures of over 20 tons per square inch while guiding a shell at thousands of feet per second. It must do this thousands of times without cracking, warping, or exploding. The margin for error is zero.

Creating gun steel requires precise control of carbon, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum content. Too hard and the barrel cracks. Too soft and it wears out rapidly. The perfect gun steel balances toughness with hardness, and only the most advanced metallurgical facilities can produce it reliably.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Advanced Steel Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Naval arsenals | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Damaged gun mounts | Hard | 1-3 units |
| Contract | Government facilities | Medium | Quest reward |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Gun barrels, breech mechanisms, recoil systems
- **Construction**: Naval artillery, anti-aircraft guns
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Military-only demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel ×3 + Nickel ×1 + Chromium ×1 | Precision Alloying | Gun Steel ×2 | Advanced Steel Works |
| Gun Steel ×4 | Barrel Forging | Gun Barrel ×1 | Arsenal |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~56 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at arsenals, +35% in combat zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Military-industrial arsenals
- **Major Consumers**: Gun foundries, naval shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Alloy material supply, specialized expertise

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - No guns without gun steel
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Gun steel production determines how many guns a navy can field. Barrel wear requires constant replacement, so demand never stops. A shortage of gun steel means a navy fighting with worn-out weapons.
