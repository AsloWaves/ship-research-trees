## Description

> *Lightweight aluminum alloy for aircraft and superstructures. Strong as steel at a fraction of the weight.*

---

## Lore

Duralumin made aviation possible. This remarkable alloy combines aluminum's light weight with strength approaching steel. Aircraft that would be too heavy to fly with steel frames soar with duralumin structures. Naval aviation owes its existence to this material.

The alloy contains copper, magnesium, and manganese in precise proportions, then undergoes age-hardening to develop maximum strength. It corrodes more easily than pure aluminum, requiring protective coatings, but nothing else offers the same strength-to-weight ratio. Every carrier aircraft, every flying boat, every seaplane floats on duralumin.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Aluminum Works | Medium | 6 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Aircraft/structures | Medium | 3-10 units |
| Trade | Metal merchants | Easy | Good availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Aircraft structures, light superstructures, weight-critical components
- **Construction**: Seaplane floats, carrier aircraft, mast structures
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High aviation demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Aluminum ×3 + Copper ×1 | Age-Hardening | Duralumin ×4 | Aluminum Works |
| Duralumin ×5 | Fabrication | Aircraft Frame Section ×1 | Aircraft Factory |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~10 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at aluminum works, +20% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Nations with aluminum production
- **Major Consumers**: Aircraft manufacturers, naval aviation
- **Bottlenecks**: Aluminum supply, bauxite access

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for aviation
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Duralumin availability determines aviation production capacity. Without it, aircraft can't be built and carriers become floating airfields with no planes. Control of duralumin supply means control of air power at sea.
