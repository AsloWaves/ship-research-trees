## Description

> *High-tin bronze alloy for shaft bearings and friction surfaces. Self-lubricating and wear-resistant.*

---

## Lore

Bearing bronze keeps ships running smoothly. This specialized alloy contains high tin content that gives it remarkable properties - it's naturally slippery, resists wear, and works well with lubricating oil. Every propeller shaft, every turbine, every rotating mechanism depends on bearing bronze.

The alloy must be precisely formulated. Too little tin and it wears too fast. Too much and it becomes brittle. The best bearing bronze comes from foundries with generations of experience, where metallurgists know by instinct when the mix is right. A good bearing can last years of constant use. A poor one can seize and destroy machinery worth millions.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at foundries, +25% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Bronze foundries with precision capability
- **Major Consumers**: Engine manufacturers, shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Tin supply, precision manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for propulsion machinery
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Bearing bronze is the hidden foundation of naval machinery. Without it, propeller shafts don't turn, turbines seize, and ships become immobile hulks. Bearing wear is constant, creating perpetual demand for replacement material.
