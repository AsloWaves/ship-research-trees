## Description

> *Precision steel spheres for reducing friction in rotating machinery. The smooth motion of every mechanism depends on them.*

---

## Lore

Ball bearings are tiny marvels of precision engineering. Each sphere must be perfectly round to millionths of an inch, hardened to withstand enormous loads, and polished to mirror smoothness. They enable the smooth rotation of everything from gun turrets to propeller shafts.

The Allies recognized ball bearings as a strategic chokepoint - German ball bearing plants were priority bombing targets because every tank, aircraft, and ship needed them. Destroying ball bearing production could cripple an enemy's war machine. In Fathoms Deep, wise commanders stockpile bearings against future shortages.
