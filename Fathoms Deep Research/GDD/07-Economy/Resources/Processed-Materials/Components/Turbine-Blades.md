## Description

> *Heat-resistant alloy blades for steam turbines. Precision airfoils that extract power from superheated steam.*

---

## Lore

Turbine blades spin in the heart of steam at temperatures that would melt ordinary steel. Row upon row of precisely shaped airfoils extract energy from expanding steam, converting thermal energy to rotation at thousands of RPM. The blades must resist heat, erosion, vibration, and centrifugal forces that would tear lesser materials apart.

Manufacturing turbine blades requires exotic alloys and exacting precision. Each blade is individually balanced and inspected. A single failed blade can cascade into catastrophic turbine destruction as broken pieces tear through subsequent rows. Turbine blade quality directly determines ship performance and reliability.
