## Description

> *Coiled steel wire for mechanical energy storage and shock absorption. The bounce in every mechanism.*

---

## Lore

Springs store energy, absorb shock, and return mechanisms to position. They're everywhere aboard ship - in gun recoil systems, valve mechanisms, hatches, instruments, and a thousand other applications. The simple coil of tempered steel wire is one of engineering's most versatile components.

Gun recoil springs are the most demanding application. They must absorb the tremendous energy of a firing gun, then smoothly return the barrel to battery. These springs are made from the finest spring steel, heat-treated to exact specifications, and tested rigorously. A failed recoil spring can jam a gun at the worst possible moment.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - widely available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Any industrial nation
- **Major Consumers**: All machinery manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Quality spring steel supply

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential for gun mechanisms
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Springs are cheap and common but essential. Gun recoil systems, in particular, depend on spring quality. A failed spring at the wrong moment can cost lives. Quality control matters more than quantity.
