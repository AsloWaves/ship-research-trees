## Description

> *Precision-machined cylinders for reciprocating engines. The pistons that pump power into propellers.*

---

## Lore

Pistons are the working heart of diesel and gasoline engines. They slide up and down in their cylinders thousands of times per minute, transmitting the explosive force of combustion into rotary motion. Naval pistons must be machined to exacting tolerances, perfectly round and precisely sized to their cylinders.

The thermal expansion of pistons under operating temperatures requires careful design. Too tight and they seize. Too loose and they lose compression. The best pistons are made from aluminum alloys that match the expansion characteristics of their cylinder liners, maintaining the perfect fit across the entire operating range.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for diesel-powered vessels
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Pistons are critical wear items for reciprocating engines. Diesel submarines and destroyers depend on them. A piston failure can destroy an engine, and replacement requires either spare pistons or a machine shop capable of manufacturing them.
