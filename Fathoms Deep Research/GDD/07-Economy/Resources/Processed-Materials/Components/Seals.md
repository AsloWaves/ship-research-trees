## Description

> *Rubber and leather sealing rings for rotating shafts and moving parts. Keeps fluids in and contamination out.*

---

## Lore

Where gaskets seal static joints, seals handle the harder task of sealing rotating or reciprocating shafts. They must provide tight contact while allowing motion, preventing oil from escaping pumps, water from entering bearings, and air from leaking around valves. It's a delicate balance of friction and sealing.

Seals wear out faster than almost any other component. The constant rubbing eventually erodes even the best materials. Smart engineers track seal life religiously, replacing them on schedule before failure. A blown seal can drain an entire hydraulic system in minutes or let seawater into critical machinery.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - widely available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Rubber processing facilities
- **Major Consumers**: All machinery operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Rubber supply, especially natural rubber

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Basic maintenance item
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Seals are consumables that every ship needs in quantity. Running out doesn't stop operations immediately, but machinery deteriorates rapidly without proper sealing. Steady seal supply keeps fleets operational.
