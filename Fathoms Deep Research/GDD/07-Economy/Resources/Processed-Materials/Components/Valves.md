## Description

> *Flow control devices for piping systems. The traffic controllers of every fluid system aboard ship.*

---

## Lore

Valves control everything that flows aboard ship. Steam to turbines, fuel to boilers, water to firefighting systems, hydraulic fluid to gun mounts - every flow path has valves to start it, stop it, or regulate it. A single warship might have thousands of valves, each one critical to its system's function.

Naval valves must work reliably under pressure, temperature extremes, and the shock of combat. They come in countless varieties - gate valves, globe valves, check valves, relief valves - each designed for specific applications. Knowing which valve to use where is fundamental engineering knowledge.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential ship equipment
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Valves are critical control points. A stuck valve can cause flooding, a failed relief valve can cause explosions, a damaged isolation valve can mean losing entire systems. Proper valve function is fundamental to ship safety.
