## Description

> *Sealing materials for pipe flanges and equipment joints. Prevents leaks in pressurized systems.*

---

## Lore

Gaskets are the unsung heroes of pressure systems. Cut from cork, rubber, asbestos, or metal, they compress between flanges to create leak-proof seals. Steam lines, hydraulic systems, fuel piping - anything under pressure needs gaskets at every joint.

A ship's gasket inventory is a snapshot of its entire piping system. Different materials suit different temperatures and pressures. Cork for low-pressure water. Asbestos for steam. Metal for the highest pressures. One wrong gasket can mean a steam leak that scalds, a fuel leak that burns, or a hydraulic failure that cripples a gun mount.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - widely available |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Rubber and cork processing centers
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: Rubber supply for synthetic types

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Basic maintenance material
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Gaskets are cheap but essential. Every pipe joint needs one, and they wear out regularly. Smart engineers stockpile gaskets in every size and material their systems use.
