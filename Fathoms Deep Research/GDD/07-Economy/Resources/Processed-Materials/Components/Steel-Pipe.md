## Description

> *Seamless steel tubing for pressure systems and structural applications. The arteries of every ship.*

## Lore

Steel pipe carries the lifeblood of ships - fuel, steam, water, hydraulic fluid, compressed air. Miles of piping thread through every warship, connecting boilers to turbines, fuel tanks to engines, hydraulic pumps to gun mounts. The quality of pipe determines whether those systems work reliably or fail catastrophically.

Seamless pipe is drawn from solid steel billets, eliminating the weak seam of welded pipe. It can handle higher pressures, resist corrosion better, and last longer under stress. For critical applications - steam lines, hydraulic systems, fuel piping - only seamless pipe is acceptable.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~10 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | -15% at steel centers, +15% remote areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Steel producing nations

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Essential ship construction material
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Steel pipe is unglamorous but utterly essential. No ship can function without proper piping systems. Damage to piping from combat or accidents can cripple a vessel as surely as a torpedo hit.
