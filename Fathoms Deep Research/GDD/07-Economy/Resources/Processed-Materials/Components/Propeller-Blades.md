## Description

> *Massive cast bronze propeller sections. The blades that grip the sea and drive ships forward.*

## Lore

Propeller blades are where hydrodynamics meets metallurgy. Each blade is a carefully sculpted airfoil shape, cast from propeller bronze and machined to precise contours. The curve, pitch, and rake of every blade must be exact - tiny variations create vibration that can shake a ship apart at speed.

Damage to propeller blades is common in naval operations. Grounding, debris strikes, and combat damage can bend, crack, or break blades. Replacement requires either drydocking or dangerous underwater work. A spare propeller blade is worth its weight in gold to a ship operating far from friendly ports.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Propeller Works | Very Hard | 1 per batch |
| Purchase | Major shipyards | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Damaged propellers | Hard | 0-2 units |
| Contract | Naval yard | Hard | Major quest reward |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Ship propellers, propeller repairs
- **Construction**: Propulsion systems
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Extreme demand for capital ships

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Propeller Bronze ×5 | Casting/Machining | Propeller Blades ×1 | Propeller Works |
| Propeller Blades ×3-5 | Assembly | Complete Propeller ×1 | Major Shipyard |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1600 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -30% at propeller works, +50% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Nations with specialized propeller foundries
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ship operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Propeller bronze supply, precision casting capability

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Critical propulsion component
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Propeller blades are among the most critical spare parts any ship can carry. Blade damage is common, and replacement options at sea are limited. A spare blade can mean the difference between reaching port and being towed.
