## Description

> *Precision-cut toothed wheels for transmitting power and motion. The mechanical heart of reduction gears and machinery.*

---

## Lore

Gears transform power - changing speed for torque, direction for direction, or simply transmitting motion where shafts cannot reach. Naval gears must be cut with precision, heat-treated for hardness, and finished to tolerances that would impress watchmakers. A single gear in a ship's reduction drive might be six feet across yet accurate to thousandths of an inch.

The sound of well-made gears is a quiet hum. The sound of failing gears is a screech that haunts engineers' nightmares. Gear tooth breakage can cascade through an entire drive train, turning thousands of horsepower into scrap metal in seconds. Good gears are worth every credit.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Essential for propulsion and weapons
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Gears are the mechanical foundation of naval propulsion. Turbines spin at thousands of RPM; propellers need hundreds. Only precision reduction gears can bridge that gap efficiently. Gear failure means ships dead in the water.
