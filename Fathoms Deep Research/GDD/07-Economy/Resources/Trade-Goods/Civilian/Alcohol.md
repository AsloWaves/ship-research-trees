## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Spirits, rum, whiskey, and other alcoholic beverages for naval rations and morale. Traditional rum rations boost crew spirits, while medical alcohol serves practical purposes.

## Lore

The Royal Navy's rum ration is sacred tradition - "splice the mainbrace" means extra rum for celebrating victories or surviving battles. American Navy officially goes dry during Prohibition, but medicinal alcohol flows freely. Submarine crews receive whiskey rations for completing dangerous patrols. German U-boat commanders distribute schnapps before attacks. Japanese sake ceremonies mark successful missions. Alcohol serves triple duty: morale booster, antiseptic, and currency. Blockade runners smuggle premium spirits to neutral ports for massive profits. Captured enemy alcohol gets redistributed to victorious crews. Medical alcohol treats wounds and sterilizes instruments. Shore leave means drinking away stress in every port.
