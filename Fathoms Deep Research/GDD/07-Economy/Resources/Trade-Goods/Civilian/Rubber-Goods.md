## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Processed rubber products including gaskets, seals, hoses, and waterproofing materials. Essential for maintaining watertight integrity and preventing machinery leaks aboard warships.

---

## Lore

Rubber is the unsung hero of naval warfare. Every ship depends on thousands of rubber seals, gaskets, and hoses to keep seawater out and steam in. Japanese conquest of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies cuts off 90% of Allied natural rubber supply, triggering desperate synthetic rubber development programs. German U-boats target rubber shipments knowing that ships without gaskets can't maintain steam pressure or watertight compartments. Brazilian rubber makes fortunes for smugglers running blockades. Damaged submarines need rubber seals for emergency repairs - one leaking gasket can doom an entire boat. American synthetic rubber programs eventually produce adequate substitutes, but natural rubber remains superior for critical applications.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | Extreme - 3x in Pacific late-war, 0.8x in source regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Brazil, Liberia (natural); US (synthetic)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces, industrial maintenance, vehicle production
- **Bottlenecks**: Japanese occupation, convoy attacks, synthetic production capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Rubber is war-critical infrastructure material. Japanese seizure of rubber-producing regions creates immediate crisis for Allied forces. Without rubber, ships can't maintain watertight integrity, aircraft can't land safely, and vehicles can't operate. The rubber shortage drives massive American investment in synthetic alternatives. Control of rubber sources directly impacts military capability.
