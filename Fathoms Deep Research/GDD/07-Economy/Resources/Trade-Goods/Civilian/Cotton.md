## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Raw cotton fiber bales used for textile production and industrial applications. Essential for manufacturing uniforms, sail canvas, and fire-fighting equipment aboard naval vessels.

## Lore

American cotton dominates global markets, with Southern states producing vast quantities despite wartime labor shortages. The Royal Navy needs cotton for damage control equipment - fire hoses, canvas patches, and insulating materials. Cotton also produces high-quality gunpowder when processed into nitrocellulose. Neutral merchant ships run cotton through blockades, making fortunes supplying both sides. Japanese forces seize Indian and Egyptian cotton supplies to feed their textile mills. Cotton may seem mundane, but naval operations depend on it for everything from sailors' uniforms to fire suppression equipment.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Trading | Southern US ports, Egypt, India | Easy | 50-80 units |
| Blockade Running | Neutral ports | High | 100-150 units |
| Convoy Cargo | Trans-Atlantic routes | Medium | 80-120 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Processed into textiles, uniforms, canvas, and industrial materials
- **Construction**: Used for crew quarters, damage control supplies, sail canvas
- **Consumable**: Not directly consumable, must be processed first
- **Trade**: High demand in industrial regions, profitable blockade running cargo

| **Base Value** | ~1 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | High in Europe/Asia (1.8x), Low in US South (0.7x) |

### Supply Chain

- **Major Consumers**: Industrial nations, naval supply depots, uniform manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Harvest seasons, blockades, shipping capacity, processing facilities

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Cotton is economically significant but not immediately war-critical. However, its role in textile production, damage control equipment, and even explosives manufacturing gives it strategic value. Nations that control cotton supplies can outfit more sailors and maintain better damage control capabilities. Blockade runners prize cotton for its high profit margins in cut-off markets.
