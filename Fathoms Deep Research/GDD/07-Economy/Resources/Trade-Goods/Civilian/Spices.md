## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Exotic spices from Asia and the Indies, highly valued for preserving food and improving bland naval rations. Compact, lightweight, and extremely profitable cargo.

---

## Lore

Spices transform inedible preserved rations into something sailors will actually eat. Pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves mask the taste of salt pork that's been in barrel for months. Dutch and British control of spice-producing islands creates strategic economic leverage. Japanese occupation of the Moluccas disrupts centuries-old spice routes. Blockade runners make fortunes smuggling small quantities of high-value spices - a single chest can pay for an entire voyage. Naval galleys prize spices for keeping crews fed without complaint. Officers use spice rations as rewards for good performance. German raiders specifically target spice shipments for their economic value.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Spices are economically vital but militarily secondary. Their extreme value-to-weight ratio makes them ideal smuggling cargo. Control of spice-producing regions generates enormous wealth. While not essential for combat, spices significantly improve crew morale through better food quality. The most profitable non-military cargo available.
