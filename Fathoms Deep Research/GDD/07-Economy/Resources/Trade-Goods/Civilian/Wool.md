## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

High-quality wool fiber from sheep, essential for cold-weather naval uniforms and winter gear. Prized by Northern Atlantic and Arctic convoy crews for its insulating properties.

---

## Lore

British and Australian wool keeps Allied sailors warm in the brutal North Atlantic. Royal Navy peacoats, watch caps, and thermal underwear all depend on wool supplies from Commonwealth producers. German U-boat crews shiver in synthetic substitutes as the British blockade chokes off wool imports. Wool is survival gear for sailors battling North Atlantic gales and Arctic convoy routes to Murmansk. New Zealand's sheep stations work overtime to supply military contracts while Australian wool convoys dodge Japanese raiders in the Indian Ocean.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Wool is essential for naval operations in cold climates. Crews without proper wool gear suffer morale penalties and frostbite in Arctic waters. The Murmansk convoy runs and North Atlantic patrols absolutely require wool clothing. While not war-critical like ammunition, wool determines whether sailors can effectively operate in harsh conditions.
