## Lore

Textiles are the fabric of naval life - literally. Every sailor needs uniforms, every ship needs canvas for damage control and weather protection, every base needs tarps and tents. British textile mills work triple shifts producing naval uniforms and canvas. Japanese silk textile production switches to parachute manufacturing. American cotton mills supply Allied forces with standardized fabrics. Textiles seem mundane until a damaged ship needs canvas patches for shrapnel holes or a forward base lacks tents for incoming troops. Quartermaster depots stockpile textiles by the ton. Captured textile shipments provide enemy forces with uniform material.

| Salvage | Damaged facilities, captured supplies | Medium | 25-35 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Uniforms, canvas patches, tents, tarps, flags
- **Construction**: Crew quarters, temporary shelters, weather protection
- **Consumable**: Used for emergency patches (minor hull repair)

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~4 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Moderate - 1.4x in Pacific islands, 0.9x in industrial regions |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom, India, Japan (industrial regions)
- **Major Consumers**: Military supply chains, uniform production, naval logistics
- **Bottlenecks**: Cotton/wool supply, manufacturing capacity, shipping

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Textiles are logistically important but not immediately war-critical. However, troops without proper uniforms suffer morale penalties, ships without canvas can't make emergency repairs, and bases without tents can't house personnel. Steady textile supply maintains operational effectiveness. Control of textile production supports military logistics.
