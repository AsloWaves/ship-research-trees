## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Dried tea leaves from India, Ceylon, and China, absolutely essential for maintaining British naval morale. A Royal Navy without tea rations is unthinkable - it's survival cargo.

---

## Lore

Tea isn't just a beverage for the Royal Navy - it's a strategic morale resource as critical as ammunition. British sailors receive daily tea rations regardless of circumstances. Convoys from Ceylon and India risk U-boat attacks to keep tea flowing to Britain. When HMS Hood went down, survivors clung to wreckage drinking tea from emergency kits. German raiders specifically target tea shipments to damage British morale. Japanese occupation of Asian tea plantations forces Britain to protect alternate supply routes. A ship without tea suffers measurable morale penalties - British crews simply won't fight effectively without their daily cuppa.

Tea is uniquely critical to British naval operations. It's not technically military hardware, but British morale systems absolutely require it. Ships without adequate tea supplies suffer crew efficiency penalties. The psychological impact of tea rationing affects combat performance. Churchill himself prioritized tea shipments as strategic cargo. Lose tea supplies, lose British fighting spirit.
