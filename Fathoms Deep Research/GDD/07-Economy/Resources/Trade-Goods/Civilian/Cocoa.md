## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Raw cocoa beans from tropical plantations, used for chocolate production and morale supplies. Popular trade good that provides comfort to weary naval crews.

---

## Lore

Chocolate isn't just candy - it's concentrated calories and morale in a compact package. Naval powers stockpile chocolate for emergency rations and crew rewards. Hershey develops special "Ration D" chocolate bars that won't melt in tropical heat, packed into life rafts and survival kits. British sailors receive chocolate as part of rum ration alternatives. West African cocoa plantations work overtime supplying Allied chocolate factories. Submarine crews particularly value chocolate for its calorie density and shelf stability. A small piece of chocolate can lift spirits during the darkest moments of patrol. Swiss neutrality means chocolate flows to both sides through smuggling networks.
