## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Milled grain processed into fine flour, essential for shipboard baking and emergency rations. More compact than raw grain, ideal for long-duration convoy missions and submarine patrols.

---

## Lore

Processed flour is the final form of grain before it reaches ship galleys and forward supply depots. Port mills work around the clock converting raw grain into flour for naval provisions. Flour takes up less cargo space than grain and keeps longer in the damp conditions of ship holds, making it preferable for long-range operations. U-boats and submarines particularly value flour for its shelf stability - a submarine on extended patrol can't afford spoiled provisions. British Ministry of Food strictly controls flour distribution, ensuring naval vessels have priority over civilian bakeries.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Milling | Major ports with mills | Easy | 30-50 units |
| Supply Depot Trading | Naval supply bases | Easy | 20-40 units |
| Convoy Cargo | Atlantic/Pacific routes | Medium | 50-100 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Used to craft ship rations and emergency survival kits
- **Construction**: Required for establishing crew quarters and mess facilities
- **Consumable**: Improves crew morale, prevents scurvy when combined with other supplies
- **Trade**: Moderate demand, better profit margins than raw grain

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 50 Flour + 10 Sugar | Baking | 100 Rations | Ship Galley |
| 30 Flour + Water | Emergency Prep | 50 Hardtack | Any Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | High in isolated bases (1.8x), Normal in port cities (1.0x) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Port cities with milling facilities, industrial food processors
- **Major Consumers**: Naval vessels, submarine fleets, forward island bases
- **Bottlenecks**: Mill capacity, power shortages during air raids, transportation delays

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Flour is a processed necessity for naval operations. While less strategic than raw grain shipments, flour's compact storage and long shelf life make it essential for extended naval patrols. Submarines and destroyers on long-range missions depend on flour-based rations. Flour shortages don't threaten nations but do affect operational readiness and crew morale.
