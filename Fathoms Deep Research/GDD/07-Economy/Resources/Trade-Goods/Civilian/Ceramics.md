## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

High-quality ceramic goods including porcelain, pottery, and technical ceramics for insulation and laboratory equipment. Luxury trade goods with specialized military applications.

---

## Lore

Ceramics serve dual purposes in wartime - luxury goods for officers and technical materials for equipment. Japanese and Chinese porcelain remains highly valued despite war, with neutral merchants smuggling fine ceramics to wealthy buyers. More importantly, technical ceramics provide essential electrical insulation for ship systems, radio equipment, and laboratory apparatus. German scientists develop advanced ceramic insulators for radar systems. British research facilities need ceramic lab equipment that can withstand high temperatures. American naval officers prize Japanese ceramics as war trophies. Captured ceramic shipments fund resistance operations through black market sales.
