## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Roasted coffee beans from South America and the Pacific, the lifeblood of US Navy morale. American sailors run on coffee - watch changes, battle stations, and long patrols all require steady caffeine.

## Lore

Coffee is to the US Navy what tea is to the Royal Navy - absolutely non-negotiable. American destroyers brew coffee constantly, with fresh pots available 24/7. The smell of percolating coffee is the smell of an American warship. Brazil supplies most Allied coffee while Japan controls Indonesian plantations. Submarine crews consume enormous quantities during extended patrols. Coffee shortages cause immediate morale problems - tired sailors make fatal mistakes. German commerce raiders prioritize sinking coffee shipments to disrupt American naval operations. A US warship without coffee is like a tank without fuel.

Coffee is operationally critical for American naval forces. Sleep-deprived crews depend on caffeine to maintain alertness during combat operations. Night battles, extended watches, and patrol missions all require steady coffee supplies. Loss of coffee affects crew performance measurably. Unlike luxury goods, coffee is essential military infrastructure.
