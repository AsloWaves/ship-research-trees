## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and chewing tobacco for naval personnel. Essential morale supply - soldiers fight better with tobacco rations available.

## Lore

Tobacco is psychological ammunition. Every nation includes cigarettes in combat rations. American GIs share Lucky Strikes with allies. British sailors receive Navy Cut tobacco as standard issue. German soldiers prize captured American cigarettes above German brands. Japanese crews smoke constantly during tense operations. Submarine crews use tobacco to calm nerves during depth charge attacks. The iconic image of exhausted sailors smoking on deck after battle reflects tobacco's role in stress relief. Cigarettes serve as universal currency - trading tobacco gets you favors, information, and cooperation. Captured tobacco becomes valuable barter material. Running out of tobacco devastates morale faster than food shortages.
