## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Quality lumber for ship repairs, dock construction, and forward base building. Heavy but essential for emergency repairs and maintaining port facilities under combat conditions.

---

## Lore

Timber is strategic infrastructure material. Shipyards consume vast quantities building Liberty ships and repairing battle damage. Forward Pacific bases need timber for docks, warehouses, and defensive positions. Scandinavian timber is premium quality - German occupation of Norway secures valuable shipbuilding lumber. Canadian and American forests supply Allied construction efforts. Japanese control of Southeast Asian teak provides tropical hardwoods for their shipyards. Emergency repairs at sea often require spare timber - a destroyer with battle damage needs planking to patch holes above the waterline. British convoys carry timber for rebuilding bombed facilities.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Trading | Canada, Scandinavia, Southeast Asia | Medium | 20-30 units |
| Logging Operations | Forested coastal regions | Medium | 25-40 units |
| Salvage | Damaged facilities, wrecked ships | Medium | 15-25 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Emergency repair kits, construction materials, dock components
- **Construction**: Essential for all base construction, port repairs, defensive structures
- **Consumable**: Used directly for ship repairs (restores hull integrity)
- **Trade**: Moderate demand, heavy cargo with decent value

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 30 Timber | Milling | 50 Planking | Sawmill |
| 20 Timber | Construction | 1 Repair Kit | Shipyard |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~13 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | High in Pacific islands (2.0x), Low in forested regions (0.8x) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Canada, Norway, Finland, Southeast Asia, Pacific Northwest
- **Major Consumers**: Shipyards, forward base construction, emergency repair operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Transportation capacity, processing facilities, forest access

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Timber is infrastructure backbone for naval operations. Without steady timber supplies, damaged ships can't be repaired, new bases can't be built, and port facilities deteriorate. Control of timber-producing regions enables rapid base construction and maintenance. The Pacific island-hopping campaign absolutely requires timber for building forward bases on captured atolls.
