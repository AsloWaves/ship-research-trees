## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Advanced encryption and code-breaking machines including Enigma devices, cipher wheels, and cryptographic equipment. The most closely guarded secret weapons of naval intelligence.

---

## Lore

Cipher equipment represents the silent war fought beneath the surface of naval combat. The German Enigma machine encrypts U-boat wolf pack coordinates - until British code-breakers at Bletchley Park crack it. Japanese naval codes reveal carrier movements before Midway. American SIGABA machines protect fleet communications from enemy intelligence. Every major naval power guards cipher equipment with fanatical security - capture of a single Enigma machine triggers desperate recovery operations. Submarines sacrifice themselves rather than let cipher equipment fall into enemy hands. Allied convoy routing depends on reading German U-boat signals. Intelligence agencies pay fortunes for captured enemy cipher machines. The Battle of the Atlantic is won not just with depth charges, but with code-breaking. Those who read enemy signals control the seas; those whose codes are broken lose fleets to invisible enemies.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Capture Operations | Enemy ships, submarines | Extreme | 1 unit |
| Intelligence Raids | Code-breaking facilities | Extreme | 1-2 units |
| Black Market | Traitors, defectors | Extreme | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Intelligence systems, secure communications, code-breaking stations
- **Construction**: Signals intelligence facilities, encrypted command centers
- **Consumable**: Decrypt enemy communications (reveals enemy positions/plans temporarily)
- **Trade**: Priceless to intelligence agencies, extreme black market value

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 Cipher Equipment + 3 Research Data | Cryptanalysis | Intelligence Report (enemy fleet movements) | Intelligence Center |
| - | - | - | - |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1916 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | 10-20x depending on cipher type and intelligence value |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Captured enemy equipment, intelligence operations
- **Major Consumers**: Naval intelligence, code-breaking operations, fleet commands
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme security, destroy-before-capture protocols, rarity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Cipher equipment determines who wins the intelligence war. Breaking enemy codes allows anticipating fleet movements, ambushing convoys, and avoiding submarine wolf packs. The capture of U-559's Enigma machine helps crack German naval codes, changing the Battle of the Atlantic. Japanese cipher machines captured at various actions reveal carrier movements before critical battles. Intelligence from cipher-breaking saves thousands of lives and countless ships. Nations will sacrifice entire operations to protect or capture cipher equipment. The invisible war of code-making and code-breaking determines who controls the information that wins naval battles.
