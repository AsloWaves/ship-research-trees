## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Critical pharmaceutical supplies including sulfa drugs, morphine, quinine, and penicillin. Life-saving medicines that determine whether wounded sailors live or die.

---

## Lore

Rare medicines are the difference between life and death for wounded crews. Penicillin - the miracle drug - prevents infection and saves lives that would otherwise be lost to gangrene. Sulfa drugs treat battlefield wounds. Morphine eases unbearable pain. Quinine prevents malaria in tropical theaters where disease kills more than combat. Allied production of penicillin is strictly controlled - Axis forces desperately seek captured stocks. Ships operating far from supply bases hoard medical supplies like gold. A destroyer without adequate medicines faces agonizing choices when sailors are wounded. Tropical operations without quinine see entire crews incapacitated by malaria. Japanese blockade creates severe medical shortages - garrison forces suffer horrific disease rates. Smart captains stockpile medicines knowing that crew health determines combat effectiveness. A healthy crew fights; a sick crew dies.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Supply Convoys | Medical supply depots | Medium | 8-12 units |
| Pharmaceutical Trade | Neutral nations, black market | High | 6-10 units |
| Captured Stocks | Enemy medical facilities | High | 5-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Advanced medical kits, field hospital supplies
- **Construction**: Sickbays, field hospitals, medical stations
- **Consumable**: Emergency medical treatment (heals wounded crew, prevents disease)
- **Trade**: High value in disease-prone tropical theaters

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 10 Rare Medicines + 5 Medical Supplies | Preparation | 20 Advanced Medical Kits | Medical Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~157 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | 3-4x higher in tropical theaters, 2x in blockaded areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (penicillin), Switzerland (pharmaceuticals), United Kingdom
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces, tropical garrisons, field hospitals
- **Bottlenecks**: Penicillin production limits, blockades, pharmaceutical manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Rare medicines determine crew survival and combat readiness. Penicillin gives Allied forces massive advantage - wounded sailors who would die survive to fight again. Malaria in Pacific theater incapacitates more forces than combat - quinine supply is critical. Japanese blockade creates medical crisis; garrison forces suffer devastating disease rates without adequate medicines. A ship with good medical supplies maintains crew health and morale; one without faces declining effectiveness. Medical superiority translates directly to sustained combat capability. Healthy crews win extended campaigns; sick crews collapse.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Abundant | 1.0x | Penicillin production, pharmaceutical industry |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | 1.5x | Good medical production, penicillin access |
| Japan | Scarce | 3.0x | Blockade creates severe shortages |
| Germany | Moderate | 1.8x | No penicillin access, limited alternatives |
