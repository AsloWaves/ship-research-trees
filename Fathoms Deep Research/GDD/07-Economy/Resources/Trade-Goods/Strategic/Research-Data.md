## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Top-secret research documentation on advanced weapons, propulsion systems, radar technology, and nuclear programs. Intelligence so valuable that nations execute entire operations to obtain or destroy it.

---

## Lore

Research data represents the accumulated knowledge of secret weapons programs. Documents on German rocket development, Japanese long-range submarine designs, Allied atomic research, radar improvements, and advanced torpedo guidance systems. Every navy desperately pursues enemy research while protecting their own. Captured documents on proximity fuses revolutionize anti-aircraft warfare. Japanese research on high-speed submarines influences Allied designs. German acoustic torpedo data enables countermeasure development. Intelligence services pay fortunes for stolen research - a single document can save years of development. Scientists and defectors smuggle research data across enemy lines. Ships carrying research documentation have orders to destroy files before capture - scuttling charges set specifically for document safes. The technology race is won by those who steal effectively and protect ruthlessly. One researcher with the right documents is worth more than an armored division.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Espionage Operations | Enemy research facilities | Extreme | 1-2 units |
| Captured Intelligence | Seized laboratories, defeated research ships | Very High | 1-3 units |
| Defector Intelligence | Scientists, researchers | Extreme | 1-2 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Technology unlocks, advanced weapon systems, prototype development
- **Construction**: Enables advanced facility construction, secret weapon programs
- **Consumable**: Research acceleration (massive reduction in development time)
- **Trade**: Priceless - intelligence agencies only, never open market

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 3 Research Data + 5 Blueprints | Analysis & Development | 1 Advanced Technology Unlock | Research Laboratory |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1683 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | Not tradeable - intelligence assets only, value beyond measure |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Secret research programs, espionage agencies, captured facilities
- **Major Consumers**: Military research departments, intelligence services, development programs
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme security, counter-intelligence, destroy-before-capture protocols

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Research data is the ultimate strategic commodity. German V-weapon research reveals rocket technology. Japanese I-400 submarine carrier designs influence post-war naval aviation. Allied proximity fuse data revolutionizes anti-aircraft warfare. Atomic research documents are so critical that entire covert operations exist solely to protect or steal them. A single research document can eliminate years of development and billions in research costs. Nations will sacrifice major assets to protect or acquire critical research data. The war is won by those who innovate first - and research data determines who leads the technology race.
