## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Radioactive uranium ore - the rarest and most valuable strategic material in existence. Foundation of the Manhattan Project and key to ultimate weapons research.

---

## Lore

Uranium is the most closely guarded secret of World War II. Belgian Congo uranium stocks become prize sought by all intelligence services. German scientists race to unlock atomic secrets while Allied spies sabotage Norwegian heavy water plants. American submarines quietly transport uranium samples to Los Alamos. Soviet agents infiltrate Manhattan Project seeking uranium processing secrets. A single kilogram of enriched uranium represents years of research and billions of dollars. Only the highest levels of government know uranium's true purpose. Neutral merchants who discover uranium cargo find themselves targeted by every intelligence agency. Uranium is literally world-changing material - whoever controls it controls the future.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~7500 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Not market-traded |
| **Regional Variance** | Governments control all supplies |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Belgian Congo, Canada, limited other sources
- **Major Consumers**: Manhattan Project, Axis atomic research programs
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme rarity, government control, intelligence interdiction

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: LEGENDARY
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Uranium transcends normal strategic value. It is the foundation of atomic weapons research. Control of uranium supplies determines who develops nuclear capability first. Intelligence services from all nations actively hunt uranium shipments. A player possessing uranium becomes immediate target for theft, espionage, and government seizure. The most valuable substance in the game world.
