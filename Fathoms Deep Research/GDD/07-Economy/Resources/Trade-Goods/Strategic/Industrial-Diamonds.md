## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Ultra-hard industrial diamonds essential for precision cutting, drilling armor plate, and manufacturing high-tolerance weapons components. Worth more than their weight in gold to military industry.

## Lore

Industrial diamonds are the hidden foundation of precision manufacturing. Every armor-piercing shell, every precision-bored gun barrel, every high-tolerance ball bearing requires diamond tooling. Natural sources in Africa and South America make diamond supply a geopolitical battleground. Germany's shortage of industrial diamonds cripples precision manufacturing - forcing reliance on smuggled stones or inferior substitutes. Allied control of African diamond mines becomes strategic leverage. Submarines risk blockades to smuggle compact, invaluable diamond shipments. A single crate of industrial diamonds enables production of thousands of precision parts. Japanese industry desperately seeks diamonds as blockades tighten. Neutral Swiss dealers profit enormously from clandestine diamond trade. Without industrial diamonds, nations cannot produce modern weapons at scale - making these tiny stones as strategically vital as oil or steel.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Smuggling | Neutral ports, African sources | Very High | 3-5 units |
| Black Market | Swiss dealers, diamond traders | Extreme | 2-4 units |
| Convoy Raids | Enemy supply ships | Very High | 3-6 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Precision Tools, cutting dies, drill bits, grinding wheels
- **Construction**: Machine shops, precision manufacturing facilities, armament factories
- **Consumable**: Emergency tooling (enables field manufacturing of critical parts)
- **Trade**: Extremely high value, compact smuggling cargo

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 5 Industrial Diamonds + 10 Steel | Toolmaking | 20 Precision Tools | Machine Shop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1050 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Extreme |
| **Regional Variance** | 4-6x higher in Axis territories, 2x in neutral zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: South Africa, Belgian Congo, Brazil (Allied-controlled)
- **Major Consumers**: All military industries, precision manufacturing, armament production
- **Bottlenecks**: Allied control of sources, smuggling routes, synthetic production limits

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Industrial diamonds are absolutely critical to precision manufacturing. Without them, producing modern weapons becomes impossible. Allied control of African diamond sources creates severe Axis disadvantage. Germany attempts synthetic diamond production but cannot match natural supply. Japanese blockade isolation makes diamond shortage catastrophic - precision manufacturing collapses. Submarines smuggling diamonds are more valuable than gold shipments. A nation's industrial diamond supply directly determines its ability to produce high-quality weapons. The diamond war is fought in shadows, but its impact shapes the entire conflict.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Moderate | 1.5x | Allied control of sources |
| United Kingdom | Moderate | 1.3x | Direct African supply |
| Japan | Extremely Scarce | 5.0x | Blockaded from all sources |
| Germany | Very Scarce | 3.5x | Smuggling only, synthetic substitutes |
