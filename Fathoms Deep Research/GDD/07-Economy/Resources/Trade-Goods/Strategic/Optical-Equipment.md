## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

High-precision optical components including rangefinder lenses, periscope optics, binoculars, and fire control telescopes. Essential for accurate naval gunnery and submarine operations.

## Lore

Naval warfare depends on seeing the enemy first and hitting them accurately. Precision optical equipment - rangefinders, fire control optics, submarine periscopes, anti-aircraft directors - determines who wins engagements. German Zeiss and Japanese Nikko optics are world-renowned for superior quality. Allied bombing of German optical factories creates severe shortages. Submarine periscope optics are irreplaceable at sea - damage means mission abort. Battleship rangefinders with damaged optics cannot engage at maximum range. Japanese destroyers rely on exceptional night optics for torpedo attacks. Captured German rangefinders are analyzed to improve Allied fire control. A cruiser with degraded optics loses every gunnery duel. Smart captains stockpile spare optical components, knowing that broken lenses mean blind ships. The clarity of your optics often determines whether you see the enemy torpedo bomber before it's too late.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Supply Convoys | Naval arsenals | High | 6-10 units |
| Salvage Operations | Damaged ships, captured vessels | High | 4-8 units |
| Black Market | Neutral ports, Swiss dealers | Very High | 5-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Rangefinders, fire control systems, periscope assemblies
- **Construction**: Fire control directors, observation stations, submarine periscopes
- **Consumable**: Emergency optical repairs (restores targeting accuracy)
- **Trade**: High value to gunnery-focused factions, critical for submarines

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 10 Optical Equipment + 5 Precision Tools | Assembly | 3 Advanced Rangefinders | Optical Workshop |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~180 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | 2x higher after optical factory bombing, 1.5x in remote theaters |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss), Japan (Nikko), United States (growing), United Kingdom
- **Major Consumers**: Surface combatants, submarines, coastal artillery, carriers
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision glass manufacturing, skilled optical grinding, factory bombing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Optical equipment determines naval engagement effectiveness. Ships with superior optics hit first and hit accurately. Submarines with damaged periscope optics cannot operate safely. Allied bombing of Zeiss factories creates German optical crisis. Japanese night-fighting optics give destroyer squadrons crucial advantage in close actions. Degraded rangefinder optics reduce battleship main battery effectiveness by 50% or more. A fleet with optical superiority dominates engagements through superior targeting and detection. The difference between premium and inferior optics often decides who survives the battle.
