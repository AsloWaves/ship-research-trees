## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Enemy naval charts showing operational areas, preferred routes, rendezvous points, and navigational hazards. Reveals enemy navigation patterns and operational zones.

---

## Lore

Navigation maps captured from enemy vessels reveal how they perceive and operate in their theater - marked routes, danger zones, rendezvous points, refueling locations, and navigational notes accumulated through operational experience. These maps differ from standard charts by showing human intelligence: "Frequent Allied patrols noted here" or "Safe anchorage for emergency repairs." During WW2, captured Japanese maps revealed their preferred transit routes through Pacific atolls, while German U-boat charts showed safe zones and convoy interception points. The maps provide insight into enemy operational patterns and can reveal locations of hidden bases, refueling points, or patrol areas. For players, these maps unlock navigation bonuses in specific regions and reveal strategic locations. Unlike minefield charts focused on hazards or harbor plans focused on facilities, navigation maps show the operational geography from the enemy's perspective - where they go, where they avoid, and why.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Captured from enemy vessels | Any enemy warship | Low | 1-3 |
| Salvage operations | Sunken ships | Medium | 1-2 |
| Harbor raids | Navigation offices | Medium | 3-5 |
| Prize captures | Merchant vessels | Low | 1-2 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Minefield Charts for Safe Passage Routes
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Study to unlock navigation bonuses in specific regions
- **Trade**: Moderate demand from fleet navigators and operational planners

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Navigation Maps (3) | Cartographic Analysis | Regional Navigation Charts | Navigation Office |
| Navigation Maps (1) + Minefield Charts (1) | Combined Analysis | Safe Passage Routes | Intelligence Center |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~230 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher in unfamiliar or contested waters |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy navies (captured materials)
- **Major Consumers**: Fleet navigators, submarine commanders, convoy planners
- **Bottlenecks**: Common availability, regional specificity limits universal value

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Navigation maps provide operational intelligence about enemy movement patterns and preferred areas. Players who study maps gain navigation bonuses in specific regions - faster transit, reduced fuel consumption, avoiding hazards the enemy has already marked. Maps also reveal potential ambush points and safe anchorages. Uncommon rarity reflects widespread availability - most warships carry navigation charts - but regional specificity limits universal application. A map of the Solomon Islands won't help in the Atlantic.
