## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Intercepted enemy radio transmissions in encrypted form, captured by listening stations and direction-finding equipment. Valuable raw intelligence that becomes actionable when decrypted using Enemy Code Books.

---

## Lore

The constant hum of enemy radio traffic - encrypted messages bouncing across the ether, waiting to be plucked from the air by Allied listening stations. Radio intercepts are the raw material of signals intelligence (SIGINT), encrypted communications captured but not yet decoded. Stations at places like Station HYPO in Pearl Harbor and Bletchley Park's Y-stations collected thousands of intercepts daily, cataloging enemy callsigns, frequencies, and transmission patterns. Even without decryption, traffic analysis reveals valuable intelligence - increased radio activity suggests pending operations, changes in callsign patterns indicate unit movements, and transmission locations (via direction-finding) show fleet positions. When paired with captured code books, intercepts become decoded messages revealing enemy intentions. The intercepts span submarine position reports, convoy sailing orders, weather observations, and fleet operational commands. Collecting intercepts is relatively easy - any radio receiver can capture transmissions - but their value multiplies exponentially when code books are available for decryption.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Radio listening stations | Allied monitoring facilities | Low | 5-10 |
| Shipboard intercept | Radio-equipped vessels | Low | 1-3 |
| Direction-finding operations | DF stations | Medium | 3-5 |
| Mission rewards | Intelligence gathering missions | Low | 2-5 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Enemy Code Books to create Decoded Messages
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Limited use without code books - traffic analysis only
- **Trade**: Moderate demand from cryptanalysis centers

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Radio Intercepts (10) + Enemy Code Books (1) | Decryption | Decoded Messages (50-100) | Intelligence Center Lv3+ |
| Radio Intercepts (20) | Traffic Analysis | Enemy Fleet Positions (approximate) | Signals Intelligence Office |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1515 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (steady supply) |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher near active combat zones with heavy radio traffic |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Allied signals intelligence stations, monitoring vessels
- **Major Consumers**: Cryptanalysis centers, intelligence headquarters
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires Enemy Code Books to unlock full value, time-sensitive

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Radio intercepts are the foundation of signals intelligence but require code books to realize their full potential. On their own, they provide limited intelligence through traffic analysis - identifying active enemy units and approximate locations. Their true value emerges when combined with code books for decryption. The Rare rarity reflects moderate availability - intercepts are constantly collected but only useful players with decryption capabilities want them in volume. Stack limit of 5 represents manageable batches for processing.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | Normal | OP-20-G constantly collects Japanese traffic |
| United Kingdom | Common | Normal | Y-stations intercept German/Japanese signals |
| Japan | Common (own) | -50% | Allied intercepts available but less useful |
| Germany | Common (own) | -50% | Allied intercepts available but less useful |
