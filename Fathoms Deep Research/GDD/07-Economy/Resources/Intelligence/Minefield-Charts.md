## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Detailed charts showing the exact locations and types of naval mines in enemy-controlled waters. Essential for safe navigation through mined straits, harbor approaches, and defensive perimeters.

## Lore

One of the most critical naval intelligence documents - minefield charts literally mean the difference between safe passage and catastrophic loss. During WW2, minefields protected major harbors, choke points, and convoy routes, with thousands of mines laid in defensive patterns. These charts, captured from enemy minelayers or harbor authorities, show mine types (contact, magnetic, acoustic), depths, pattern spacing, and safe channels. Without them, approaching enemy-held waters is suicidal. The Japanese heavily mined approaches to Truk and Singapore, while the Germans created vast defensive minefields in the North Sea and Baltic. Mine warfare claimed more ships than any other single weapon system, making these charts invaluable for offensive operations, submarine penetrations, and commando raids. Charts become outdated as mines drift or new ones are laid, creating a constant demand for updated intelligence.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Captured from minelayers | Enemy mine-laying vessels | Very High | 1 |
| Harbor raids | Enemy port facilities | Extreme | 1-2 |
| Espionage missions | Coastal fortifications | High | 1 |
| Salvaged documents | Sunken enemy vessels | High | 1 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Navigation Maps to create Safe Passage Routes
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Consume to permanently mark safe channels on player's navigation map for specific region
- **Trade**: Extremely high demand from invasion planners and submarine commanders

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Minefield Charts (1) + Navigation Maps (1) | Chart Analysis | Safe Passage Routes | Navigation Office |
| Minefield Charts (3) | Mine Warfare Planning | Minesweeper Mission Packages | Naval Operations |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5100 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High (value depends on operational relevance) |
| **Regional Variance** | Premium prices near invasion zones, heavily mined waters |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy mine warfare units (must be captured)
- **Major Consumers**: Amphibious assault planners, submarine commanders, minesweeper units
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme capture difficulty, enemy destroys charts before capture, outdated quickly

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Minefield charts are critical force multipliers for offensive naval operations. Possession of accurate charts allows players to navigate hazardous waters without minesweeper support, approach enemy bases via "back door" routes, and plan submarine infiltrations through defensive perimeters. The charts unlock new navigation routes in previously inaccessible areas and reduce the risk of catastrophic mine strikes. Epic rarity reflects the extreme danger in obtaining these documents and their operational importance - a single chart might enable an entire amphibious landing by revealing the safe approach channel.
