## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Captured cipher materials from enemy naval operations, including Enigma rotors, JN-25 code sheets, and Purple machine documentation. Grants unprecedented access to enemy communications when delivered to Allied cryptanalysis centers.

## Lore

The most valuable intelligence prize of the war - actual enemy cipher materials captured from disabled submarines, boarding actions, or covert operations. The Allies' capture of German Enigma machines from U-559 and U-110, along with Japanese JN-25 codebooks from cargo vessels, provided the foundation for the Ultra and Magic programs that changed the course of the war. Every code book represents years of enemy cryptographic work and potentially saves thousands of Allied lives by revealing convoy routes, submarine positions, and fleet movements. The rarity reflects the extraordinary difficulty of capturing these materials intact - most enemy crews are trained to destroy them before capture. Intelligence agencies will pay almost any price for fresh code materials, as ciphers are regularly updated and old books quickly lose value.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Boarding Actions | Enemy submarines/vessels | Extreme | 1 |
| Salvage Operations | Sunken vessels (shallow) | Very High | 1 |
| Covert Raids | Enemy installations | Extreme | 1 |
| Special Missions | Story-driven events | High | 1 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Cannot be crafted - only obtained through capture
- **Construction**: Required for Intelligence Center upgrades
- **Consumable**: Deliver to Naval Intelligence for massive reputation gains and permanent decryption bonuses
- **Trade**: Extremely high black market value, but illegal to sell in most ports

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Enemy Code Books (1) | Cryptanalysis | Decoded Messages (50-100) | Intelligence Center Lv3+ |
| Enemy Code Books (1) | Intelligence Analysis | Permanent faction decryption bonus | Naval Command |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~15300 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | 5x higher at Naval Intelligence HQ, not accepted at most ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy navies (must be captured, not produced)
- **Major Consumers**: Allied Naval Intelligence, cryptanalysis centers
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme rarity, enemy destruction protocols, time-sensitive value

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The single most strategically important intelligence item in the game. Possession of enemy code books provides theater-wide advantages: reveals enemy positions on tactical maps, grants advance warning of attacks, improves mission success rates, and unlocks special operations. Historically accurate to the immense value placed on captured Enigma machines and Japanese cipher materials. Players who successfully deliver code books gain permanent standing with intelligence factions and unlock advanced espionage missions. The extreme rarity and single-item stack limit reflect the historical scarcity and importance of such captures.
