## Lore

Ship recognition cards were ubiquitous training materials in WW2 navies, distributed to every vessel and lookout post. These pocket-sized cards displayed silhouettes, profile drawings, and key identifying features (funnel configuration, mast arrangement, turret placement) of enemy vessels. Quick identification meant the difference between engaging a destroyer versus a battleship, or recognizing a Q-ship disguised as a merchantman. The cards organized ships by class, showing subtle differences between sister ships and successive designs. Both sides constantly updated cards as new vessels entered service or old ones were modified. For players, ship recognition cards serve as a learning tool and buff - studying cards improves identification speed and accuracy in combat, revealing enemy ship classes faster and more reliably. The cards also help with photo interpretation and convoy manifest analysis. Their Common rarity reflects mass production - every sailor carried these cards - while the large stack limit (20) represents the comprehensive sets covering hundreds of ship types across all navies.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~38 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low (standardized training material) |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - widely available everywhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Naval intelligence printing offices, all major navies
- **Major Consumers**: Training facilities, new crew members, lookout personnel

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐

Ship recognition cards provide foundational knowledge for naval operations. Players who invest time studying comprehensive card sets gain permanent improvements to ship identification systems - faster target classification, more accurate threat assessment, better tactical information in combat. The gameplay value comes from accumulation and study rather than individual card importance. Common rarity and low value reflect ubiquitous availability, while large stack limit encourages collecting complete sets for maximum benefit.
