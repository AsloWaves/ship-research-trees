## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Decrypted enemy communications from Ultra and Magic intelligence programs revealing fleet movements, convoy routes, and operational orders. Time-sensitive intelligence that provides tactical advantages when acted upon quickly.

---

## Lore

The fruits of Allied cryptanalysis efforts - intercepted enemy communications broken by Bletchley Park's Ultra program or the US Navy's OP-20-G Magic operations. These messages reveal enemy intentions hours or days before execution, allowing commanders to position forces advantageously or avoid ambushes. Messages contain operational details like "Convoy departing Truk 0600 hours" or "Submarine wolfpack forming grid square AJ-47." The intelligence value degrades rapidly as enemy plans are executed or changed, making these messages valuable but time-limited assets. Possession of decoded messages without proper security clearance is highly illegal, and their distribution is carefully controlled by intelligence officers.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Intelligence Center Processing | Allied intelligence facilities | Medium | 3-10 |
| Cryptanalysis | Processing Enemy Code Books + Radio Intercepts | High | 50-100 |
| Mission Rewards | Special intelligence operations | Medium | 1-3 |
| Black Market | Major ports (illegal) | Low | 1-2 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Used to create Mission Intelligence Packages
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Consume to reveal enemy positions/movements on tactical map (24hr duration)
- **Trade**: High demand from fleet commanders, illegal to sell publicly

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Radio Intercepts (10) + Enemy Code Books (1) | Decryption | Decoded Messages (50-100) | Intelligence Center Lv3+ |
| Decoded Messages (5) | Intelligence Analysis | Tactical Map Update | Command Center |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5050 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High (degrades with time) |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher near active combat zones, lower at rear-area ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Allied intelligence facilities (Bletchley Park, OP-20-G)
- **Major Consumers**: Fleet commanders, convoy escorts, submarine hunters
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires Enemy Code Books to produce, time-decay reduces value

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Decoded messages represent actionable intelligence - the difference between ambushing an enemy convoy and sailing into a trap. Players who consume these messages gain temporary tactical advantages: marked enemy positions, advance warning of attacks, optimal convoy interception points. Historically, Ultra intelligence allowed the Allies to route convoys around U-boat wolfpacks and position carrier groups for decisive battles. The Epic rarity and time-decay mechanic reflect the reality that intelligence has a shelf-life - today's decoded message is tomorrow's outdated information.
