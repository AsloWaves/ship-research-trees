## Lore

Technical manuals are the operational bibles of naval warfare - detailed guides showing how enemy ships, weapons, and systems function. Captured from enemy vessels, training facilities, or technical libraries, these manuals reveal fire control procedures, radar capabilities, torpedo specifications, engine limitations, armor layouts, and damage control protocols. During WW2, captured Japanese manuals on the Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo revealed its exceptional range and oxygen propulsion system, while German U-boat manuals detailed schnorkel operations and diving procedures. This intelligence allows Allied forces to exploit weaknesses - knowing that a particular radar has a  minimum range blind spot, or that specific engine configurations reduce top speed. Manuals also support reverse-engineering efforts, helping engineers understand enemy innovations. For players, technical manuals unlock detailed information about enemy vessels encountered in combat, revealing optimal engagement ranges, vulnerable systems, and tactical limitations. The heavier weight (0.03t) reflects the substantial nature of these bound technical volumes.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Captured from enemy vessels | Disabled/surrendered warships | High | 1-2 |
| Training facility raids | Enemy naval academies | Very High | 2-3 |
| Salvage operations | Sunken vessels | Medium | 1 |
| Espionage | Technical libraries | High | 1 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Used in Research & Development projects
- **Construction**: Unlocks reverse-engineered enemy technology
- **Consumable**: Study to unlock detailed enemy ship information in combat UI
- **Trade**: High demand from naval intelligence and R&D departments

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Technical Manuals (3) | Technical Analysis | Enemy Weakness Reports | Research Laboratory |
| Technical Manuals (5) | Reverse Engineering | Technology Blueprints | R&D Facility Lv2+ |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1545 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (long-term value) |
| **Regional Variance** | Premium at R&D facilities and naval intelligence centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy navies (captured materials)
- **Major Consumers**: Naval intelligence, R&D departments, tactical analysts
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires successful captures, language translation needs

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Technical manuals provide lasting strategic advantages by revealing enemy capabilities and weaknesses. Unlike time-sensitive intelligence like patrol schedules, technical information remains relevant throughout the war. Players who study manuals gain permanent combat advantages - UI displays showing enemy weak points, optimal engagement ranges, and system vulnerabilities. Manuals also enable technology development through reverse engineering. Rare rarity reflects capture difficulty and the specialized value to technical audiences rather than front-line commanders.
