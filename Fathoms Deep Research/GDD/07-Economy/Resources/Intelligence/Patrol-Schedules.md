## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Enemy naval patrol timetables showing destroyer routes, anti-submarine sweeps, convoy escort assignments, and picket schedules. Reveals gaps in enemy coverage that can be exploited for safe passage or surprise attacks.

## Lore

Patrol schedules are the operational heartbeat of naval defense - documents showing when and where warships patrol, creating either safety or vulnerability depending on who holds them. These schedules detail destroyer patrol patterns, submarine hunting zones, convoy escort rotations, and picket line timing. Knowledge of enemy patrol schedules allows submarines to slip through defensive screens, raiders to strike when escorts change shifts, and supply runners to exploit coverage gaps. During the war, regular patrol patterns became predictable, and intelligence on these patterns enabled successful penetrations of defended waters. A schedule showing "Destroyer patrol Delta-7 returns to base 1800-2200 hours for refueling" creates a four-hour window of opportunity. The schedules also reveal force dispositions and operational priorities - heavily patrolled areas indicate important assets or perceived threats. Like all intelligence, patrol schedules have limited lifespans as navies rotate assignments and adjust patterns when compromised.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Captured from patrol vessels | Enemy destroyers/corvettes | High | 1 |
| Decoded signals | Radio intercepts + code books | Medium | 1-2 |
| Harbor espionage | Naval operations centers | Very High | 2-3 |
| Defector intelligence | Turned enemy personnel | Medium | 1 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Convoy Manifests to create Intercept Plans
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Use to reveal enemy patrol patterns and safe transit windows for 5 days
- **Trade**: Extremely high demand from submarine commanders and blockade runners

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Patrol Schedules (2) + Convoy Manifests (3) | Tactical Analysis | Convoy Intercept Plans | Intelligence Office |
| Patrol Schedules (3) | Pattern Analysis | Safe Transit Routes | Navigation Office |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2525 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High (degrades rapidly as patterns change) |
| **Regional Variance** | Premium in heavily patrolled waters and blockade zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy naval operations (captured/intercepted)
- **Major Consumers**: Submarine forces, blockade runners, supply convoys
- **Bottlenecks**: Time-sensitive information, patterns change weekly, requires fresh intelligence

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Patrol schedules are essential intelligence for both offensive and defensive operations. Submarines use them to penetrate defended harbors, surface raiders time attacks for minimal escort presence, and supply vessels plan runs through blockaded waters. Players possessing current schedules gain timed objectives - windows of opportunity when specific zones are lightly defended. The Rare rarity and rapid degradation mechanic reflect the constant cat-and-mouse nature of patrol warfare - schedules are valuable but quickly outdated as navies adapt to security breaches.
