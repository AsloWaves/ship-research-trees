## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Meteorological forecasts and observations covering operational areas, including sea states, visibility, storm tracks, and atmospheric conditions. Critical for planning naval operations and timing strikes for optimal conditions.

## Lore

Weather intelligence was critically important in naval warfare - storms could scatter fleets, fog could hide movements, clear skies exposed carriers to air attack. Both sides maintained extensive meteorological services, collecting data from weather stations, ships at sea, reconnaissance flights, and even submarines. The famous D-Day invasion hinged on weather forecasting, while the "Divine Wind" typhoons of 1944 devastated the US Third Fleet. Weather reports show predicted conditions for operational areas: wind speed and direction, sea state, cloud cover, visibility, storm tracks, and frontal systems. Accurate forecasts allowed commanders to time operations advantageously - launching strikes before weather closed in, using storms for concealment, or avoiding heavy seas that would damage smaller vessels. For players, weather reports provide operational planning tools - revealing optimal windows for carrier operations, submarine transits, or convoy runs. The short validity (24-48 hours) reflects the rapidly changing nature of meteorological conditions at sea.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Meteorological services | Allied weather stations | Very Low | 5-10 |
| Fleet weather offices | Naval bases | Very Low | 3-5 |
| Reconnaissance reports | Weather observation flights | Low | 2-4 |
| Subscription service | Any major port | Very Low | 1-3 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with other intelligence for optimal mission timing
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Study to reveal weather forecasts for operational planning (24-48hr validity)
- **Trade**: Steady demand from all naval operations

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Weather Reports (5) | Meteorological Analysis | Extended Range Forecast | Weather Office |
| Weather Reports (3) + Patrol Schedules (2) | Tactical Planning | Optimal Strike Windows | Operations Planning |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~227 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low (routine service) |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - standardized forecasting service |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Naval meteorological services, weather stations
- **Major Consumers**: All naval operations - universal demand
- **Bottlenecks**: None - continuously produced, but rapidly becomes outdated

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐

Weather reports are fundamental operational intelligence used by everyone. Players use forecasts to optimize mission timing - launching carrier strikes in clear weather, using storms to hide convoy movements, avoiding heavy seas in small craft. The reports also affect gameplay directly through weather systems that impact visibility, sea state, and operational effectiveness. Common rarity reflects continuous production and universal access, while moderate value reflects utility rather than competitive advantage - everyone has weather reports, but smart use creates advantages.
