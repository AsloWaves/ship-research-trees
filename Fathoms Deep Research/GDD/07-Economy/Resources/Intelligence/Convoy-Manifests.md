## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Complete cargo manifests from enemy merchant convoys detailing ship composition, cargo contents, routes, and schedules. Invaluable for targeting high-value shipments and planning convoy raids.

## Lore

Every convoy carries manifests listing ships, cargo types, destinations, and escort details - critical logistics documents that become intelligence gold mines when captured. These manifests reveal which convoys carry vital war materials (aviation fuel, ammunition, steel) versus low-priority goods, allowing attackers to prioritize targets. A manifest showing "12,000 tons aviation gasoline, Truk to Rabaul, escort: 2 destroyers" tells a submarine commander everything needed for a successful interception. During the Pacific War, captured manifests helped the US Navy identify and sink tankers carrying vital oil to Japan, crippling their war effort. Manifests also reveal patterns in convoy organization, escort strength, and routing that can be exploited. Unlike decoded messages, manifests provide solid documentary evidence rather than intercepted communications, making them reliable intelligence sources.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Captured from merchants | Enemy cargo vessels | Medium | 1-2 |
| Harbor raids | Port administrative offices | High | 2-5 |
| Submarine captures | Stopped convoy vessels | High | 1 |
| Espionage | Enemy shipping offices | Medium | 1-3 |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Patrol Schedules to create Convoy Intercept Plans
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Use to reveal high-value convoy routes and cargos for 7 days
- **Trade**: High demand from submarine commanders and commerce raiders

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Convoy Manifests (3) + Patrol Schedules (2) | Intelligence Analysis | Convoy Intercept Plans | Intelligence Office |
| Convoy Manifests (5) | Pattern Analysis | Enemy Logistics Report | Naval Command |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1515 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Higher value in active submarine warfare zones |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Enemy merchant marine (captured documents)
- **Major Consumers**: Submarine forces, surface raiders, convoy interdiction planners
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires successful ship captures, time-sensitive information

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Convoy manifests enable players to conduct efficient commerce warfare by identifying high-value targets and avoiding heavily-defended low-priority convoys. A player with current manifests can focus on tankers carrying fuel or freighters loaded with aircraft rather than wasting torpedoes on empty ships or low-value cargos. Manifests also reveal enemy supply chains and logistics vulnerabilities. The Rare rarity reflects moderate acquisition difficulty - manifests are found on many merchant vessels but must be captured quickly before crews destroy them.
