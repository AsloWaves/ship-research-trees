## Description

> *Carbon composition resistors for controlling current flow. Essential components in every electronic circuit.*

## Lore

Resistors are the traffic controllers of electronic circuits. They limit current, divide voltage, and set operating points for tubes and other components. Without the right resistors, circuits either starve for power or burn out from excess. Every radio, every fire control computer, every electronic device contains dozens of these humble components.

Color bands painted on each resistor encode its value - a language that electronics technicians learn to read at a glance. In the heat of combat repairs, there's no time to measure each component. A technician must grab the right resistor instantly, knowing from its stripes exactly what it will do in the circuit.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Electronics Workshop | Easy | 25 per batch |
| Purchase | Industrial ports | Easy | Standard price |
| Salvage | Electronic equipment | Easy | 5-15 units |
| Trade | Any supplier | Easy | Abundant |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: All electronic circuits, repair kits
- **Construction**: Electronic system installation
- **Consumable**: ✅ Replacement for damaged circuits
- **Trade**: Low value but universal need

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Carbon ×1 + Copper Wire ×1 | Manufacturing | Resistors ×20 | Electronics Workshop |
| Resistors ×10 + Capacitors ×10 | Assembly | Circuit Board ×1 | Electronics Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal variation |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All industrial nations
- **Major Consumers**: Electronics manufacturers, repair facilities
- **Bottlenecks**: None - simple to manufacture

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Common but necessary
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (1/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Resistors are so common they're almost taken for granted. Their strategic value lies in quantity - a ship might need hundreds for a major electronics repair. Running out during combat repairs can be catastrophic.
