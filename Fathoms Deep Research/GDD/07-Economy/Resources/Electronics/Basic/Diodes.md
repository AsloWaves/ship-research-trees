## Description

> *One-way electrical valves using vacuum or crystal technology. Essential for power conversion and signal processing.*

## Lore

Diodes allow current to flow in only one direction - a simple property with profound applications. They convert alternating current to direct current, protect circuits from reverse polarity, and detect radio signals. Without diodes, most electronic equipment would be impossible.

Two technologies compete in this era: vacuum tube diodes and the newer crystal diodes. Tube diodes are robust but bulky and power-hungry. Crystal diodes are compact and efficient but temperamental and easily damaged. Both have their place in naval electronics, and technicians must understand both.
