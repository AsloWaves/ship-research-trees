## Description

> *Electromagnetic devices for voltage conversion. Essential for power distribution and electronic equipment.*

---

## Lore

Transformers change voltage levels with elegant simplicity - alternating current in one coil induces current in another, with the voltage ratio determined by the number of turns in each winding. This principle powers everything from ship's lighting to sensitive electronic equipment.

Naval transformers must handle the electrical demands of increasingly sophisticated equipment. Radar sets require high voltages, fire control computers need stable power, and communications equipment demands clean signals. Each transformer is wound for its specific application, making them difficult to interchange and critical to maintain.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~86 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | -20% at production centers, +30% remote |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Industrial powers with electronics capability
- **Major Consumers**: Equipment manufacturers, repair yards
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper supply, skilled winding labor

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Critical for electronics operation
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Transformers are the power foundation for all electronic equipment. Without the right transformer, sophisticated equipment cannot operate. Damaged transformers require specialized rewinding or complete replacement.
