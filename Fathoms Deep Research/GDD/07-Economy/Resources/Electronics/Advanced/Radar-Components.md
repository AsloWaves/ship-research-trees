## Description

> *Assemblies and modules for radar systems. The building blocks of electronic eyes.*

## Lore

Radar components are the specialized parts that make radar systems function - timing circuits, pulse formers, receiver front-ends, antenna rotators, and countless other subsystems. Each component is designed for specific radar applications, and mixing components from different systems rarely works without extensive modification.

Repairing radar often means replacing entire component assemblies rather than fixing individual parts. The complexity of radar circuitry makes field repairs difficult, and keeping spare components aboard is essential for maintaining radar capability during extended operations. A ship without radar spares may lose its electronic eyes at the worst possible moment.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Radar Works | Hard | 2 per batch |
| Purchase | Major electronics centers | Hard | Premium price |
| Salvage | Radar equipment | Hard | 0-2 units |
| Trade | Naval electronics suppliers | Hard | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Complete radar systems, radar repairs
- **Construction**: Sensor installations
- **Consumable**: ✅ Replacement for failed modules
- **Trade**: Critical demand for radar-equipped vessels

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Vacuum Tubes ×8 + Transformers ×2 + Capacitors ×6 | Assembly | Radar Components ×1 | Radar Works |
| Radar Components ×3 + Magnetrons ×1 + Cathode Ray Tubes ×1 | Integration | Complete Radar ×1 | Advanced Electronics |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~390 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at radar production, +40% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom, Germany
- **Major Consumers**: All radar-equipped forces
- **Bottlenecks**: Specialized manufacturing, component matching

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for radar maintenance
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Radar components determine whether sophisticated radar systems stay operational. A ship without spare components may find its radar irreparable when tubes fail or circuits burn out. Component availability directly affects operational readiness.
