## Description

> *High-power microwave amplifiers for radar transmitters. The muscle behind radar's far-reaching signals.*

---

## Lore

Klystron tubes amplify microwave signals to the enormous power levels that radar requires. While magnetrons generate the initial pulses, klystrons boost them to megawatt levels that can reach across hundreds of miles of ocean. Without klystrons, radar would be limited to short-range detection.

The physics of klystrons is complex - electron beams pass through resonant cavities, gaining energy in precise bunches that amplify microwave frequencies. Manufacturing requires extraordinary precision and exotic materials. Klystrons are among the most advanced electronic devices of the era, representing the cutting edge of military technology.
