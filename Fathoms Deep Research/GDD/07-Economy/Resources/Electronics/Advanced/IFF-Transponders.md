## Description

> *Identification Friend or Foe systems to prevent friendly fire. They answer the question "whose side are you on?"*

---

## Lore

IFF transponders save lives by preventing friendly fire. When radar detects a contact, the IFF system sends a coded challenge. Friendly aircraft and ships carry transponders that automatically respond with the correct coded reply. No response, or the wrong response, marks the contact as hostile or unknown.

The codes must be changed regularly to prevent enemies from capturing and using them. The loss of an IFF unit is a serious security breach - the codes it contains must be immediately changed across the entire theater. IFF transponders are classified equipment, and their destruction is mandatory if capture is imminent.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Classified Electronics | Very Hard | 1 per batch |
| Purchase | Naval intelligence | Very Hard | Extreme restrictions |
| Salvage | Capture operations | Very Hard | 0-1 units (major event) |
| Contract | Intelligence services | Hard | Special mission reward |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Ship identification systems
- **Construction**: Combat information centers
- **Consumable**: N/A (code updates required)
- **Trade**: Restricted military equipment

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Radio Equipment ×1 + Crystal Oscillators ×4 | Classified Assembly | IFF Transponders ×1 | Classified Electronics |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2300 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (controlled) |
| **Regional Variance** | Military allocation only |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States, United Kingdom (classified)
- **Major Consumers**: Combat vessels, aircraft
- **Bottlenecks**: Security requirements, code management

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Prevents catastrophic friendly fire
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

IFF systems are critical for coordinated operations. Without them, radar contacts must be visually identified before engagement, negating much of radar's advantage. Friendly fire incidents without IFF can be devastating to morale and effectiveness.
