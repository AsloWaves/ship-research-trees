## Description

> *High-gain vacuum tubes for signal amplification. They make weak signals strong enough to use.*

---

## Lore

Amplifier tubes take faint signals and make them powerful. Radio receivers need them to boost weak transmissions into audible sound. Radar systems use them to amplify returning echoes. Fire control computers depend on them to process targeting data. Without amplification, electronic systems would be deaf and blind.

Quality matters enormously in amplifier tubes. Noisy tubes add static that masks weak signals. Tubes with inconsistent gain create unreliable outputs. Military-grade amplifier tubes are selected for consistent performance and low noise, representing the best that vacuum tube technology can achieve.
