## Description

> *Precision spinning mass instruments for navigation and stabilization. They know which way is up even when the sea doesn't.*

## Lore

Gyroscopes maintain their orientation regardless of how the platform beneath them moves. A rapidly spinning mass resists changes to its axis, creating a stable reference in a world of rolling, pitching ships. Gyrocompasses point true north without magnetic interference. Gyrostabilizers keep gun directors level despite heavy seas. Fire control depends on gyros to provide accurate targeting despite ship motion.

The precision required for naval gyroscopes is extraordinary. Bearings must be nearly frictionless, rotors perfectly balanced, housings isolated from vibration. Each gyroscope is a masterpiece of precision engineering, hand-assembled by skilled craftsmen and individually tested. The loss of a main gyro can cripple a ship's fire control or navigation.

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2400 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | -25% at precision facilities, +50% elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Only most advanced industrial nations
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ship construction, fire control
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme precision requirements, skilled labor

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Essential for modern fire control
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Gyroscopes are among the most critical components of modern naval warfare. Without them, fire control systems cannot compensate for ship motion, and accurate long-range gunnery becomes impossible. Gyroscope quality directly determines gunnery accuracy.
