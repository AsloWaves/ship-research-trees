## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Intact weapons systems salvaged from sunken warships. Can be refurbished for installation or studied for technological insights.

---

## Lore

When a warship goes down, its weapons often remain intact and can be salvaged by specialized diving crews. These recovered systems range from anti-aircraft guns to main battery turrets that survived the sinking. While salt water exposure means extensive refurbishment is required, the alternative—waiting months for factory production—makes salvage operations highly profitable. Intelligence services prize enemy weapons for technical analysis, while smaller navies often install salvaged guns on coastal defense positions or auxiliary vessels. The recovery of a complete 5-inch gun mount can equip an entire destroyer escort, making these finds worth their weight in gold.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Deep Wreck Salvage | Battleship/Cruiser wrecks | Very Hard | 1-2 units |
| Shallow Wreck Diving | Destroyer/Submarine wrecks | Hard | 1-3 units |
| Post-Battle Recovery | Recent sinking sites | Medium | 1-2 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be refurbished into functional weapon modules at shipyards
- **Construction**: Can be installed on ships or base defenses after overhaul
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Extremely high value; all factions seek these for quick armament

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Recovered Weapons x1 | Refurbishment | Weapon Module (various types) | Naval Yard |
| Recovered Weapons x1 | Technical Study | Research Data x3 + Steel x5 | Research Lab |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2000 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Island nations pay premium (+30%); major powers near factories pay less (-10%) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage operations in major battle zones (North Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval powers; smaller nations desperate for armament
- **Bottlenecks**: Deep-sea diving expertise; calm weather windows; wreck location knowledge

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recovered weapons represent immediate combat capability without factory delays. A salvaged 5-inch dual-purpose mount takes weeks to refurbish versus months to manufacture from scratch. Nations facing production bottlenecks or blockades will pay premium prices for these instant armament solutions. The intelligence value alone justifies the risk—studying enemy fire control systems or ammunition types provides crucial tactical advantages.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Rare | Base | Prefer new production but study captured systems |
| United Kingdom | Uncommon | +10% | Active salvage operations in Home Waters |
| Japan | Rare | +30% | Desperate for any armament late-war |
| Germany | Uncommon | +15% | U-boat warfare creates many wreck opportunities |
