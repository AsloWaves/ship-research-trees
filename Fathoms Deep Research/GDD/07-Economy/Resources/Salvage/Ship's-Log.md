## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Waterlogged logbook containing navigation records, operational orders, and daily activities. Invaluable intelligence source and historical document.

## Lore

A ship's log documents everything: position fixes, course changes, weather observations, engagement records, and command decisions. Intelligence services prize logs above almost all other salvage—they reveal convoy routes, patrol patterns, operational procedures, and tactical doctrines. A single destroyer's log might expose an entire fleet's movement schedule. Submarine logs are particularly valuable, showing attack procedures and evasion tactics. Cryptographers seek logs containing encoded messages and cipher references. Historians value logs as primary source documents of naval operations. Some logs survive remarkably well in sealed chart room safes, while others become illegible pulp. The last entries often read with haunting finality as crews documented their ship's death throes.

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~5150 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Enemy logs +200% to intelligence services; own logs +50% for archiving |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Intelligence recovery teams; specialized salvage operations
- **Major Consumers**: Military intelligence agencies, naval archives, research institutions
- **Bottlenecks**: Water damage limits readability; time-sensitive before deterioration; safe locations unknown

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Ship's logs contain operational intelligence of immense value. Enemy logs expose fleet movements, patrol schedules, communication procedures, and tactical doctrine. A recovered U-boat log might reveal entire wolf pack coordin ation methods. Surface vessel logs document convoy escort patterns and anti-submarine tactics. Code references help cryptographers break ciphers. Each log is unique and irreplaceable—intelligence goldmines worth dedicated recovery missions.

|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Very Rare | +150% enemy logs | Intelligence priority; aggressive recovery |
| United Kingdom | Very Rare | +180% enemy logs | Critical for anti-submarine warfare intelligence |
| Japan | Very Rare | +120% enemy logs | Intelligence value recognized but recovery limited |
| Germany | Very Rare | +140% enemy logs | U-boat logs particularly sought after |
