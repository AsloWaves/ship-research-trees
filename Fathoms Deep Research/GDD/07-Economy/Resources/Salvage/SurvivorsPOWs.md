## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Rescued naval personnel from sunken vessels, recovered from lifeboats and debris fields. Humanitarian and intelligence value.

---

## Lore

When warships sink, sailors fight for survival in the water—some reaching lifeboats, others clinging to wreckage. Recovery of survivors represents fundamental naval duty and humanitarian obligation. Own-nation survivors return to duty after recovery; enemy survivors become prisoners of war subject to Geneva Convention treatment. Beyond humanitarian concerns, rescued personnel provide intelligence: enemy sailors reveal technical details, tactical doctrines, and morale conditions. High-ranking officers possess valuable strategic knowledge. POW exchanges sometimes occur through neutral parties. Rescued crews also serve as witnesses to enemy capabilities and confirm intelligence reports. All major navies maintained rescue protocols, though effectiveness varied by circumstance and national policy.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|

| Water Rescue | Debris fields, sinking sites | Hard | 1-2 units |
| Organized Search | Known sinking coordinates | Medium | 2-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: N/A (personnel, not commodities)
- **Construction**: N/A
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: Repatriation of own personnel; intelligence interrogation; POW exchanges through neutral parties

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |

| Survivors/POWs (enemy) | Interrogation | Intelligence Data x8 | Intelligence Center |
| Survivors/POWs (friendly) | Debriefing | Intelligence Data x3 + Crew (returned to service) | Naval Base |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1080 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | N/A (not traded commercially) |
| **Regional Variance** | Not applicable—humanitarian/military matter, not economic |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: N/A (humanitarian rescue operations)
- **Major Consumers**: Own-nation naval forces (repatriation); intelligence services (interrogation)
- **Bottlenecks**: Search and rescue capability; time-critical survival window; weather conditions

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (not economic)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Survivor recovery represents humanitarian duty, intelligence opportunity, and morale impact. Rescuing own personnel maintains unit cohesion and demonstrates care for crews. Enemy prisoners provide technical intelligence, operational information, and morale assessment. High-ranking officers can reveal strategic planning and technological developments. The "credit value" represents the intelligence and repatriation worth, not economic trade—these are human beings deserving proper treatment per international law, not commodities.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | N/A | Extensive rescue operations; value own personnel highly |
| United Kingdom | Common | N/A | Strong rescue tradition; active recovery efforts |
| Japan | Rare | N/A | Cultural factors limited rescue priority historically |
| Germany | Uncommon | N/A | U-boat crews often rescued by both sides |
