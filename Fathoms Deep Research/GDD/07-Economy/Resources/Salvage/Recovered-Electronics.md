## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Salvaged radar sets, fire control computers, and communication equipment from sunken vessels. Valuable for reverse-engineering or direct reuse after drying and restoration.

## Lore

Electronic warfare equipment represents the cutting edge of naval technology. Radar sets, gyroscopic fire control computers, radio direction finders—these systems cost thousands of man-hours to produce and contain components that smaller nations simply cannot manufacture. When a cruiser sinks, intelligence teams race to salvage the electronics before they corrode beyond repair. A single recovered radar magnetron can reveal enemy frequency bands and power output specifications. Even waterlogged equipment holds value: vacuum tubes, transformers, and wiring can be stripped for parts. In the Pacific theater, both sides mounted dedicated salvage missions specifically to recover electronic countermeasure equipment from downed aircraft and sunken destroyers.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Bridge Salvage | Cruiser/Battleship wrecks | Very Hard | 2-4 units |
| Combat Information Center Recovery | Modern destroyer wrecks | Hard | 3-6 units |
| Quick Recovery | Fresh wrecks (within 24hr) | Medium | 4-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be restored to functional electronic modules or stripped for components
- **Construction**: Rebuilt radar/sonar/radio systems for ships
- **Consumable**: N/A
- **Trade**: High demand from all factions; intelligence services pay premium

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~195 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Intelligence services pay +50%; tech-backward nations pay +40% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage teams in active combat zones; specialized intelligence recovery units
- **Major Consumers**: Intelligence agencies, electronics manufacturers, ship refitters
- **Bottlenecks**: Speed critical—must recover before salt water destroys delicate components

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Electronics win battles—radar detects threats, fire control computers ensure accurate gunnery, and radio equipment coordinates fleet operations. Recovered electronics provide both immediate utility and intelligence windfall. Studying enemy radar frequencies allows jamming and deception tactics. Reverse-engineering fire control computers reveals calculation methods and aiming algorithms. Time-sensitive nature creates urgency: electronics must be recovered within days before corrosion destroys sensitive components.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Uncommon | Base | Advanced electronics in most wrecks |
| United Kingdom | Uncommon | +10% | Pioneered radar technology |
| Japan | Rare | +40% | Behind in electronics; desperate for samples |
| Germany | Uncommon | +20% | Excellent optics, mediocre radar; seek Allied tech |
