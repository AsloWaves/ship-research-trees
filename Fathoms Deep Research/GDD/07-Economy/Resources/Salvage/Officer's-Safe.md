## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Heavy locked safe recovered from officer's quarters. Contents unknown until opened - may contain documents, currency, personal valuables, or intelligence materials.

---

## Lore

Every naval officer above lieutenant rank keeps a personal safe in their quarters containing classified documents, operational funds, personal effects, and valuables. When ships sink, these safes often survive intact due to their heavy steel construction. Salvage divers specifically target officer's quarters for safe recovery, as contents can range from worthless personal letters to classified code books worth thousands. The safe itself remains locked until opened, creating a literal treasure chest gambling mechanic. Intelligence services pay premium prices for unopened safes from enemy vessels, hoping for strategic intelligence. Some legendary safes reportedly contained admiral's gold reserves or bearer bonds worth fortunes.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Cruiser/Battleship officer quarters | Very Hard | 1 unit |
| Deep Diving | Sunken capital ships | Extreme | 1 unit |
| Raid | Enemy vessels (boarding) | Hard | 1 unit |
| Special Mission | Intelligence operations | Hard | 1 unit (guaranteed quality contents) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not applicable - consumable loot container only
- **Construction**: Empty safes can be repurposed for storage or sold as scrap metal
- **Consumable**: Opens to reveal random high-value loot: currency, intelligence documents, rare materials, officer equipment
- **Trade**: Unopened safes command premium from intelligence brokers; opened safes sell contents individually

|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Officer's Safe x1 | Lockpicking | Random loot table (high-value) | Locksmith/Intelligence Workshop |
| Officer's Safe x1 | Forced Opening | Damaged contents + reduced loot quality | Any facility with tools |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~6500 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Intelligence brokers pay +50% for enemy nation safes, +100% for admiral/flagship safes |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvaged from officer quarters of sunken/damaged vessels
- **Major Consumers**: Intelligence services, treasure hunters, collectors, gamblers
- **Bottlenecks**: Difficulty accessing officer quarters in wrecks, competing salvage operations, locked/jammed safes

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Officer's safes represent the ultimate salvage lottery ticket. Intelligence value can be enormous - captured code books, operation orders, or cipher materials can compromise entire enemy fleets. Economic value varies wildly from a few hundred credits of personal effects to tens of thousands in bearer bonds or gold. The scarcity combined with random high-value contents makes safe recovery a priority for experienced salvage operations. Some players specialize in safe-cracking, developing lockpicking skills to maximize loot quality. Black markets always have buyers for unopened safes, no questions asked.
