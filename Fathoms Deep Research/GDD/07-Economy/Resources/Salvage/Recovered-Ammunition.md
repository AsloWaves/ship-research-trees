## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Intact shells, depth charges, and torpedo warheads salvaged from sunken ships. Must be carefully inspected for water damage before use.

## Lore

Ammunition represents months of factory production condensed into brass casings and steel shells. When a destroyer goes down with full magazines, hundreds of rounds sink with it—each one worth recovering. Properly sealed ammunition can survive immersion surprisingly well; brass casings protect powder charges, and armor-piercing shells remain viable indefinitely. Salvage crews prioritize ammunition recovery, especially exotic types like acoustic torpedoes or star shells that require specialized production. During desperate phases of the war, recovered ammunition literally keeps ships in the fight when supply lines fail. The risk comes from unstable explosives—waterlogged depth charges and corroded detonators make this the most dangerous salvage work.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Magazine Salvage | Destroyer/Cruiser wrecks | Hard | 8-15 units |
| Torpedo Room Recovery | Submarine wrecks | Very Hard | 5-10 units |
| Debris Field Collection | Surface battle sites | Medium | 10-20 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be inspected and reconditioned for direct use
- **Construction**: Loaded into ship magazines after safety inspection
- **Consumable**: Direct use as ammunition once verified safe
- **Trade**: High demand in combat zones; steady value everywhere

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Recovered Ammunition x10 | Inspection/Drying | Naval Ammunition x8 | Ammunition Depot |
| Recovered Ammunition x15 | Breakdown | TNT x8 + Brass x20 + Steel x10 | Salvage Yard |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | Combat zones +25%; blockaded regions +40% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage operations in battle zones; wreck divers
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces; coastal defense installations
- **Bottlenecks**: Safety inspection requirements; specialized handling equipment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Ammunition shortages lose battles. A destroyer with empty magazines is just expensive floating metal. Recovered ammunition provides immediate resupply without factory delays, especially valuable for specialized rounds like armor-piercing shells or anti-aircraft proximity-fuzed ammunition. The 20% loss rate during inspection (water damage, corrosion, unstable propellant) is acceptable when the alternative is having no ammunition at all. Blockaded forces pay premium prices for any munitions.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | Base | Abundant production but still salvage wreck sites |
| United Kingdom | Common | +5% | Active recovery in Home Waters |
| Japan | Uncommon | +40% | Critical shortages late-war; salvage prioritized |
| Germany | Common | +15% | U-boat losses create recovery opportunities |
