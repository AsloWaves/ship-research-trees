## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Dangerous unexploded shells, torpedoes, or bombs recovered from wrecks. Can be disarmed for valuable explosives and components, but carries significant risk.

---

## Lore

Naval battles leave behind thousands of rounds of unexploded ordnance - shells that struck armor without detonating, torpedoes with failed igniters, bombs that landed in water. Salvage operators handle these with extreme care, as they remain fully armed and dangerous. However, the contents are valuable: high-grade explosives, precision fuses, detonators, and metal casings worth recycling. Specialized ordnance disposal teams command premium fees for disarmament work. Some desperate salvagers bypass safety protocols for quick profits, occasionally with catastrophic results. Authorities regulate unexploded ordnance trade heavily, but black markets thrive on munitions recycling for improvised weapons and mining operations.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Battle sites, shipwrecks | Hard (dangerous) | 1-3 units |
| Bomb/Mine Disposal | Failed ordinance sites | Very Hard | 2-5 units |
| Looting | Damaged magazines | Extreme (explosion risk) | 3-8 units |
| Purchase | Black market only | N/A | Limited availability |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Can be disarmed to yield explosives, fuses, detonators, and scrap metal casings
- **Construction**: Explosives used for mining, demolition, improvised weapons
- **Consumable**: High risk - failed disarmament attempt destroys ordnance and damages ship/cargo
- **Trade**: Regulated commodity - legal sale requires licenses, black market pays premium, military contracts available

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Unexploded Ordnance x1 | Safe Disarmament | Explosives x3, Fuses x1, Metal Casing x1 | Ordnance Disposal Facility |
| Unexploded Ordnance x1 | Risky Disarmament | Variable yield (50% explosion chance) | Basic Workshop |
| Unexploded Ordnance x5 | Military Contract | 10,000+ credits | Government Buyer |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1500 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | +50% in mining regions, +80% black markets, -20% near military disposal facilities |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Battle sites, failed bombardments, scuttled ammunition ships
- **Major Consumers**: Mining operations, demolition contractors, improvised weapon manufacturers, governments
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme danger in collection, legal restrictions, specialized disarmament expertise

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Unexploded ordnance walks the line between treasure and tragedy. The explosives alone justify the risk for many salvagers, as military-grade compounds command premium prices. However, the danger is real - one mistake can sink your salvage vessel. Risk-reward mechanics make ordnance disposal a specialized profession. Intelligence services also pay for intact enemy ordnance to study fusing mechanisms and explosive compositions. The black market thrives on ordnance trade for regions where legitimate explosives are unavailable. Some players build reputations as "bomb runners," specializing in high-risk ordnance salvage and disposal.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | 100% | Abundant from Pacific operations, strict regulations |
| United Kingdom | Common | 105% | Atlantic theater generates supply, disposal programs |
| Japan | Uncommon | 115% | Limited disposal infrastructure increases value |
| Germany | Common | 110% | U-boat operations create ordnance salvage opportunities |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - risk-reward mechanics appropriately calibrated
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced rarity from Legendary to Uncommon to match historical ordnance failure rates
- **Known Issues**: Ensure explosion risk mechanics feel fair not punitive; consider skill-based disarmament mini-game
