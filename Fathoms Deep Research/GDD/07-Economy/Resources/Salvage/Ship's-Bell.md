## Lore

A ship's bell carries the vessel's soul. Engraved with name, commissioning date, and sometimes battle honors, these bells marked time aboard ship and summoned crew to stations. Naval tradition holds that recovering a sunken ship's bell honors the lost vessel and crew. Museums pay premium prices for bells from famous warships—the bell from a renowned battleship or victorious destroyer becomes a centerpiece exhibit. Veterans' organizations seek bells from ships where members served. Intelligence services value them for verifying ship identity and confirming kills. Collectors treasure bells as tangible connections to naval history. Some bells come from legendary vessels: carriers that won decisive battles, cruisers that fought to the last, submarines that never returned.

| **Base Value** | ~5749 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low (stable collectible market) |
| **Regional Variance** | Famous ships +200%; unknown vessels base price |

- **Major Consumers**: Naval museums, private collectors, veterans' groups, naval academies
- **Bottlenecks**: Each ship has only one bell; exact wreck location knowledge; diving depth

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Ship's bells possess immense historical and sentimental value but limited military utility. Intelligence services confirm vessel identity and wreck locations. The real value lies in heritage: bells from legendary ships command astronomical prices. A bell from a famous battleship might auction for 50x base value. Museums compete fiercely for bells from historically significant vessels. Each bell is unique and irreplaceable.
