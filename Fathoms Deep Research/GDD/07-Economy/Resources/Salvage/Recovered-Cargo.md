Sealed cargo containers, equipment crates, and supply boxes recovered from sunken merchant ships and transports. Contents unknown until opened.

## Lore

Merchantmen carry the sinews of war—machine tools, medical supplies, vehicle parts, aircraft components, and strategic materials. When convoy ships sink, their cargo becomes treasure waiting to be recovered. Watertight cargo holds often preserve goods surprisingly well: machinery arrives corroded but functional, canned rations remain edible, and rubber goods survive months underwater. The gamble lies in not knowing contents until recovery—a cargo hold might contain ball bearings worth their weight in gold, or worthless textiles ruined by seawater. Successful salvage operations have recovered entire shipments of aircraft engines, thousands of trucks worth of spare parts, and strategic materials that transformed local economies. Both sides prioritized recovering enemy cargo for intelligence assessment and material value.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Cargo Hold Salvage | Merchant ship wrecks | Hard | 3-8 units |
| Transport Recovery | Supply ship wrecks | Medium | 5-10 units |
| Container Recovery | Scattered cargo debris | Medium | 4-12 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Opened to reveal random trade goods, materials, or equipment
- **Construction**: Contents may include construction materials
- **Consumable**: May contain provisions, medical supplies, or other consumables
- **Trade**: High value as mystery cargo; traders speculate on contents

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Recovered Cargo x1 | Opening/Inspection | Random trade goods, strategic materials, or components | Salvage Yard |
| Recovered Cargo x5 | Bulk Processing | Mixed materials (varies widely) | Warehouse |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~240 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Blockaded regions +35%; major ports -5% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Salvage operations in convoy routes and battle zones
- **Major Consumers**: Merchants, speculators, military quartermasters
- **Bottlenecks**: Heavy lifting equipment; cargo identification; transport capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐

Recovered cargo is economically valuable but militarily variable. A lucky find might contain ball bearings, tungsten, or aircraft parts—materials worth fortunes. Most cargo contains useful but mundane goods: textiles, foodstuffs, industrial supplies. The gambling aspect creates speculation markets: traders buy unopened cargo hoping for valuable contents. Strategic impact comes from disrupting enemy supply lines—every ton recovered is a ton the enemy cannot use.
