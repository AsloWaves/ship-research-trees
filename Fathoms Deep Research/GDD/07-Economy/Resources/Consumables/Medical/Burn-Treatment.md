## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Specialized ointments, dressings, and treatments for combat burn injuries. Essential for fires, explosions, and steam scalding common in naval warfare.

---

## Lore

Burns are among the most common and devastating injuries in naval combat. Flash fires from ammunition explosions, burning fuel oil, superheated steam from ruptured pipes, and electrical fires create horrific burn casualties. American ships stock tannic acid jelly and petroleum-based ointments. British naval doctors pioneered saline bath treatments for extensive burns. Japanese sailors fear fire above all other combat hazards, and their medical kits emphasize burn treatment. German submariners face unique burn risks from battery acid and electrical fires in confined spaces. The distinctive smell of burn ointment becomes associated with battle damage. Experienced medical officers can tell burn severity at a glance and apply appropriate treatment rapidly. Ships without adequate burn treatment supplies face agonizing casualties who might otherwise be saved.

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Burn treatment is critically important because fire is one of the most feared hazards in naval combat. Ships without adequate burn treatment face horrible casualties who suffer needlessly. Quick application of burn treatment can mean the difference between minor scarring and fatal infection or shock. While not rare, maintaining sufficient stocks is essential because fire damage can create dozens of burn casualties in seconds. Smart damage control parties always carry burn treatment alongside fire extinguishers.
