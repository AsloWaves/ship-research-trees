## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Rigid supports for immobilizing broken bones and fractures. Essential for treating blast injuries and falls common during naval combat.

---

## Lore

Fractures are ubiquitous in naval warfare - blast concussions break bones, sailors are thrown against bulkheads, heavy equipment falls during combat maneuvers, and recoil from large guns can break limbs. American splints use lightweight wooden slats with canvas straps. British sailors learn to fashion emergency splints from deck planking if medical supplies run out. Japanese corpsmen carry bamboo splints, lighter than wood but equally effective. German engineering produces sophisticated metal splints with adjustable fittings. Every damage control party member learns basic splinting techniques. Proper splinting can mean the difference between a sailor returning to duty or losing a limb to improper healing. The distinctive sound of wooden splints being applied has become associated with post-battle casualty treatment.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Medical Supply Depots | Easy | 15-30 units |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Easy | 5-12 units |
| Production | Medical Facilities | Easy | 50+ units |
| Emergency Craft | Shipboard Workshops | Easy | 3-8 units (improvised) |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Orthopedic Kits (5x Splints per kit), First Aid Kits (2x per kit)
- **Construction**: Medical Bay orthopedic equipment (25 units per bay), Casualty Stations (20 units)
- **Consumable**: Treats fracture status, restores 12% crew health, prevents mobility penalties for 5 minutes
- **Trade**: Steady demand, low prices, bulk medical supply cargo

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~7 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +15% in remote ports, standard elsewhere (minimal variation) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All nations (simple manufacturing), local production common, improvised production possible
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, medical facilities, damage control teams
- **Bottlenecks**: Wood/metal materials (rarely an issue), canvas strap production, packaging for shipment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Splints are not rare but absolutely necessary. Untreated fractures can become permanent disabilities, removing crew from duty permanently. While individually low-value, the cumulative effect of having adequate splints means maintaining crew strength during prolonged operations. Ships can fashion emergency splints from available materials, but proper medical splints are far more effective. Smart captains maintain large stockpiles as they're lightweight, inexpensive, and essential.
