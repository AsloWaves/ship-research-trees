## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Compressed oxygen cylinders for treating smoke inhalation, gas exposure, and respiratory trauma. Critical for damage control operations in smoke-filled compartments.

---

## Lore

Medical oxygen saves lives during the deadly aftermath of fires and explosions. Smoke inhalation kills as many sailors as flames themselves. American damage control parties carry portable oxygen cylinders with masks. British sailors train extensively in oxygen administration for smoke casualties. Japanese forces struggle with limited oxygen supplies on smaller vessels. German U-boats maintain strict oxygen discipline due to limited air in submerged operations. The distinctive green oxygen cylinders become symbols of hope for sailors trapped in smoke-filled compartments. Quick oxygen administration can revive seemingly dead crewmen. Without adequate medical oxygen, toxic gas buildups from chemical fires or ammunition propellant smoke cause mass casualties even after fires are extinguished.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Medical Supply | Medium | 5-12 units |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Medium | 2-6 units |
| Production | Industrial Gas Suppliers | Medium | 20-40 units |
| Special Requisition | Damage Control Depots | Medium | 10-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for Damage Control Kits (2x Medical Oxygen per kit), Respiratory Treatment Equipment
- **Construction**: Required for Damage Control Stations (10 units per station), Medical Bays (15 units per bay)
- **Consumable**: Treats smoke inhalation, gas exposure, suffocation; restores 18% crew health; removes respiratory debuffs
- **Trade**: High demand on combat vessels, moderate prices, essential safety equipment

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Atmospheric Air, Compression Process | Industrial Gas Production | Medical Oxygen x10 | Gas Processing Facility |
| Medical Oxygen x2, Respirator Mask x1 | Equipment Assembly | Damage Control Respirator Kit | Safety Equipment Depot |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~40 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +45% in submarine bases, +30% on carriers (fire risk), standard at industrial ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (industrial gas producers), United Kingdom (wartime production), Germany (chemical industry), Japan (limited capacity)
- **Major Consumers**: All combat vessels, damage control teams, medical facilities, submarine forces
- **Bottlenecks**: High-pressure cylinder manufacturing, gas compression equipment, transport logistics, cylinder testing/certification

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Medical oxygen is absolutely critical for damage control operations. Ships without adequate oxygen supplies suffer massive casualties from smoke inhalation after fires. A single oxygen cylinder can save multiple lives during prolonged firefighting operations. The difference between having oxygen available and not having it determines whether damage control parties can enter smoke-filled spaces to save trapped crew and equipment. Essential for submarine operations where air quality is paramount.
