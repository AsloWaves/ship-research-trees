## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Specialized marine paint containing copper and tributyltin compounds that prevent barnacles, algae, and marine organisms from adhering to ship hulls. Essential for maintaining speed and fuel efficiency during extended operations.

## Lore

A fouled hull can reduce a ship's speed by 30% or more, turning a fast cruiser into a sluggish target. Anti-fouling paint prevents barnacles, algae, and sea growth from clinging to the hull below the waterline. American manufacturers like International Paint Company developed advanced copper-based formulations. British Admiralty specifications required regular hull maintenance in drydock - ships operating in tropical waters needed repainting every 6-12 months. German U-boats prized anti-fouling paint for maintaining submerged speed during long Atlantic patrols. Japanese destroyers operating in warm Pacific waters consumed vast quantities fighting aggressive tropical growth. Ships that skip anti-fouling maintenance pay the price in reduced speed, increased fuel consumption, and compromised tactical mobility. A clean hull means the difference between catching the enemy or becoming their prey.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Requisition | Drydock Facilities | Medium | 15-30 units |
| Production | Chemical Plants | Hard | 20-40 units |
| Salvage | Supply Ships | Easy | 5-15 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Component for complete hull maintenance kits, ship refit packages
- **Construction**: Required for drydock hull treatments, new ship construction (10-50 units depending on ship size)
- **Consumable**: Hull application restores 15% speed, reduces fuel consumption by 10%, prevents biofouling degradation
- **Trade**: High demand in tropical ports, moderate value, essential for fleet maintenance

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Copper Compounds, Binders, Solvents | Chemical Processing | Anti-Fouling Paint x15 | Chemical Manufacturing Plant |
| Paint, Anti-Fouling Paint x3, Brushes | Hull Treatment | Clean Hull (speed boost) | Drydock or Repair Facility |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~33 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +60% in tropical regions (high demand), +40% in Pacific theater, standard in temperate waters |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (International Paint Co.), United Kingdom (Admiralty suppliers), Germany (IG Farben), Japan (Kansai Paint)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, especially those operating in warm waters, drydock facilities, shipyards
- **Bottlenecks**: Copper compound availability, chemical processing capacity, specialized manufacturing facilities

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Critical for maintaining fleet speed and operational efficiency. Ships without proper anti-fouling treatment suffer progressive speed degradation, increased fuel costs, and tactical disadvantages. Particularly vital for vessels in tropical theaters where biofouling occurs rapidly. Regular hull maintenance with anti-fouling paint is essential for sustained naval operations.
