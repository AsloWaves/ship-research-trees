## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Inflatable rubber rafts stocked with survival supplies that provide floating sanctuary for shipwreck survivors. The difference between slow death and eventual rescue.

---

## Lore

When a ship goes down, life rafts become floating islands of hope in endless ocean. These rubber rafts, some with canopies for sun protection, carry emergency rations, water, medical supplies, and signaling equipment. American Carley floats saved thousands from Pacific waters. British rafts equipped with survival kits gave merchant mariners fighting chance against U-boats. Japanese survivors of carrier losses drifted for days in inadequate rafts. German U-boat crews abandoning their boats faced slim survival odds even with rafts in the frigid Atlantic. The men of USS Indianapolis floated for days awaiting rescue, many in rafts. Survivors of convoy ships torpedoed in mid-Atlantic owed their lives to well-stocked rafts. A ship with insufficient rafts is a coffin - regulations demanded enough capacity for all hands. Smart captains ensured rafts were maintained, stocked, and ready for instant deployment. In those desperate moments when the ship goes under, a raft means life.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Major Naval Depots | Hard | 2-5 units |
| Requisition | Fleet Supply Centers | Hard | 3-6 units |
| Production | Specialized Manufacturers | Very Hard | 5-10 units |
| Salvage | Derelict Ships | Medium | 1-3 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Complete abandon-ship systems, emergency evacuation equipment
- **Construction**: Required for all vessels (capacity for full crew), lifeboat davits, emergency stations
- **Consumable**: Enables crew survival at sea, provides 90% survival rate for 7 days, essential for ship operation compliance
- **Trade**: Extremely high value, critical safety equipment, strictly regulated, limited availability

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Rubber, Canvas, Survival Supplies | Manufacturing | Life Rafts x3 | Specialized Safety Equipment Factory |
| Life Rafts (deployed) | Abandon Ship Survival | Extended Crew Survival | Open Water |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1500 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | +100% in war zones, +60% in combat theaters, +40% in high-risk areas |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Major safety equipment manufacturers, specialized military contractors (limited production)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, merchant fleets, military transports, high-value ships
- **Bottlenecks**: Rubber supply, specialized manufacturing, survival equipment assembly, safety certification, limited production capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Absolutely critical life-saving equipment. Ships without adequate rafts cannot legally operate and crews will refuse dangerous missions. Extreme scarcity drives premium pricing. Legendary rarity reflects both manufacturing difficulty and critical importance. Possession of quality life rafts directly impacts crew morale, recruitment, and operational capability. No captain sails undermanned in rafts - it's suicide and mutiny combined.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Uncommon | Standard | Good production but high demand, comprehensive safety requirements |
| United Kingdom | Uncommon | +20% | Adequate supply, merchant marine priority |
| Japan | Rare | +80% | Severe shortages, low manufacturing priority |
| Germany | Rare | +60% | Limited production, prioritized for capital ships |
