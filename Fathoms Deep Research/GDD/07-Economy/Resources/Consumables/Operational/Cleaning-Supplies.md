## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Soap, brushes, rags, and cleaning compounds for maintaining ship cleanliness and crew health. Essential for preventing disease and maintaining operational standards aboard warships.

## Lore

A dirty ship is a sick ship. Naval regulations demand constant scrubbing, swabbing, and cleaning to prevent disease outbreaks in cramped quarters. Sailors spend hours holystoning decks, polishing brass, cleaning weapons, and maintaining compartments. British captains conducted rigorous cleanliness inspections - filth meant punishment. American ships consumed vast quantities of soap, disinfectant, and cleaning compounds. Japanese vessels maintained strict hygiene protocols despite supply shortages. German U-boats, despite impossible cleaning conditions, required crews to maintain what cleanliness they could. Poor sanitation led to dysentery, typhus, and other diseases that could cripple a crew faster than combat. Ships that maintained cleanliness standards kept crews healthy and combat-ready. A well-maintained ship with proper cleaning supplies had better morale, fewer sick crew, and superior operational readiness than neglected vessels where disease festered in dirty conditions.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Any Port | Easy | 20-40 units |
| Requisition | Military Bases | Easy | 30-60 units |
| Production | Civilian Factories | Easy | 40-80 units |
| Salvage | Supply Ships | Easy | 10-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Hygiene kits, medical sanitation packages, ship maintenance sets
- **Construction**: Not applicable - operational consumable
- **Consumable**: Maintains crew health (+3% effectiveness), prevents disease outbreaks, improves morale, required for weekly ship maintenance
- **Trade**: Very low value, universally available, bulk commodity

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low |
| **Regional Variance** | None - standardized commodity available everywhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All nations - domestic civilian production, universal availability
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, military bases, shipyards, hospitals
- **Bottlenecks**: None - abundant production capacity, simple manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (1/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Essential for crew health and morale but universally available and cheap. Ships that neglect cleaning supplies risk disease outbreaks that can devastate crew effectiveness. Regular use prevents health problems and maintains operational standards. Critical importance but minimal economic value due to abundant supply.
