## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Specialized naval paint formulated for disruptive dazzle patterns and tactical camouflage schemes. Reduces enemy targeting accuracy and visual detection range through optical deception.

## Lore

Camouflage at sea isn't about invisibility - it's about deception. Dazzle camouflage uses bold geometric patterns to confuse enemy rangefinders, making it difficult to determine a ship's heading, speed, and distance. American Measure schemes evolved from simple navy gray to complex multi-tone patterns optimized for different theaters. British ships wore elaborate dazzle stripes that turned silhouettes into visual puzzles. German capital ships favored Baltic patterns - light gray for northern waters. Japanese vessels used graduated schemes that blended with Pacific horizons. Repainting from one scheme to another required significant quantities of specialized paint. A well-executed camouflage scheme could reduce hit probability by 20% or more. Captains who invested in proper camouflage paint saved their ships when enemy shells missed due to optical confusion. In night combat, darker schemes provided crucial advantages, while daytime patterns emphasized disruption over concealment.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Paint Depots | Medium | 10-20 units |
| Requisition | Shipyards with Camouflage Programs | Medium | 15-25 units |
| Production | Specialized Paint Facilities | Hard | 25-40 units |
| Quest Rewards | Camouflage Design Missions | Hard | 20-35 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Complete camouflage scheme kits (Measure 12, 21, 22, 32, Dazzle patterns)
- **Construction**: Ship repainting (20-60 units depending on size), tactical customization, deception operations
- **Consumable**: Application reduces enemy accuracy by 12%, decreases detection range by 15%, provides tactical concealment bonus
- **Trade**: High demand for combat vessels, moderate value, tactical importance increases in active combat zones

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Paint, Pigments, Specialized Additives | Camouflage Formulation | Camouflage Paint x12 | Paint Manufacturing Facility |
| Camouflage Paint x25, Design Plans | Ship Camouflage Application | Tactical Camouflage Scheme | Shipyard or Drydock |

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Camouflage provides direct combat advantages through optical deception. Proper camouflage schemes reduce enemy hit probability, complicate range estimation, and decrease detection distances. Particularly valuable for capital ships, commerce raiders, and convoy escorts operating in contested waters. Different theaters and tactical situations require different schemes, creating ongoing demand for repainting.
