## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Heavy-duty materials for sealing major hull breaches. Contains steel plates, rivets, and waterproof sealants for emergency repairs.

## Lore

When a torpedo or shell tears through a ship's hull below the waterline, seconds count. Hull patch kits provide the steel plates and collision mats needed to slow flooding until proper repairs can be made. The USS Yorktown at Coral Sea took bomb damage that should have sunk her, but damage control parties using hull patches kept her afloat long enough to fight again at Midway. These kits contain pre-cut steel plates, pneumatic rivet guns, quick-drying cement compounds, and collision mats that can be pulled over external breaches. Experienced crews can deploy these in minutes, buying crucial time to reach safe harbor.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Major Naval Bases | Easy | 1-3 kits |
| Salvage | Shipwrecks | Hard | 1-6 kits |
| Craft | Shipyard Workshop | Medium | 1 kit per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Welding Supplies to create Structural Repair Systems
- **Construction**: Essential for drydock repair facilities
- **Consumable**: Repairs 20-35% hull damage, permanently seals hull breaches
- **Trade**: Premium prices at forward bases, moderate demand in safe zones

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel Plate, Rivets, Sealant | Fabrication | Hull Patch Kit | Shipyard |
| Scrap Metal + Tools | Salvage Processing | Hull Patch Kit | Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~46 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Combat zones +50%, rear areas standard, industrial centers -10% |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (Great Lakes shipyards), United Kingdom (Clydeside), Japan (Osaka)
- **Major Consumers**: Capital ships, heavy cruisers, submarine tenders
- **Bottlenecks**: Steel plate production capacity, specialized sealant manufacturing

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Essential for capital ship survivability. A battleship or carrier that takes a torpedo hit without hull patch kits available is likely lost. The weight and bulk of these kits means ships must carefully balance offensive capability against damage resilience. Smart captains stock extra patches before entering dangerous waters.
