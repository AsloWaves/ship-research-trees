## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Welding rods, acetylene, and protective equipment for metal repairs. Essential for permanent hull and structural fixes.

## Lore

Welding transformed naval warfare - steel ships could be repaired at sea with portable equipment. Emergency welds sealed hull breaches, reinforced damaged frames, and restored structural integrity. American destroyer escorts in the Atlantic welded battle damage while still on patrol. British repair ships in the Mediterranean performed emergency welds on damaged warships to keep them fighting. These supplies include welding rods, oxygen and acetylene cylinders, protective gear, and cutting equipment. Quality welds require skill, but even crude emergency welds can keep a ship afloat until proper repairs. Japanese ships often lacked adequate welding supplies on extended operations, limiting their repair capabilities. The ability to weld under combat conditions - with the ship rolling, compartments flooding, and fires nearby - distinguished superior damage control teams.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Easy | 5-20 units |
| Salvage | Industrial Sites | Medium | 3-15 units |
| Craft | Chemical Plant | Medium | 10 units per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Hull Patch Kits for Permanent Structural Repairs
- **Construction**: Essential for shipyard facilities and repair docks
- **Consumable**: Permanently seals hull breaches, restores structural integrity (25-40% hull repair)
- **Trade**: Consistent demand, stable prices, good trading commodity

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel Rod, Flux, Gases | Manufacturing | Welding Supplies | Industrial Plant |
| Scrap Metal, Chemicals | Production | Welding Supplies | Chemical Factory |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Combat zones +15%, industrial centers standard |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (steel mills), United Kingdom (industrial centers), Germany (Ruhr region)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, repair ships, shipyards, forward bases
- **Bottlenecks**: Gas cylinder production, steel rod manufacturing, shipping capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

High value for permanent repairs and operational sustainability. Ships with adequate welding supplies can make lasting repairs rather than temporary patches. Essential for extended operations away from shipyards. The relatively low cost makes it accessible but requires skilled operators.
