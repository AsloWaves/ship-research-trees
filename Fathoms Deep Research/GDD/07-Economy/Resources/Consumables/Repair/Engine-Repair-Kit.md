## Lore

A dead engine is a death sentence. Without propulsion, ships become stationary targets unable to maneuver, maintain station, or retreat. These comprehensive kits contain precision-machined gaskets, replacement bearings, piston rings, valve components, and specialized tools required for emergency turbine or diesel repairs. German U-boats operating far from home ports depended on meticulous engine maintenance, while American destroyer escorts in the Pacific needed constant engine care in tropical conditions. British engineers on HMS Warspite kept her running despite battle damage that should have crippled her engines. These kits represent the difference between limping home at reduced speed and being abandoned to the enemy. The weight and bulk reflect the complexity of WW2-era marine propulsion systems.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Major Naval Bases | Medium | 1-3 kits |
| Salvage | Shipwrecks, Derelicts | Hard | 1-4 kits |
| Craft | Machine Shop | Hard | 1 kit per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Spare Parts to create Complete Engine Overhaul Kits
- **Construction**: Essential for shipyard engine workshops and repair facilities
- **Consumable**: Restores 15-25% engine power, repairs critical propulsion damage
- **Trade**: Very high demand in all theaters, premium prices everywhere

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Steel Parts, Gaskets, Bearings | Precision Manufacturing | Engine Repair Kit | Machine Shop |
| Salvaged Engine Parts | Refurbishment | Engine Repair Kit | Naval Yard |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~225 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High |
| **Regional Variance** | Forward bases +60%, isolated ports +80%, major yards standard |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (Detroit machine shops), United Kingdom (Glasgow engineering firms), Germany (Krupp facilities)
- **Major Consumers**: All warships, particularly destroyers and submarines with stressed engines
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision machining capacity, specialty steel availability, skilled machinists

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Absolutely critical for fleet operations. A ship without engines cannot retreat, maneuver, or maintain battle formations. Engine damage turns aggressive warships into stationary defensive positions. Particularly vital for submarines, destroyers, and fast carriers. The high value reflects both the precision manufacturing required and the strategic importance of maintaining mobility.
