## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Portable CO2 and foam fire suppression equipment. Essential for controlling shipboard fires before they spread.

## Lore

Fire is the most feared killer at sea. Wooden decks, fuel tanks, ammunition magazines, and hydraulic fluid create an environment where a single spark can doom a ship. HMS Hood exploded from a magazine fire, USS Franklin nearly sank from aviation fuel fires, and countless vessels were lost to flames rather than enemy action. These pressurized extinguishers contain carbon dioxide or chemical foam designed to smother fires in their early stages. American damage control doctrine emphasized aggressive firefighting, while Japanese ships often struggled with inadequate firefighting equipment. A fire left unchecked for even minutes can render a ship unsalvageable. These extinguishers represent the first line of defense against the most dangerous enemy aboard any warship.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Naval Supply Depots | Easy | 2-10 units |
| Salvage | Damaged Ships | Easy | 3-12 units |
| Craft | Chemical Factory | Medium | 5 units per batch |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Combined with Damage Control Kits to create Fire Suppression Systems
- **Construction**: Required for damage control stations and magazine safety systems
- **Consumable**: Extinguishes fires in one compartment, prevents fire spread
- **Trade**: Consistent demand everywhere, stable prices

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| CO2, Pressure Vessel, Foam | Manufacturing | Fire Extinguishers | Chemical Plant |
| Empty Cylinders + Refill | Recharge | Fire Extinguishers | Supply Depot |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~28 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - universally needed (+5% maximum variance) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (chemical manufacturers), United Kingdom (industrial producers), all major ports
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, particularly carriers and ships with large fuel stores
- **Bottlenecks**: Pressure vessel manufacturing, CO2 production capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Critical for ship survival but relatively easy to produce. Every ship needs abundant firefighting equipment. The difference between USS Franklin surviving and sinking was aggressive firefighting with available equipment. Ships that neglect to stock adequate extinguishers are courting disaster.
