## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Specialized fuel for ship's galley operations. Essential for hot meal preparation and crew morale maintenance during extended deployments.

---

## Lore

Naval galleys required dedicated cooking fuel separate from ship propulsion systems. While coal-fired ships could theoretically use engine coal for cooking, quality and allocation concerns made specialized cooking fuel standard. Oil-fired vessels used separate kerosene or diesel allocations for galley stoves. The ability to serve hot meals dramatically affected crew morale - cold rations for extended periods led to discontent and reduced effectiveness. During battle stations when galley fires were extinguished for safety, crews relied on cold emergency rations, making the return to hot meals a psychological boost. Submariners particularly valued cooking fuel as it enabled hot coffee and meals in cramped, damp conditions where comfort was scarce. Japanese submarines often conserved fuel by serving cold rice, while Allied boats prioritized hot meals as morale necessity. Damaged ships sometimes had to choose between limited fuel for propulsion or feeding the crew, a grim calculus that affected operational decisions. The smell of cooking food spread throughout ships, becoming a powerful morale factor that commanders recognized as combat-essential.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Requisition | Any Major Port | Easy | 30-45 units |
| Refinery Direct | Industrial Ports | Easy | 40-60 units |
| Supply Ship Transfer | Any Controlled Waters | Medium | 20-35 units |
| Local Purchase | Coastal Settlements | Medium | 15-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for preparing hot meals from raw provisions
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Enables galley operations. Consumed 1 unit per day for hot meals. Hot meals provide +12% morale vs +5% for cold rations.
- **Trade**: Steady demand from vessels with galley facilities. Can substitute for emergency heating in damaged ships.

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Raw Provisions + Cooking Fuel | Galley Cooking | Hot Meals (increased morale value) | Ship's Galley |
| Canned Food + Cooking Fuel | Heating | Warm Rations (moderate morale bonus) | Ship's Galley |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~8 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium (follows oil market trends) |
| **Regional Variance** | Industrial ports: Base price. Remote outposts: +100%. War zones: +75% (scarcity premium) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Oil refineries (kerosene/diesel production), coal processing facilities, industrial chemical plants
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels with galley facilities, merchant marine, shore installations with mess halls
- **Bottlenecks**: Competes with aviation fuel and propulsion fuel for refinery capacity, container/drum availability, fire safety regulations limit onboard storage

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical for morale, essential for crew effectiveness)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (Steady industrial demand)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Available but competes with other fuel priorities)

Cooking fuel represents the intersection of morale, logistics, and operational effectiveness. Ships without adequate cooking fuel must serve cold rations, significantly impacting crew performance over time. The 7% morale difference between hot and cold meals compounds during extended operations, potentially determining mission success. Players must balance cargo space between cooking fuel and other provisions - running out forces difficult choices between crew welfare and other operational needs. Submarines and long-range raiders should prioritize cooking fuel as the morale impact is most severe during extended isolated operations. The resource becomes more critical in cold climates where hot meals and beverages are psychologically essential. Smart commanders maintain cooking fuel reserves even when sacrificing other less critical supplies.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Very Common | Base price | Abundant oil refining capacity, well-supplied logistics |
| United Kingdom | Common | Base price +10% | Good supply but must import some petroleum products |
| Japan | Common (early war), Rare (late war) | Base price +50% | Oil shortages affect all petroleum derivatives severely |
| Germany | Common | Base price +25% | Synthetic fuel programs provided alternatives but expensive |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - consumption rate and morale benefit create meaningful logistics planning
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced daily consumption from 2 units to 1 unit after testing showed excessive cargo burden
- **Known Issues**: Consider adding emergency substitution mechanic using ship propulsion fuel at efficiency penalty
