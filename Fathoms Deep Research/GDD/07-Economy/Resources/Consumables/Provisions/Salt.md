## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Essential mineral for food preservation and crew nutrition. Critical logistics item for extended naval operations without refrigeration.

---

## Lore

Though largely superseded by refrigeration and canning by WWII, salt remained an essential naval provision. It served multiple critical functions: preserving fresh fish caught at sea, seasoning otherwise bland preserved rations, maintaining crew electrolyte balance in tropical climates, and treating minor wounds as antiseptic. Submarines on extended patrols relied on salt to preserve supplemental fresh provisions acquired at neutral ports. Island garrisons used salt to preserve locally sourced food, reducing dependence on vulnerable supply ships. Japanese forces in the Pacific particularly valued salt as their supply situation deteriorated - it enabled them to utilize local fishing to supplement dwindling rations. Ships operating in hot climates issued salt tablets to prevent heat exhaustion among engineering crews working in boiler rooms. The substance's stability and long shelf life made it ideal for emergency supplies, and it required no special storage conditions unlike perishable provisions.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Requisition | Any Major Port | Very Easy | 50-70 units |
| Coastal Harvesting | Salt Flats/Evaporation Ponds | Easy | 30-50 units |
| Local Purchase | Any Settlement | Very Easy | 40-60 units |
| Mine Extraction | Rock Salt Deposits | Medium | 60-90 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Used in preserving fresh provisions, creating preserved meat/fish, medical kits
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Passive benefit - extends food storage time by 50%. Essential for tropical climate health (+5% crew performance in hot regions).
- **Trade**: Low value but steady demand. Useful for trading with isolated garrisons or island communities.

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Fresh Fish + Salt | Salting/Curing | Preserved Fish (extended shelf life) | Galley |
| Fresh Meat + Salt | Salting/Curing | Preserved Meat (extended shelf life) | Galley |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low (abundant and stable) |
| **Regional Variance** | Coastal regions: Base price -20%. Inland ports: +30%. Island outposts: +50% (transport costs) |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Coastal evaporation facilities worldwide, rock salt mines (Germany, USA, UK), sea salt harvesting
- **Major Consumers**: All naval forces, merchant marine, island garrisons, tropical climate operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Packaging/containerization (bags/barrels), cargo space allocation, moisture contamination during transport

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Important for extended operations)
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (Cheap and abundant)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (Universally available)

Salt represents essential but unglamorous logistics. While not scarce or valuable, its absence creates significant operational problems. Ships planning extended cruises without port access should carry adequate salt stores. The resource becomes more important in tropical theaters where heat stress and food preservation challenges are greatest. Players operating submarines or conducting long-range raiding should prioritize salt to enable consumption of fresh provisions acquired opportunistically. In survival situations or when supply lines are cut, salt can mean the difference between starvation and successfully utilizing local food sources. Its utility in crafting preserved foods makes it valuable for player-operated supply networks.
