## Description

Ground coffee beans for brewing the hot beverage that keeps watch-standers alert and crews functioning. The fuel of naval operations.

## Lore

Coffee is the lifeblood of naval watch-standing. Four hours on, four hours off - watchstanders survive on coffee. American ships consumed coffee by the gallon, brewed strong enough to strip paint. British vessels preferred tea but still maintained coffee for variety. Japanese crews drank less coffee, preferring green tea. German U-boat crews relied on ersatz coffee when real supplies ran low. The midnight watch needed coffee to stay alert scanning dark horizons for threats. Engine room crews drank it by the pot in sweltering heat. Cooks brewed fresh pots every watch change. A ship without coffee faced exhausted, less-alert crews. Coffee boosted morale, improved alertness, and provided comfort in harsh conditions. Smart supply officers never let coffee stocks run low. Crews could endure many hardships, but taking away their coffee invited mutiny.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | Any Port | Easy | 20-40 units |
| Requisition | Military Bases | Easy | 30-60 units |
| Production | Coffee Roasters | Easy | 40-80 units |
| Salvage | Supply Ships | Easy | 10-30 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not applicable - direct consumption
- **Construction**: Not applicable - provisions
- **Consumable**: Boosts crew alertness (+4% watch efficiency), improves morale (+3%), reduces fatigue, essential for sustained operations
- **Trade**: Low value bulk commodity, universally available

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Coffee Beans | Roasting & Grinding | Coffee x50 | Coffee Roaster |
| Coffee, Fresh Water | Brewing | Crew Sustenance | Ship Galley |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +15% in coffee-producing regions, standard elsewhere |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Brazil, Colombia, Central America (imported by all navies)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels, especially American ships, military bases
- **Bottlenecks**: Bean supply, shipping, processing capacity

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Economic Value**: ⭐ (1/5)
**Scarcity**: ⭐ (1/5)

Important for crew morale and alertness but not mission-critical. Ships can operate without coffee but face morale problems and reduced watch efficiency. Widely available and cheap. Significant morale impact makes it valuable despite low economic cost.
