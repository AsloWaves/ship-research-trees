## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Purified drinking water in sealed containers. Most critical provision for naval operations, crew survival depends entirely on adequate fresh water supply.

## Lore

Fresh water was the absolute limiting factor for naval operations throughout history, and WWII was no exception despite technological advances. Early-war vessels carried water in tanks, with careful rationing enforced during long deployments. Submariners faced particularly acute water constraints - U-boats and fleet submarines had limited distillation capacity, forcing crews to endure strict water rationing that allowed only minimal washing and cooking. Surface ships gradually adopted evaporators that could produce fresh water from seawater, dramatically extending operational range. However, these systems consumed fuel and required maintenance, creating trade-offs between water production and combat capability. Pacific theater operations were especially water-critical due to tropical heat increasing consumption while coral atolls offered no fresh water sources. Damaged ships with non-functional evaporators faced crisis situations, sometimes requiring emergency resupply or abandoning operations. Japanese forces particularly struggled with water logistics in isolated garrisons, where lack of fresh water proved as dangerous as enemy action. Water contamination could disable entire crews through dysentery, making water quality as important as quantity. The ability to produce or acquire fresh water often determined operational tempo more than ammunition or fuel.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Requisition | Any Port | Very Easy | 40-60 units |
| Evaporator Production | At Sea (equipped ships) | Easy | 20-30 units/day |
| Natural Source Collection | Rivers/Springs | Medium | 30-50 units |
| Supply Ship Transfer | Any Waters | Easy | 35-55 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for cooking, medical treatments, boiler operations (emergency), crew hygiene
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: CRITICAL - consumed 2 units per crew member per day. Without adequate water, crew effectiveness drops 10% per day, death after 5 days.
- **Trade**: Extremely high value in water-scarce regions. Emergency resupply missions command premium prices. Essential for isolated garrison trade.

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Seawater + Fuel | Distillation | Fresh Water | Evaporator System |
| Contaminated Water + Purification Tablets | Purification | Fresh Water | Basic Filtering Kit |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~10 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | High (extreme in water-scarce regions) |
| **Regional Variance** | Major ports: Base price. Coral atolls: +400%. Desert coastal regions: +300%. Temperate zones: Base price |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Municipal water systems at ports, ship evaporators, natural freshwater sources, water tankers
- **Major Consumers**: All vessels, island garrisons, desert region operations, damaged ships with non-functional evaporators
- **Bottlenecks**: Container availability (barrels, tanks), evaporator reliability, fuel for distillation, contamination risks, storage capacity limits

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Absolutely critical, no operations possible without it)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐ (High in scarce regions, low where abundant)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Region-dependent, critical in Pacific/Mediterranean)

Fresh water is THE fundamental constraint on naval operations. Unlike ammunition or fuel which limit combat capability, water shortage ends all operations absolutely. Players must carefully calculate water consumption against crew size and deployment duration. Ships with functioning evaporators gain massive strategic advantage through water independence. Water shortage creates cascading problems: reduced cooking quality, hygiene failures leading to disease, heat casualties in tropical operations, and ultimately crew death. Smart players invest in evaporator systems early and maintain redundant water production capacity. Emergency water resupply missions to stranded vessels or isolated garrisons can be highly profitable. The resource represents the unglamorous reality that basic survival logistics often mattered more than weapons technology in determining naval success.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - high consumption rate creates meaningful logistics challenge without being punitive
- **Adjustment History**: Reduced consumption from 3 units to 2 units per crew per day after testing showed excessive micromanagement
- **Known Issues**: Evaporator systems may need reliability/maintenance mechanics to prevent water from becoming trivial once acquired
