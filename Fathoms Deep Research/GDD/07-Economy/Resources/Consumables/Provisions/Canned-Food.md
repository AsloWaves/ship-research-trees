Preserved food in sealed metal cans. Staple provision for naval forces, offering long shelf life and reliable nutrition during extended operations.

## Lore

Canned food represented the backbone of WWII naval logistics. Unlike perishable provisions requiring refrigeration or salt preservation, canned goods offered reliable nutrition with minimal storage requirements. American forces enjoyed the best variety - canned meat, vegetables, fruit, and even complete meals. British sailors made do with bully beef, tinned vegetables, and the infamous tinned hardtack. Japanese forces relied heavily on canned rice, pickled vegetables, and preserved fish as their supply situation deteriorated. German U-boats packed holds with canned sausages, vegetables, and condensed milk for extended patrols. The psychological impact of canned food quality varied enormously - monotonous canned rations over months eroded morale, while variety maintained spirits. Sailors developed elaborate trading networks, swapping canned items to create variety from standard issue. Canned food's reliability made it the emergency fallback when all other provisions failed. However, vitamin deficiencies from purely canned diets became a concern on very long patrols, requiring vitamin supplements. The distinctive sound of opening canned rations became part of naval routine, from peaceful transits to desperate survival situations in lifeboats.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Port Requisition | Any Major Port | Very Easy | 50-80 units |
| Factory Direct | Industrial Ports | Easy | 70-100 units |
| Supply Ship Transfer | Any Waters | Very Easy | 40-70 units |
| Salvage | Abandoned Vessels/Depots | Medium | 30-60 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Used in creating emergency ration packs, field meals, survival kits
- **Construction**: Not applicable
- **Consumable**: Basic sustenance - consumed 1 unit per crew member per day. Provides baseline nutrition. Cold consumption gives +5% morale, heated gives +8% morale.
- **Trade**: Universal demand, reliable value. Good trading commodity due to stability and universal need. Useful for establishing supply depots.

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Fresh Provisions + Canning Equipment | Industrial Canning | Canned Food | Food Processing Facility |
| Canned Food + Cooking Fuel | Heating | Warm Meal (improved morale) | Ship's Galley |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~2 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very Low (stable production and demand) |
| **Regional Variance** | Industrial nations: Base price. Remote regions: +30%. Blockaded areas: +150%. Generally stable globally |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: United States (massive canning industry), United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Japan (domestic production)
- **Major Consumers**: All military forces, civilian populations under rationing, emergency stockpiles, long-range vessels
- **Bottlenecks**: Metal tin availability (critical war material), factory capacity competition with munitions, labor for canning operations, transportation to forward bases

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Essential baseline provision, enables all operations)
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐ (Cheap and abundant but universally needed)
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐ (Generally available, shortages only in extreme situations)

Canned food is the workhorse provision that enables naval operations to exist. While not exciting, its absence means mission failure more surely than lack of ammunition. Players should always maintain substantial canned food reserves as emergency backup when other provisions run short. The resource's long shelf life makes it ideal for pre-positioning supplies at forward operating bases. Unlike fresh provisions requiring special handling, canned food survives damage, rough handling, and storage neglect. Its reliability makes it the foundation of any supply plan, with more sophisticated provisions supplementing rather than replacing it. During desperate situations - damaged ships, lifeboat survival, cut-off garrisons - canned food becomes the difference between survival and starvation. The modest morale penalty compared to fresh food is acceptable given its logistical advantages.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Very Common | Base price -15% | Huge canning industry, best variety and quality |
| United Kingdom | Very Common | Base price | Good availability but limited variety, Spam and bully beef |
| Japan | Common (early), Uncommon (late) | Base price +25% | Adequate early war, tin shortages affected late war production |
| Germany | Common | Base price +10% | Good domestic production, captured stocks supplemented supply |

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for balancing this resource*

- **Current State**: Balanced - low cost and high availability offset by modest morale benefit, creating incentive for provision diversity
- **Adjustment History**: Adjusted consumption rate to 1 unit per crew per day to match historical ration sizes
- **Known Issues**: May need long-term vitamin deficiency mechanic for crews subsisting entirely on canned rations for extended periods
