## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision-ground optical lenses for rangefinders, binoculars, and periscopes. Each lens is individually polished to exacting tolerances for maximum clarity.

## Lore

Precision lens grinding was an art form perfected over decades by specialized craftsmen. Each lens element in a battleship's rangefinder system required hours of careful grinding and polishing, with tolerances measured in fractions of a wavelength of light. The German optical houses employed master lens grinders whose skills were considered state secrets, while American manufacturers pioneered semi-automated grinding techniques to achieve the production volumes demanded by wartime expansion.

The quality of individual lenses directly affected combat performance. A single flawed lens in a 15-meter rangefinder could introduce parallax errors that threw off range estimates by hundreds of yards. During the Battle of the Denmark Strait, Prince of Wales suffered from mechanical issues with her recently installed fire control system, but it was lens calibration problems that prevented her from landing decisive hits on Bismarck. Naval architects learned that even the finest optical glass was useless without proper lens fabrication.

Replacement lenses became critical maintenance items for ships operating far from home ports. Damage from saltwater spray, temperature changes, and combat shock could degrade optical performance within months. Submarine crews particularly valued spare periscope lenses, as a cracked lens meant blind navigation until reaching a repair facility. The black market for captured enemy lenses flourished in neutral ports, where optical specialists could reverse-engineer manufacturing techniques from finished products.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Optical workshops with grinding equipment | High | 3-6 units |
| Purchase | Specialized optical suppliers, naval arsenals | Medium | 1-15 units |
| Salvage | Damaged optical instruments, captured equipment | High | 1-2 units |
| Quest Reward | Fire control upgrade missions | Medium | 2-5 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Binoculars, Telescopes, Rangefinder Elements, Periscope Optics, Camera Equipment

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~35 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium-High |
| **Regional Variance** | +50% in remote Pacific bases, +30% at forward repair facilities, -10% near major manufacturing centers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss), USA (Bausch & Lomb), UK (Cooke), Japan (Tokyo Optical)
- **Major Consumers**: Naval repair yards, fire control system manufacturers, submarine maintenance facilities, optical instrument shops
- **Bottlenecks**: Skilled lens grinders, precision grinding equipment, long processing times, quality control failures

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Lenses are the critical components that transform raw optical glass into functional naval equipment. Without replacement lenses, damaged fire control systems cannot be repaired, submarines lose their ability to observe while submerged, and surface vessels operate with degraded gunnery accuracy. The specialized skills required for lens grinding create production bottlenecks that cannot be easily overcome, making lenses more valuable than the raw optical glass they're made from.
