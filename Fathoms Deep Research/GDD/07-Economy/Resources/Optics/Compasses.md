## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Standard magnetic compasses salvaged from damaged vessels. Essential for basic navigation and fire control systems.

---

## Lore

Every warship from destroyer to battleship carries multiple compasses for navigation, backup systems, and damage control stations. While magnetic compasses are considered basic technology, their reliability in combat conditions makes them invaluable. Salvaged compasses are common finds after naval engagements, often stripped from damaged stations before ships sink. All major naval powers produce standardized compasses, though British and German models are prized for their precision.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Damaged vessels | Easy | 2-5 units |
| Looting | Shipwrecks | Easy | 1-3 units |
| Purchase | Port merchants | N/A | Unlimited |
| Crafting | Optical workshop | Medium | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for basic fire control systems, navigation stations, and backup helm installations
- **Construction**: Essential component for small vessel bridges and damage control stations
- **Consumable**: Not consumed directly
- **Trade**: Steady demand from repair operations, low profit margins due to common availability

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Brass Fittings x2, Glass Lenses x1 | Assembly | Compasses x1 | Optical Workshop |
| Damaged Compass x3 | Refurbishment | Compasses x2 | Repair Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~26 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | Minimal - widely available at all ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: All major naval powers, civilian manufacturers
- **Major Consumers**: Ship repair facilities, small vessel builders, damage control operations
- **Bottlenecks**: Quality brass fittings during wartime shortages

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐

While basic technology, compasses remain essential for ship operations. Every damage control station needs a compass, and backup navigation systems require them. Their low value reflects ubiquitous availability, but naval operations cannot function without them. Strategic importance lies in volume requirements rather than individual unit value.
