## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision-coated optical mirrors for periscopes, searchlights, and fire control systems. Silver or aluminum-coated glass surfaces provide maximum reflectivity for naval optical instruments.

---

## Lore

Naval optical mirrors demanded far higher quality than civilian applications. Unlike household mirrors, naval mirrors needed to maintain their reflectivity in salt-laden atmospheres, extreme temperature variations, and the constant vibration of gunnery. First-surface mirrors—with their reflective coating on the front rather than protected behind glass—gave the best optical performance but degraded rapidly in marine environments. The challenge of balancing durability against optical quality consumed years of metallurgical research.

German submarines pioneered the use of rhodium-coated mirrors in periscope heads, achieving remarkable resistance to saltwater corrosion. British manufacturers favored silver coatings protected by thin lacquer layers, which required frequent replacement but offered superior reflectivity. American mass production techniques focused on aluminum coatings that could be applied rapidly, trading some optical quality for production volume. Japan's limited access to specialized coating materials forced their optical shops to reclaim and re-coat salvaged mirrors from damaged equipment.

Searchlight mirrors presented unique challenges. The 60-inch searchlights mounted on battleships and cruisers used parabolic mirrors that took weeks to grind and coat, with each mirror weighing over 100 pounds. A single flaw in the mirror's surface could render a multi-million-candlepower searchlight useless. During night battles in the Solomons, damaged searchlight mirrors became critical shortages—American destroyers sometimes operated with only one or two functional searchlights instead of their designed complement of four to six, severely limiting their ability to illuminate Japanese torpedo boats during night actions.

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Optical coating facilities with vacuum chambers | High | 3-7 units |
| Purchase | Specialized optical suppliers, naval repair yards | Medium | 1-15 units |
| Salvage | Damaged searchlights, periscope assemblies | Medium | 1-4 units |
| Quest Reward | Night combat equipment missions | Medium | 2-5 units |

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~36 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +45% at forward Pacific bases, +35% at submarine repair facilities, -10% near major manufacturing hubs |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Carl Zeiss), USA (Corning, Pittsburgh Plate Glass), UK (Pilkington), Japan (limited production)
- **Major Consumers**: Destroyer squadrons, submarine forces, night fighting vessels, coastal defense searchlight batteries
- **Bottlenecks**: Vacuum coating equipment, specialized metallic coatings (rhodium, silver), skilled mirror silvering technicians, environmental degradation requiring frequent replacement

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Optical mirrors are essential for night combat operations and submarine warfare. Without functional mirrors, searchlights cannot illuminate enemy vessels, periscopes lose their effectiveness, and signal lamps fail. The marine environment's corrosive effects mean mirrors require constant replacement, creating ongoing demand that strains supply chains. Night surface actions in the Pacific demonstrated that a single functional searchlight with a quality mirror could determine battle outcomes, making mirrors critical consumables for destroyer and cruiser forces.
