## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision celestial navigation instruments for determining position at sea. Essential equipment for navigators to shoot star and sun sights for accurate position fixing.

---

## Lore

Despite the advent of radio direction finding and primitive radar, celestial navigation remained the primary means of determining precise position at sea throughout WW2. The sextant—a precision instrument unchanged in principle since the 18th century—allowed navigators to measure the angle between celestial bodies and the horizon, translating those measurements into position fixes accurate within a few miles. Every warship from destroyer to battleship required functional sextants, and navigators treated them with reverence bordering on superstition.

German surface raiders like Atlantis and Kormoran operated for months in remote oceans, relying entirely on celestial navigation to avoid detection while hunting Allied shipping. Their navigators became legendary for maintaining precise positions despite weeks without landfall or radio fixes. American submarine skippers in the Pacific learned that Japanese anti-submarine patrols often focused on known navigation waypoints, making accurate celestial navigation—and thus reliable sextants—critical for survival. USS Wahoo's aggressive patrolling was enabled partly by her navigator's exceptional celestial navigation skills, allowing the boat to operate confidently in poorly charted waters.

The British Royal Navy standardized on Hughes sextants for general use, though many navigators purchased superior instruments from personal funds. During the evacuation of Crete, accurate navigation using sextants allowed destroyer squadrons to navigate treacherous waters at high speed during darkness, avoiding both German airfields and underwater hazards. When HMS Illustrious limped toward Alexandria after the Malta attacks, her navigator used sextant fixes to plot the safest course through Axis-controlled waters, maintaining positioning accuracy despite damaged gyrocompasses and electrical failures.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Precision instrument makers | Medium | 2-6 units |
| Purchase | Naval suppliers, navigation equipment shops | Low | 1-10 units |
| Salvage | Damaged bridges, captured vessels | Low | 1-5 units |
| Quest Reward | Navigation missions | Low | 2-8 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Not typically crafted further; end-use navigation instrument
- **Construction**: Bridge navigation stations, chart rooms, lifeboat equipment
- **Consumable**: Standard navigation equipment; enables celestial position fixing and safe navigation
- **Trade**: Universal naval demand; steady market; common but quality variants command premiums

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Mirrors (2 units), Lenses (1 unit), Precision arc/frame | Precision assembly & calibration | Sextants (1 unit) | Precision Instrument Workshop |
| Sextants, Carrying case & maintenance kit | Packaging | Navigation Kit | Basic Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~165 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Low |
| **Regional Variance** | +30% at remote Pacific bases, +15% at forward locations, -5% at major ports with instrument makers |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: UK (Hughes, traditional naval instrument makers), USA (adequate wartime production), Germany (excellent precision instruments), Japan (domestic production adequate)
- **Major Consumers**: All naval vessels (navigation departments), merchant marine, lifeboat equipment, coastal navigation stations
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision mirror and arc production, skilled instrument makers for calibration, protective cases and maintenance equipment

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐

Sextants are essential navigation equipment for all vessels operating beyond coastal waters. Without reliable sextants, ships cannot accurately determine position when radio navigation is unavailable or undesirable (radio silence). While not as dramatic as fire control equipment, sextants enable the fundamental naval operation of knowing where you are—critical for safe navigation, rendezvous, and operational planning.
