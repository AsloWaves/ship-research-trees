## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Precision gyroscopic compass systems that maintain true heading regardless of ship motion. Critical for accurate fire control and navigation in combat conditions.

---

## Lore

Gyrocompasses represent the pinnacle of naval navigation technology. Unlike magnetic compasses, gyrocompasses maintain true north through mechanical gyroscopic stabilization, unaffected by ship's roll, pitch, or magnetic interference from steel hulls. They are essential for modern fire control systems, enabling accurate long-range gunnery. The Sperry Gyroscope Company dominates Allied production, while German manufacturers produce the renowned Anschutz models. Each capital ship requires multiple units for redundancy, making them expensive and sought-after salvage. A functional gyrocompass recovered from a wreck can offset an entire salvage operation's costs.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Salvage | Cruiser/Battleship wrecks | Hard | 1-2 units |
| Purchase | Major naval ports | N/A | Limited stock |
| Raid | Enemy supply convoys | Very Hard | 1 unit |
| Quest Reward | High-tier missions | N/A | 1 unit |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Required for advanced fire control systems, torpedo directors, and main battery rangefinders
- **Construction**: Essential for cruiser-class and larger vessels, high-end destroyer upgrades
- **Consumable**: Not consumed directly, but can fail and require replacement
- **Trade**: High-value trade commodity, significant markup in blockaded regions, constant demand

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Precision Machinery x3, Optical Glass x2, Electrical Components x1 | Manufacture | Gyrocompasses x1 | Advanced Manufacturing Facility |
| Damaged Gyrocompass x2, Precision Parts x1 | Rebuild | Gyrocompasses x1 | Specialized Workshop |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1300 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Medium |
| **Regional Variance** | +40% in Pacific theaters, +60% in blockaded ports, -15% in US/UK home ports |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: USA (Sperry), UK (S.G. Brown), Germany (Anschutz), limited Japanese production
- **Major Consumers**: Naval shipyards, repair facilities, fire control system manufacturers
- **Bottlenecks**: Precision machining capacity, specialized skilled labor, optical glass shortages

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Gyrocompasses are force multipliers for capital ships. Without them, long-range gunnery accuracy drops precipitously, negating the advantage of superior firepower. A battleship with failed gyrocompasses fights at half effectiveness. Nations guard gyrocompass production facilities heavily, and sabotage operations frequently target them. Control of gyrocompass supply chains can determine regional naval supremacy. Their high value makes them priority salvage targets, often worth more than the fuel expended to recover them.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Common | 100% | Sperry production meets domestic needs |
| United Kingdom | Common | 110% | S.G. Brown quality premium |
| Japan | Scarce | 140% | Limited domestic production, import dependent |
| Germany | Rare | 95% | Anschutz excellence, but disrupted by war |
