## Description

> *Brief in-game description displayed in inventory tooltips.*

Complete periscope optical assemblies for submarine observation. Sealed prism and mirror systems that allow submerged vessels to observe the surface while maintaining stealth.

## Lore

The submarine periscope represented one of warfare's most elegant engineering solutions—allowing a vessel to observe the surface world while remaining hidden beneath the waves. Unlike surface ship optics, periscope systems had to function in conditions no other instrument faced: submerged in seawater, extended through pressure hulls, subjected to depth charge concussions, and required to provide crystal-clear optics despite passing through a thin tube barely six inches in diameter.

German U-boat periscopes set the technological standard, using sophisticated prism arrangements that folded light paths multiple times within minimal space. The Zeiss periscope head incorporated anti-reflection coatings and rhodium-plated mirrors that resisted salt corrosion far better than Allied equivalents. American submarine skippers operating in the Pacific quickly learned that Japanese depth charge attacks could jar periscope optics out of alignment even when the boat wasn't directly hit—a cracked prism or misaligned mirror meant operating blind until reaching a repair facility.

Periscope optical assemblies became priority salvage targets. When USS Squalus sank in 1939 during trials, Navy salvage teams specifically recovered her intact periscope optics for analysis and reuse. Japanese submarine construction was perpetually bottlenecked by periscope production—their limited optical manufacturing capacity meant new boats sometimes waited months for periscope installations. British X-craft midget submarines used miniaturized periscope optics that represented the absolute pinnacle of optical miniaturization, with each unit hand-assembled by master craftsmen and worth more than its weight in gold.

## Game Mechanics

### Acquisition Methods

| Method | Location | Difficulty | Yield |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Production | Specialized submarine equipment facilities | Very High | 1-2 units |
| Purchase | Submarine bases, major naval arsenals | High | 1-5 units |
| Salvage | Damaged submarines, captured periscope equipment | Very High | 1 unit |
| Quest Reward | Submarine warfare missions | High | 1-3 units |

### Primary Uses

- **Crafting**: Complete periscope assemblies (with mechanical tubes and housings)
- **Construction**: Submarine attack periscopes, search periscopes, observation periscopes, midget submarine optics
- **Consumable**: Direct replacement for damaged periscope systems; critical for submarine operations
- **Trade**: Extremely high demand from submarine forces; limited supply creates premium prices at all locations

### Processing & Refinement

| Input | Process | Output | Facility Required |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Prisms (6 units), Mirrors (3 units), Lenses (4 units) | Precision assembly & sealing | Periscope Optics (1 unit) | Submarine Equipment Workshop |
| Periscope Optics (1 unit), Pressure-resistant tube | Integration & waterproofing | Complete Periscope Assembly (1 unit) | Submarine Construction Facility |

## Economic Impact

### Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Base Value** | ~1250 credits |
| **Price Volatility** | Very High |
| **Regional Variance** | +120% at forward submarine bases, +90% in Pacific theater, +70% at repair facilities, -15% at major German/US submarine construction yards |

### Supply Chain

- **Primary Producers**: Germany (Zeiss, world-leading submarine optics), USA (Kollmorgen Optical, Electric Boat Company), UK (Barr & Stroud submarine division), Japan (severely limited production)
- **Major Consumers**: Submarine forces (2-3 periscopes per boat), submarine repair yards, new submarine construction programs
- **Bottlenecks**: Extreme precision requirements, waterproofing and pressure-sealing challenges, miniaturization complexity, months-long assembly time, post-damage replacement difficulties

### Strategic Importance

**Military Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Economic Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Scarcity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Periscope optics are absolutely critical for submarine warfare. A submarine with damaged periscope optics cannot safely operate—it's effectively blind and must either surface (risking detection and attack) or navigate submerged without observation capability. Unlike surface ships that can continue operations with degraded optics, submarines with periscope damage must immediately abort their patrol and return to a major base for repairs. The manufacturing complexity and extreme scarcity make periscope optics among the most valuable naval resources in the game.

## Faction Variations

| Faction | Availability | Price Modifier | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| United States | Limited | Base price | Kollmorgen production adequate for fleet boats; good quality |
| United Kingdom | Scarce | +20% | Excellent Barr & Stroud quality but production limited; prioritizes new construction |
| Japan | Very Scarce | +70% | Severe production bottleneck; submarines often delayed awaiting periscope optics |
| Germany | Limited | -20% | Zeiss excellence in submarine optics; finest available but Allied bombing impacts production |
