# Short-Base Rangefinder

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-002 |
| **Era** | 1900+ |
| **Category** | Detection-Visual |
| **Weight** | 150 kg |
| **Power Draw** | None |

## Description

Compact 1-2 meter coincidence rangefinder designed for small warships. The operator views two images of the target through split optics and adjusts a calibrated dial until the images align. The instrument directly reads the range. Short-base rangefinders sacrifice accuracy for portability and speed of operation.

These instruments were standard equipment on destroyers, torpedo boats, and small cruisers where space and weight were critical. While less accurate than the massive stereoscopic rangefinders on capital ships, they provided sufficient precision for short-range combat and were far better than estimation.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Range Display**: Shows target range with ±500 yard accuracy
- **Quick Ranging**: 3-second measurement time
- **Fire Control Input**: Feeds data to gun directors
- **No Power Required**: Purely optical system

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base Length | 1-2 meters |
| Accuracy (ideal) | ±500 yards |
| Accuracy (10km) | ±700 yards |
| Accuracy (15km+) | ±1000 yards |
| Maximum Range | 18,000 m |
| Measurement Time | 3 seconds |
| Weather Penalty | +300 yards error (haze/rain) |
| Motion Penalty | +200 yards error (high speed) |

## Advantages

- Lightweight and compact
- No power requirements
- Quick operation
- Easy to train operators
- Reliable in all conditions
- Sufficient for destroyer combat ranges
- Can be backup for main rangefinder

## Disadvantages

- Lower accuracy than long-base types
- Limited maximum range
- Degraded by poor visibility
- Requires clear line of sight
- Cannot penetrate smoke
- Accuracy decreases with range
- Single point of failure if damaged

## Historical Notes

Short-base rangefinders were ubiquitous on destroyers throughout the first half of the 20th century. Japanese destroyers carried particularly good instruments, contributing to their effectiveness in night actions. The typical destroyer rangefinder was 1.5m coincidence type, mounted on the bridge or gun director.

During WWII, destroyer rangefinders proved adequate for their typical engagement ranges of 5-12km. At the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, USS O'Bannon used her rangefinder to engage IJN Hiei at close range with devastating accuracy. The instruments remained standard until radar fire-control became reliable in the late 1940s.

## Tactical Tips

- Most accurate at ranges under 10km
- Take multiple readings and average them
- Crew skill significantly affects accuracy
- Use in conjunction with fall-of-shot correction
- Essential for ships without fire-control radar
- Keep backup rangefinder if possible
- Night accuracy severely degraded - use searchlights or star shells
- Train crews regularly to maintain proficiency
