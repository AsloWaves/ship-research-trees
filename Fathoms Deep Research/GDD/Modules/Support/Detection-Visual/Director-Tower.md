# Director Tower

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-004 |
| **Era** | 1920+ |
| **Category** | Detection-Visual |
| **Weight** | 8,000 kg |

## Description

Elevated fire control platform combining long-base rangefinders, optical sights, and mechanical computers. The director tower allows centralized control of the main battery - one officer aims for all guns, ensuring coordinated salvos. The elevated position provides better visibility and reduces interference from gun smoke and spray.

The director concept revolutionized naval gunnery. Rather than each gun turret aiming independently, the director crew tracks the target and calculates firing solutions, transmitting data electrically to all turrets. This produces tight, concentrated salvos for better spotting and increased hit probability.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed with Main Battery Director System:
- **Centralized Fire Control**: All guns fire together with one solution
- **Salvo Accuracy**: +25% accuracy bonus
- **Elevated Position**: +15% visual detection range
- **Spotting Advantage**: Superior fall-of-shot observation
- **Quick Target Switching**: Faster engagement of new targets

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Rangefinder | 8-12m integral unit |
| Elevation | 15-20m above deck |
| Accuracy Bonus | +25% main battery accuracy |
| Detection Bonus | +15% visual range |
| Crew Required | 6 (director officer, rangefinder operators, plotters) |
| Armor | 25-100mm (varies by ship class) |
| Target Tracking | ±15 degrees/second |
| Rangefinding Rate | Continuous tracking |

## Advantages

- Dramatically improves salvo accuracy
- Centralized fire control is faster and more efficient
- Elevated position sees over spray and smoke
- Better target observation for fall-of-shot correction
- Can direct both main and secondary batteries
- Protected by armor
- Essential for modern gunnery tactics
- Enables long-range accurate fire

## Disadvantages

- Heavy (affects ship top-weight)
- High and visible (easy target for enemy)
- Expensive and complex
- Single point of failure - if destroyed, gunnery coordination lost
- Blast from own guns can damage sensitive instruments
- Requires extensive crew training
- Power required for electrical transmission system

## Historical Notes

Director towers transformed naval combat. HMS Dreadnought (1906) introduced the concept, but true director control emerged around 1912-1915. At Jutland, British ships with effective directors scored significantly more hits than those relying on turret-level control.

American Mk 37 directors on WWII destroyers and cruisers were particularly effective, combining radar and optical systems. Japanese pagoda masts featured massive director towers - sometimes multiple levels - though these made ships top-heavy. The German Zeiss fire control directors were renowned for precision.

By 1945, directors integrated radar, analog computers, and optical systems. Post-war, they remained relevant until missile systems made gun directors less critical in the 1970s-80s.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential for competitive gunnery beyond 12km
- Director destruction severely degrades combat effectiveness
- Protect with smoke if under fire
- Can control multiple turrets simultaneously
- Works best with gyro-stabilized platforms (later versions)
- Train backup crews in case of casualties
- Combine with radar for all-weather capability
- The elevated position makes you visible - consider implications
- In close combat, elevation advantage is reduced
