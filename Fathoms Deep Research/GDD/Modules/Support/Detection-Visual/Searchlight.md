# Searchlight

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-001 |
| **Era** | 1890+ |
| **Category** | Detection-Visual |
| **Weight** | 800 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 50 kW |

## Description

Powerful carbon-arc or incandescent lamp with focusing mirror and directional mount. Searchlights project intense beams up to 5 kilometers, illuminating targets for night combat. The powerful beam can blind enemy lookouts and reveal targets for gunnery, but also advertises your position to every ship in the area.

Early searchlights used carbon-arc technology requiring constant maintenance. Later models employed high-intensity incandescent bulbs. Modern infrared searchlights provide illumination visible only through night-vision equipment, though these are rare on surface combatants.

## Effect on Gameplay

When activated:
- **Target Illumination**: Reveals enemies within 5km cone
- **Night Combat**: Enables accurate gunnery at night
- **Enemy Detection**: +100% visual detection in beam
- **Position Revealed**: YOUR position visible to all within 20km
- **Crew Blinding**: Can temporarily blind enemy lookouts

## Specifications

## Advantages

- Enables night combat beyond star-shell range
- Can blind enemy optically-aimed weapons
- Useful for identifying neutrals before engaging
- Essential for torpedo boat defense
- Can assist in rescue operations

## Disadvantages

- Reveals your exact position when used
- Makes your ship a priority target
- High power consumption
- Carbon-arc types require frequent maintenance
- Can be damaged by enemy fire easily
- Useless in fog or heavy weather

## Historical Notes

Searchlights were critical for night combat in the pre-radar era. At the Battle of Savo Island (1942), Japanese cruisers used searchlights to devastating effect, illuminating Allied ships moments before opening fire. The British used searchlights extensively at Jutland (1916) for night identification. However, searchlight-equipped ships often drew concentrated fire - the HMS Warspite was repeatedly targeted when her searchlights were active.

By WWII, searchlight use declined as radar provided detection without revealing position. Modern navies rarely use searchlights for combat, reserving them for identification and rescue operations.

## Tactical Tips

- Only activate when ready to fire immediately
- Use sparingly - every second active increases danger
- Coordinate with allies: one ship illuminates, another shoots
- Consider using star shells instead for indirect illumination
- Turn off immediately after target acquisition
- Mount multiple lights to illuminate different sectors simultaneously
- In multiplayer, illuminating reveals BOTH ships to all players
