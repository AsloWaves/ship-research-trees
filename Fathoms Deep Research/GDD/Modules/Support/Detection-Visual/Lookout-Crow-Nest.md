# Crow's Nest Lookout

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-003 |
| **Era** | 1890+ |
| **Detection Range** | 18 km (day) |
| **Coverage** | 360° |

## Description
Elevated observation platform mounted high on the mainmast or foremast. The increased height extends the visual horizon, allowing earlier detection of distant vessels. Historically the primary lookout position on sailing vessels, it remained valuable on steam warships despite the exposure and discomfort for the crew.

## Detection Performance
| Condition | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clear day | 18 km | +20% from elevation |
| Hazy | 12 km | Still benefits from height |
| Night (moonlit) | 2.4 km | Sees farther over waves |
| Night (dark) | 1 km | Minimal benefit at night |
| Storm | 4 km | Very difficult conditions |

## Effect on Fog of War
- Extended horizon distance from elevation
- Spots distant smoke first
- Can see over nearby swells/waves
- First warning of approaching contacts
- Height advantage reveals hull-down targets

## Advantages
- Maximum visual range for given optics
- Extended horizon distance
- Can see over intervening wave tops
- Classic and proven design
- Early warning system

## Disadvantages
- Extremely exposed to weather
- Crew fatigue in rough seas
- Motion sickness common
- Vulnerable to shrapnel
- Difficult communication to bridge
- Storm conditions nearly unusable

## Historical Notes
The crow's nest dates to the age of sail, when lookouts climbed to platforms high on the masts. Even on steel battleships, elevated lookouts provided crucial early warning. HMS Hood's lookouts spotted Bismarck from the foretop. However, the exposed position was dangerous - spray, wind, and cold made it a miserable posting. Japanese lookouts in elevated positions were legendary for their keen eyesight and endurance.
