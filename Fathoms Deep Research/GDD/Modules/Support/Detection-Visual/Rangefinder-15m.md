# 15m Optical Rangefinder

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-008 |
| **Era** | 1930+ |
| **Detection Range** | 30 km (day) |
| **Coverage** | 90° (directed) |

## Description
The ultimate optical rangefinder, epitomized by the massive 15-meter instruments on Yamato and Musashi. The extreme baseline length provides unmatched accuracy at very long range, theoretically enabling precise gunnery at distances exceeding 30 km. A triumph of optical engineering, though rendered obsolescent by radar fire control.

## Detection Performance
| Condition | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clear day | 30 km | Beyond typical visual horizon |
| Hazy | 20 km | Still excellent |
| Night (moonlit) | 4 km | Best night performance |
| Night (dark) | 1.5 km | Better than smaller units |
| Storm | 10 km | Well-protected optics |

## Rangefinding Performance
| Range | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 15 km | ±10m | Pinpoint accuracy |
| 20 km | ±20m | Excellent |
| 25 km | ±30m | Very good |
| 30 km | ±45m | Still accurate |
| 35 km | ±40m | Maximum effective range |
| 40 km+ | ±100m+ | Theoretical limit |

## Effect on Fog of War
- Maximum optical ranging capability
- Enables ultra-long-range gunnery
- Unmatched precision for optical systems
- Can range targets near/at horizon
- Provides fire control data at extreme distances

## Advantages
- Best optical ranging accuracy possible
- 15m baseline maximizes precision
- Can range at distances radar struggled with (early war)
- Japanese optics were world-class quality
- Multiple operators cross-check readings
- Excellent light-gathering capability

## Disadvantages
- Extremely heavy (serious topweight)
- Very expensive to manufacture
- Requires elite, specially-trained crew
- Vulnerable to shock and damage
- Long baseline difficult to keep aligned
- Rendered obsolete by radar
- Only on largest battleships

## Historical Notes
The 15m rangefinder represents the pinnacle of optical fire control technology. Yamato and Musashi mounted 15m rangefinders in their massive pagoda-style bridge structures. Japanese optical manufacturing (particularly Nikko) was world-renowned, and these instruments were considered the finest ever built. However, by the time they entered service (1941-42), radar fire control was emerging. The Americans noted with interest that Yamato's optical systems were superb, but her lack of modern radar fire control was a critical weakness. The 15m rangefinders never got to demonstrate their theoretical capability in battleship-vs-battleship combat at extreme range.
