# 60-inch Searchlight

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | VIS-010 |
| **Era** | 1920+ |
| **Detection Range** | 8 km (night illumination) |
| **Coverage** | 25° beam |

## Description
Heavy naval searchlight with 60-inch (152cm) diameter mirror, typically mounted on capital ships and large cruisers. Projects an extremely powerful beam capable of illuminating targets at considerable distance. The largest practical searchlight size for naval use, providing maximum night-fighting capability before radar.

## Detection Performance
| Condition | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clear night | 8 km | Intense illumination |
| Hazy night | 5 km | Scatter reduces range |
| Moonlit | 10 km | Enhanced by moonlight |
| Storm | 3 km | Rain scatters beam |
| Fog | 1.5 km | Poor performance |

## Illumination Performance
| Range | Effect | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 2 km | Brilliant illumination | Can dazzle enemy crew |
| 5 km | Full illumination | Clear target identification |
| 8 km | Good illumination | Gunnery possible |
| 10 km | Marginal | Silhouette only |

## Effect on Fog of War
- Illuminates distant targets at night
- Enables long-range night gunnery
- VERY prominent beacon (highly visible)
- Can dazzle enemy optically-aimed weapons
- Allows visual identification at extended range

## Advantages
- Maximum illumination range
- Very bright beam
- Can reach destroyer-scale targets at 8+ km
- Effective for night gunnery
- Can illuminate aircraft (AA role)
- Intimidation factor

## Disadvantages
- EXTREMELY visible (massive tactical liability)
- Very heavy power consumption
- Heavy weight and size
- Requires dedicated mounting
- Priority target for enemy gunfire
- Narrow beam (must aim precisely)
- Obsolete with radar

## Historical Notes
The 60-inch searchlight represented the peak of naval illumination technology. British battleships and cruisers mounted these massive lights for night actions. HMS Hood carried multiple 60-inch searchlights. The Imperial Japanese Navy also invested heavily in large searchlights for their night-fighting doctrine. However, combat experience quickly showed the deadly risk - activating searchlights made ships easy targets. At the Battle of Cape Matapan (1941), Italian cruisers illuminated by British searchlights were devastated by point-blank fire. By mid-WWII, radar made searchlights obsolete for surface combat, though they remained useful for signaling and anti-aircraft illumination.
