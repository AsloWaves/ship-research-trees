# Lookout Station

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SUP-001 |
| **Era** | All Eras |
| **Category** | Detection |
| **Weight** | 500 kg |
| **Power Draw** | None |
| **Crew Required** | 4 lookouts |

## Description

Dedicated observation positions with optical equipment (binoculars, telescopes). Trained lookouts scan assigned sectors for surface contacts, aircraft, periscopes, and torpedo wakes. The Mk 1 Eyeball remains effective even in the radar age.

## Effect on Fog of War

```
Base Visual Range:     12 km (clear day)
Range (poor weather):  3-6 km
Range (night):         1-3 km
Range (fog):           0.5-1 km
Sector Coverage:       360° continuous
```

## Detection Capabilities

| Target Type | Detection Range | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Battleship | 20+ km | Smoke visible far |
| Cruiser | 15-18 km | Superstructure |
| Destroyer | 10-12 km | Smaller profile |
| Submarine (surfaced) | 8-10 km | Low profile |
| Periscope | 2-4 km | Very difficult |
| Torpedo wake | 1-2 km | Critical warning |
| Aircraft | 15-20 km | Depends on altitude |

## Upgrades

Can be improved by:
- **Crew Training**: +10% range per skill level
- **Better Optics**: +15% range (interwar+)
- **Elevated Position**: +20% range (crow's nest)

## Stacking

Multiple Lookout Stations provide:
- First station: Full effect
- Second station: +25% detection chance
- Third+: Diminishing returns

## Historical Notes

Despite radar, lookouts remained essential throughout WWII and beyond. Radar cannot see everything - periscopes, floating mines, survivors in the water, and small craft often require visual detection. Japanese lookouts were legendarily skilled, often detecting enemies before radar.

## Limitations

- Weather dependent
- Requires alert crew (fatigue matters)
- Cannot see over horizon
- Night capability very limited

## Compatible With

- All Bridge types
- No power requirements
- Any era ship
