# Floatplane Catapult

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SUP-021 |
| **Era** | 1920-1950 |
| **Category** | Special |
| **Weight** | 15,000 kg |
| **Crew Required** | 6 (+ aircrew) |

## Description

Catapult system for launching reconnaissance floatplanes. The aircraft extends the ship's vision beyond the horizon, spots for gunnery, and can search for enemies. Recovery by crane after water landing.

## Effect on Fog of War

**Extends your vision dramatically!**

```
Scout Range:          100+ km from ship
Spot Duration:        2-4 hours
Vision Radius:        20 km around aircraft
Report Delay:         Radio = instant
                      Visual signals = 30 sec
```

## Effect on UI

When launched with Director Bridge+:
- **Extended Minimap**: See where plane is
- **Contact Reports**: Aircraft spots enemies
- **Fall-of-Shot Spotting**: Gunnery correction
- **Temporary Vision**: Circle around aircraft position

## Aircraft Types

| Aircraft | Nation | Range | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| SOC Seagull | USA | 1000 km | Standard US scout |
| OS2U Kingfisher | USA | 1300 km | Improved scout |
| Arado Ar 196 | Germany | 1100 km | Armed scout |
| E13A "Jake" | Japan | 2100 km | Long-range |
| Walrus | UK | 960 km | Versatile |

## Capabilities

### Scouting
- Search beyond horizon
- Report enemy composition
- Track enemy movements
- Find survivors

### Gunnery Spotting
- Observe fall of shot
- Radio corrections
- Enable hits at extreme range
- Critical for battleship duels

## Limitations

- Weather dependent (no launch in storms)
- Vulnerable to enemy fighters
- Recovery takes time (must slow down)
- Limited aircraft (usually 1-4)
- Obsolete after radar widespread

## Operations

```
Launch Time:          2 minutes
Recovery Time:        10 minutes (crane)
Turnaround:           30 minutes (rearm/refuel)
Aircraft per Ship:    1-4 depending on size
```

## Historical Notes

Floatplane scouts were essential before radar. At Jutland, aircraft could have warned of the German fleet. By WWII, battleships and cruisers routinely carried scouts. The Battle of the River Plate saw British cruisers using aircraft to track Graf Spee. Radar eventually made scouts less critical.

## Obsolescence

Radar (1940+) provides:
- All-weather operation
- No aircraft risk
- Instant updates
- 24/7 availability

Floatplanes remained useful for:
- Rescue operations
- Shore bombardment spotting
- Areas without radar

## Compatible With

- Director Bridge+
- CIC Bridge
- Cruisers and Battleships primarily
