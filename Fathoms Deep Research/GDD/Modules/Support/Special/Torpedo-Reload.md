# Torpedo Reload System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-007 |
| **Era** | 1900-Present |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 10,000 kg (magazine + equipment) |
| **Power Draw** | 10 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 6 (torpedo crew) |

## Description

Magazine storage and handling system for torpedo reloads. Stores additional torpedoes in protected magazines and provides hoists, trolleys, and loading equipment to reload torpedo tubes after initial salvo is fired. Transforms single-shot torpedo batteries into sustained-fire weapons, dramatically increasing ship's offensive capability.

## Effect on Gameplay

Enables multiple torpedo attacks instead of single salvo. After firing tubes, crew can reload from magazine and fire again. Critical for prolonged combat or multiple engagements. Ships without reloads are severely limited in torpedo actions - one salvo and done. With reloads, you can engage multiple targets or make repeated attacks on a single tough target.

## Specifications

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Reload Capacity** | 4-20 torpedoes (ship size dependent) |
| **Storage Location** | Below-deck magazines |
| **Reload Time** | 5-15 minutes per tube |
| **Handling Equipment** | Hoists, trolleys, loading rails |
| **Torpedo Types** | All standard shipboard torpedoes |
| **Safety Systems** | Fireproof doors, flooding capability |
| **Power Requirement** | 10 kW (hoists and handling) |

## System Components

### Torpedo Magazine
- **Protected storage**: Armored magazine below waterline
- **Capacity**: 4-20 torpedo reloads
- **Racks**: Secure torpedo storage
- **Climate control**: Temperature/humidity regulation
- **Ventilation**: Remove battery gas (electric torpedoes)
- **Lighting**: Safe illumination (no sparks)
- **Flooding system**: Emergency magazine flooding

### Handling Equipment
- **Electric hoists**: Lift torpedoes from magazine
- **Transfer trolleys**: Move torpedoes horizontally
- **Loading rails**: Guide torpedo into tube
- **Roller conveyors**: Reduce friction
- **Locking mechanisms**: Secure torpedoes during handling
- **Alignment guides**: Proper positioning for loading

### Safety Systems
- **Fireproof doors**: Isolate magazine from rest of ship
- **Flooding valves**: Emergency water admission
- **Temperature monitoring**: Detect fires early
- **Gas detection**: Hydrogen from batteries (old)
- **Sprinkler systems**: Fire suppression
- **Emergency lighting**: Backup power

## Reload Procedure

### Manual Reload (WWII Era)
1. **Open tube breach**: Access rear of torpedo tube
2. **Extract cradle**: Pull loading tray from magazine
3. **Move torpedo**: Trolley or hand-carry to tube
4. **Align**: Position torpedo with tube
5. **Push torpedo**: Manually shove into tube
6. **Secure**: Lock torpedo in tube
7. **Close breach**: Seal tube
8. **Reconnect**: Electrical and impulse air connections
9. **Test**: Verify systems functional
10. **Ready**: Tube ready to fire
- **Time**: 10-15 minutes per tube with trained crew

### Powered Reload (Modern)
1. **Select torpedo**: Choose from magazine inventory
2. **Hoist**: Electric lift brings torpedo to tube level
3. **Transfer**: Power trolley moves to tube
4. **Automatic loading**: Power ram inserts torpedo
5. **System connection**: Automatic hookup
6. **Computer check**: Verify torpedo systems
7. **Ready**: Tube ready to fire
- **Time**: 5-8 minutes per tube

## Reload Capacity by Ship Type

### Destroyers (WWI-WWII)
- **Tubes**: 4-12 tubes
- **Reloads**: 0-8 torpedoes
- **Total capacity**: 12-20 torpedoes
- **Volleys**: 1-2 full salvos

### Light Cruisers
- **Tubes**: 6-8 tubes
- **Reloads**: 4-8 torpedoes
- **Total capacity**: 10-16 torpedoes
- **Volleys**: 2 full salvos

### Heavy Cruisers
- **Tubes**: 8-12 tubes (if carried)
- **Reloads**: 4-12 torpedoes
- **Total capacity**: 12-24 torpedoes
- **Volleys**: 2-3 full salvos

### Torpedo Boats
- **Tubes**: 2-4 tubes
- **Reloads**: 0-2 torpedoes
- **Total capacity**: 2-6 torpedoes
- **Volleys**: 1-2 salvos

### Submarines
- **Tubes**: 4-10 tubes
- **Reloads**: 8-20 torpedoes
- **Total capacity**: 20-30 torpedoes
- **Volleys**: 3-5 full salvos

## Tactical Applications

### Sustained Engagement
- Fire initial salvo
- Reload while assessing results
- Fire second salvo
- Enables prolonged combat

### Multiple Targets
- Engage first target
- Reload
- Engage second target
- Effective use of limited firepower

### Saturation Attack
- Fire all tubes
- Immediate reload
- Second massive salvo
- Overwhelming defense

### Reserve Capability
- Hold reloads for critical moment
- Fire, assess, reload, finish off
- Flexibility in engagement

## Advantages

- Multiplies torpedo firepower (2-3x combat capacity)
- Enables engagement of multiple targets
- Provides second chance if first salvo misses
- Sustained combat capability
- Flexibility in ammunition selection
- Essential for serious torpedo armament
- Force multiplication for small ships
- Enables prolonged night actions

## Limitations

- Heavy (reduces speed or armor allocation)
- Volumetrically expensive (large magazines)
- Fire/explosion vulnerability
- Reload time leaves ship vulnerable (not shooting)
- Requires skilled torpedo crew
- Magazine can be damaged by battle damage
- Torpedoes expensive (losing ship = losing torpedo investment)
- Slower reload under combat stress
- Exposed deck crew during reload (danger)

## Reload Under Fire

Reloading during combat is hazardous:
- **Exposed crew**: Torpedo crews vulnerable to fire
- **Slow process**: 10-15 minutes of vulnerability
- **Magazine access**: Doors open = fire risk
- **Concentration needed**: Errors dangerous
- **Training critical**: Speed comes from practice

Japanese destroyer crews trained extensively in night reload drills, achieving remarkable speed. U.S. Navy found combat reloading difficult under pressure.

## Without Reloads

Ships lacking reload capacity:
- One-shot torpedo armament
- Must break off after initial attack
- Cannot engage multiple targets
- Limited tactical flexibility
- Reduced threat level (enemy knows limited ammunition)
- Significant disadvantage vs. ships with reloads

## Historical Notes

Early torpedo vessels had minimal reloads - weight and space constraints limited capacity. WWI destroyers typically carried 1:1 tubes to torpedoes (no reloads). Experience showed this was inadequate - single volleys rarely scored hits, and ships were left defenseless.

WWII saw emphasis on reloads. Japanese destroyers famously trained for rapid reload of their excellent Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedoes. Japanese doctrine called for multi-salvo night attacks, reloading between volleys. The emphasis on reload capacity contributed to Japanese destroyer success in night actions like Savo Island and Tassafaronga.

U.S. destroyers increased reload capacity during the war. Early destroyers had limited reloads; later ships carried more. The Fletcher-class typically had 10 tubes plus 5 reloads (15 total torpedoes). Some late-war ships sacrificed tubes for reloads (fewer tubes, more torpedoes per tube).

Reloading under fire proved difficult. Several U.S. destroyers were hit while reloading torpedoes - IJNS Fubuki at Cape Esperance (1942) was caught reloading and quickly destroyed. The vulnerability of reload operations led some navies to favor one massive initial salvo over planned reloads.

Post-war, heavyweight torpedoes remained important for submarines and some surface ships. Modern destroyers and frigates carry limited torpedoes (4-8 total), relying on other weapons for surface combat. Submarines still carry substantial torpedo loads with reloads - Virginia-class has 12 tubes worth of torpedoes/missiles with reloads for total capacity up to 40.
