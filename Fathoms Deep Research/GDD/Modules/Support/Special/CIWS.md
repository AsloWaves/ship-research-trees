# CIWS (Close-In Weapon System)

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPL-003 |
| **Era** | 1970+ |
| **Category** | Special |
| **Weight** | 6,200 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 50 kW |

## Description

Automated rapid-fire gun system for last-ditch anti-missile and anti-aircraft defense. CIWS (pronounced "sea-whiz") systems like the US Phalanx or Dutch Goalkeeper employ radar-directed Gatling guns firing 3000-4500 rounds per minute of depleted uranium or tungsten projectiles. The system operates autonomously, detecting incoming threats, calculating intercept solutions, and engaging without human intervention - critical given the brief reaction time against anti-ship missiles.

The self-contained system integrates search radar, tracking radar, fire control computer, and rotary cannon. Modern CIWS can engage sea-skimming missiles, aircraft, and even small boats. The system provides the final defensive layer when long-range missiles (SAMs) and medium-range guns fail to stop incoming threats.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed and activated:
- **Automated Point Defense**: Engages missiles within 1500m automatically
- **High Kill Probability**: 70-90% vs. subsonic missiles
- **Anti-Aircraft**: Effective vs. helicopters and low-flying aircraft
- **Surface Targets**: Can engage small boats
- **No Crew Input Required**: Fully autonomous operation
- **Last Defense Layer**: Engages threats that penetrate other defenses

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Gun Caliber | 20mm (Phalanx) or 30mm (Goalkeeper) |
| Rate of Fire | 3000-4500 rounds/minute |
| Effective Range | 500-1500m |
| Ammunition Capacity | 1550 rounds (Phalanx) |
| Target Tracking | Simultaneous multi-target |
| Reaction Time | <2 seconds |
| Kill Probability | 70-90% per engagement |
| Engagement Envelope | 360 degrees (mount dependent) |

## Advantages

- Fully automated (no crew aiming required)
- Extremely high rate of fire
- Last-ditch defense when SAMs fail
- Effective vs. sea-skimming missiles
- Quick reaction time (<2 seconds)
- Self-contained (radar, gun, computer integrated)
- Can engage multiple threats sequentially
- Proven combat effectiveness
- Works vs. aircraft and surface threats
- No missile reload required (gun ammunition)

## Disadvantages

- Very short range (last-ditch only)
- Limited ammunition (90 seconds continuous fire)
- Ineffective against supersonic missiles at close range
- Reloading time-consuming
- Expensive ammunition (DU/tungsten rounds)
- May engage friendly aircraft if not set properly
- Debris from destroyed missiles may still hit ship
- Cannot engage beyond 1500m
- Single mount has limited arc coverage
- Power failure = no defense

## Historical Notes

CIWS emerged from 1967 Israeli Navy experience with missile attacks. The 1987 USS Stark incident (hit by two Exocets) accelerated CIWS deployment. Phalanx entered service in 1980, providing automated close-in defense.

Combat validation came in 1991 when USS Jarrett's Phalanax engaged an incoming missile (though it also shot down a friendly A-6 aircraft, highlighting IFF challenges). During the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, CIWS systems were maintained at high readiness.

The 2016 USS Mason engagement saw CIWS used alongside other systems to defeat anti-ship cruise missiles fired by Houthi forces off Yemen. Modern ships mount 2-4 CIWS to provide overlapping coverage.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential last-ditch defense in missile age
- Mount multiple CIWS for 360-degree coverage
- Keep ammunition loaded and system active in threat areas
- Automatic mode responds faster than manual
- Does not replace SAMs - complements them
- Short range means missiles may hit even if destroyed
- Monitor ammunition status - reloading takes time
- Modern supersonic missiles challenge CIWS effectiveness
- Can engage small boats and helicopters effectively
- IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) critical to prevent friendly fire
- Consider firing arcs when placing on ship
- Particularly valuable for ships without long-range SAMs
- Multiple incoming missiles may saturate single CIWS
