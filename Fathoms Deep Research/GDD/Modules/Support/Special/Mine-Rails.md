# Mine Rails

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-004 |
| **Era** | 1900-Present |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 8,000 kg (rails + equipment) |
| **Power Draw** | 5 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 6 (mine handling crew) |

## Description

Stern-mounted rail system for rapid deployment of naval mines. Mines are stored in holds, moved to rails, armed, and rolled overboard in controlled patterns. Enables offensive and defensive minelaying to deny areas to enemy shipping, protect ports and harbors, or create barriers to enemy fleet movements.

## Effect on Gameplay

Allows you to deploy minefields to restrict enemy movement, protect areas, or set traps. Mines remain active for extended periods, creating persistent area denial. Effective defensive and offensive tool, but requires tactical planning and knowledge of enemy routes. Friendly ships must avoid your own minefields.

## Specifications

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Mine Capacity** | 40-200 mines (ship dependent) |
| **Deployment Rate** | 10-20 mines per minute |
| **Rail Type** | Stern rails with rollers |
| **Mine Types** | Contact, magnetic, acoustic, influence |
| **Arming System** | Timer or depth-activated |
| **Mine Storage** | Below-deck magazines |
| **Deployment Speed** | Up to 20 knots |
| **Pattern Control** | Automated spacing or manual |

## System Components

### Mine Rails
- **Track system**: Guides mines overboard
- **Rollers**: Reduce friction for easy deployment
- **Release mechanisms**: Controlled mine release
- **Spacing controls**: Set mine intervals
- **Safety locks**: Prevent accidental release
- **Stern mounting**: Aft location for safe deployment

### Storage and Handling
- **Mine magazines**: Below-deck storage
- **Hoists**: Move mines from magazine to rails
- **Trolleys**: Transport mines on deck
- **Arming stations**: Set fuses and activate mines
- **Safety zones**: Isolated storage areas
- **Ventilation**: Remove battery gas fumes

### Control Systems
- **Pattern selector**: Automated deployment patterns
- **Navigation interface**: Mine position logging
- **Release controller**: Manual or automatic drops
- **Arming panel**: Set mine activation parameters
- **Safety interlocks**: Prevent premature arming

## Mine Types

### Contact Mines
- **Horns**: Impact detonation
- **Moored**: Tethered below surface
- **Depth**: Set to catch surface ships or submarines
- **Effectiveness**: Mechanical reliability
- **Era**: 1900-present

### Magnetic Mines
- **Detection**: Ship's magnetic field triggers
- **Activation**: Degaussing can defeat
- **Moored or Ground**: Shallow or deep water
- **Effectiveness**: High against unprotected ships
- **Era**: 1939-present

### Acoustic Mines
- **Detection**: Ship noise triggers mine
- **Discrimination**: Can distinguish ship types
- **Signature**: Propeller noise primary target
- **Effectiveness**: Hard to sweep
- **Era**: 1943-present

### Influence Mines (Modern)
- **Multi-sensor**: Magnetic + acoustic + pressure
- **Smart logic**: Counts ships, selective targeting
- **Anti-sweep**: Resists countermeasures
- **Programmable**: Target specific ship types
- **Era**: 1960-present

## Minelaying Operations

### Planning
1. **Target area**: Identify choke points, routes
2. **Mine type**: Select appropriate mine
3. **Pattern**: Determine field layout
4. **Density**: Calculate mines needed
5. **Navigation**: Plot exact positions

### Deployment
1. **Load mines**: Move from magazine to rails
2. **Arm mines**: Set activation timers/depths
3. **Navigate**: Follow precise course
4. **Deploy**: Drop mines at calculated intervals
5. **Record**: Log exact positions (critical!)
6. **Escape**: Exit area before mines activate

### Pattern Types

#### Barrier Field
- Linear pattern across channel
- Multiple rows in depth
- Blocks passage
- High mine density

#### Protective Field
- Surrounds port or anchorage
- Gaps for friendly traffic
- Multiple defensive lines
- Very high density

#### Harassment Field
- Sparse pattern
- Forces minesweeping
- Slows enemy movement
- Psychological effect

#### Decoy Field
- Visible/detectable mines
- Diverts traffic to real field
- Small number of actual mines
- Economy of force

## Tactical Applications

### Offensive Mining
- **Enemy ports**: Blockade harbors
- **Shipping lanes**: Disrupt logistics
- **Invasion beaches**: Prevent amphibious assault
- **Strategic straits**: Control key passages

### Defensive Mining
- **Own ports**: Protect against attack
- **Fleet anchorages**: Secure base areas
- **Coastal approaches**: Deny amphibious landing
- **Retreat routes**: Cover withdrawal

### Tactical Mining
- **Pursuit barrier**: Slow pursuing enemy
- **Flank protection**: Secure battle area edges
- **Night operations**: Covert deployment
- **Combined arms**: Support surface action

## Advantages

- Passive area denial (no power needed after deployment)
- Force multiplier (small minelayer controls large area)
- Persistent (mines active for months)
- Psychological impact (enemy fears entering areas)
- Economy of force (few mines tie down many ships)
- Defensive and offensive applications
- Can be laid rapidly
- Effective against all ship types

## Limitations

- Danger to friendly forces (must track fields)
- International law restrictions (must be charted)
- Indiscriminate (affects all ships)
- Expensive to clear after war
- Limited ammunition (finite mine load)
- Vulnerable during laying (slow, predictable)
- Countermeasures exist (minesweeping, MCM)
- Weather affects accuracy
- Drifting mines dangerous to layer
- Political implications

## Friendly Force Considerations

**CRITICAL**: You must track your own minefields!
- Log exact positions
- Share data with friendly forces
- Leave gaps for friendly passage
- Use recognition systems (coded deactivation)
- Plan clearing operations post-conflict
- Maintain charts of safe routes

## Historical Notes

Naval mining has influenced every maritime conflict since WWI. The North Sea Mine Barrage (1918) used 70,000 mines to bottle up the German High Seas Fleet. WWII saw extensive mining - over 1 million mines laid, causing 6-7% of ship losses. The Germans used magnetic mines effectively until countermeasures were developed.

The Soviet Union emphasized mining heavily. Cold War plans involved massive mining operations to close NATO sea lanes. The U.S. Navy mining of Haiphong Harbor (1972) was strategically decisive in ending the Vietnam War - mines closed North Vietnam's primary port, choking supplies.

Modern conflicts show mining remains relevant. The 1991 Gulf War saw Iraqi mines damage USS Princeton and Tripoli despite high-tech navies. The 1990s saw mines threaten operations in the Adriatic. Small nations use mines as asymmetric weapons against superior navies.

Minelaying ships ranged from converted merchant vessels (WWI) to purpose-built fast minelayers (WWII's HMS Abdiel class) to submarines (modern). Even destroyers and cruisers carried mine rails for rapid deployment. The versatility of minelaying made it standard capability for many warships.

Post-WWII, many navies reduced minelaying emphasis, focusing on MCM instead. However, the strategic value of mining ensures it remains in arsenals. Modern mines are sophisticated, discriminating weapons far removed from simple contact mines.
