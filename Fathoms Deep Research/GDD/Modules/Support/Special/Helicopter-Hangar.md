# Helicopter Hangar

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPL-001 |
| **Era** | 1960+ |
| **Category** | Special |
| **Weight** | 45,000 kg |

## Description

Enclosed hangar facility for shipboard helicopter operations. The hangar provides maintenance space, spare parts storage, weapons stowage, and protection for embarked helicopters. Unlike WWII floatplanes that required catapults and cranes, helicopters can launch and recover independently using flight decks. Modern naval helicopters extend the ship's capabilities dramatically - anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface targeting, reconnaissance, search and rescue, and vertical replenishment.

The hangar includes aircraft maintenance facilities, armament storage (torpedoes, depth charges, missiles), fuel systems, and crew accommodations for aircrew. Modern destroyers and frigates typically operate 1-2 helicopters, while cruisers may carry 2-3. Landing deck helicopter (LAMPS) systems integrate aircraft sensors with ship combat systems.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed with compatible helicopters:
- **Extended ASW Range**: Detect submarines 50km+ from ship
- **Over-Horizon Targeting**: Identify surface targets for missile strikes
- **Reconnaissance**: Scout beyond radar horizon
- **SAR Operations**: Rescue downed pilots and survivors
- **Vertical Replenishment**: Transfer supplies between ships
- **Anti-Ship Missiles**: Some helicopters carry Exocet, Penguin, etc.

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Aircraft Capacity | 1-3 helicopters (ship dependent) |
| Hangar Dimensions | 15m x 12m x 5m (typical) |
| Flight Deck | Reinforced helicopter pad with tie-downs |
| ASW Range Extension | +50-80 km |
| Sortie Duration | 2-4 hours per mission |
| Turnaround Time | 30-60 minutes (refuel/rearm) |
| Weather Limits | Sea state 5+ prevents operations |
| Crew | 12 (maintenance, armorers, air crew) |

## Advantages

- Dramatically extends ASW capabilities
- Over-horizon targeting for anti-ship missiles
- Multi-role capability (ASW, ASuW, SAR, scout)
- Helicopters can operate independently of ship
- Critical force multiplier for modern warfare
- Enables network-centric operations
- Can carry ASW torpedoes, depth charges, sonobuoys
- Provides search radar extension
- Essential for modern destroyer/frigate/cruiser
- Can coordinate with multiple ships

## Disadvantages

- Very heavy (affects ship design significantly)
- Large target for anti-ship missiles
- Weather dependent (cannot operate in storms)
- Helicopters vulnerable to enemy fighters
- High maintenance requirements
- Expensive to operate
- Requires trained aircrew
- Limited by aircraft endurance
- Hangar vulnerable to fire
- Takes significant deck space

## Historical Notes

Helicopter operations at sea began in the 1950s for plane guard and SAR duties. The ASW helicopter emerged in the 1960s as submarines became increasingly dangerous. LAMPS (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System) integrated helicopters into US Navy destroyer operations, with SH-2 Seasprite and later SH-60 Seahawk becoming standard.

Soviet Kamov Ka-25 and Ka-27 helicopters operated from destroyers and cruisers, providing ASW capability. British ships in the Falklands (1982) extensively used Lynx and Sea King helicopters for ASW, reconnaissance, and anti-ship strikes (Sea Skua missiles).

Modern destroyers are designed around helicopter operations. The Arleigh Burke class operates 2 SH-60 helicopters, while European frigates typically carry 1-2 medium helicopters. Chinese Type 052D destroyers similarly integrate helicopter operations as core capability.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential for ASW operations in modern era
- Coordinate helicopter search patterns with sonar coverage
- Helicopters extend your detection range dramatically
- Use for over-horizon targeting of surface threats
- Weather limits operations - plan accordingly
- Vulnerable to enemy fighters - provide CAP if possible
- Helicopter torpedo attacks very effective vs. submarines
- Dipping sonar detects submarines passively
- Can drop sonobuoys for wide-area search
- SAR capability saves downed pilots
- Vertical replenishment keeps task force supplied
- Multiple helicopters enable continuous operations (rotation)
