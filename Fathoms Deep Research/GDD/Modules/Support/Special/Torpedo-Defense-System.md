# Torpedo Defense System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPL-004 |
| **Era** | 1980+ |
| **Category** | Special |
| **Weight** | 2,800 kg |

## Description

Integrated system for detecting and defeating incoming torpedoes. Modern torpedo defense combines passive acoustic detection, active countermeasures, and in some cases hard-kill interceptors. The system detects torpedo launch or approach via towed array or hull-mounted hydrophones, classifies the threat, and deploys appropriate countermeasures - acoustic decoys, noise makers, bubble curtains, or anti-torpedo torpedoes.

Systems like the US Navy's Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) or Russian Paket-E integrate sensors, decoys, and hard-kill weapons. The challenge is severe: modern torpedoes are fast, smart, and designed to defeat countermeasures. Reaction time is measured in seconds once a torpedo is detected close aboard.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed and active:
- **Torpedo Detection**: Passive acoustic warning of incoming torpedoes
- **Automatic Decoy Deployment**: Launches acoustic decoys automatically
- **Hard-Kill Option**: Anti-torpedo torpedoes intercept incoming weapons
- **Evasion Guidance**: System recommends optimal evasive maneuvers
- **Survival Probability**: +50-70% chance to defeat torpedo attack

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Detection Range | 1000-3000m (acoustic) |
| Countermeasure Types | Acoustic decoys, noisemakers, interceptors |
| Decoy Capacity | 8-16 decoys |
| Interceptor Capacity | 4-8 anti-torpedo torpedoes |
| Reaction Time | 3-8 seconds |
| Effectiveness | 50-70% defeat probability |
| Coverage | 360 degrees |
| Reloading | Manual, requires 5-10 minutes |

## Advantages

- Critical defense against submarine torpedo attacks
- Automated detection and response
- Multiple countermeasure types
- Can defeat wake-homing and acoustic-homing torpedoes
- Provides warning time for evasive maneuvers
- Hard-kill interceptors destroy incoming torpedoes
- Essential for surface ship survival vs. submarines
- Relatively lightweight system
- Can be retrofitted to older ships
- Provides layered defense

## Disadvantages

- Limited countermeasure capacity (expendable)
- Detection range limited vs. long-range torpedoes
- Modern torpedoes designed to defeat decoys
- No defense against very close launches
- Expensive expendables
- Cannot defend against torpedo salvo (multiple simultaneous)
- Effectiveness varies by torpedo sophistication
- Requires frequent reloading
- Hard-kill systems very expensive
- False alarms from marine life, cavitation

## Historical Notes

Torpedo defense evolved slowly compared to anti-missile systems. Cold War submarines posed such severe threats that surface ships had limited recourse beyond aggressive ASW. The Soviet "Long Lance" Type 65 torpedo and later wake-homing torpedoes prompted serious defensive development.

Nixie towed decoys provided basic acoustic countermeasures by the 1970s. The 2000s saw integrated systems emerge - the US Navy's SSTD program combined towed arrays, decoys, and potential hard-kill interceptors. Russian Paket-E provides small anti-torpedo torpedoes that intercept incoming weapons.

Modern submarines employ sophisticated torpedoes (Mk 48 ADCAP, Spearfish, Type 65) designed to defeat countermeasures through wire-guidance, wake-homing, and pattern-running algorithms. The offense-defense balance strongly favors submarines, making torpedo defense challenging.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential for operations in submarine threat areas
- Activate system when ASW conditions indicate submarine presence
- Decoys work best deployed early (before torpedo close aboard)
- Combine with aggressive maneuvering
- Speed and turns can break torpedo lock
- Hard-kill interceptors are last resort (close range)
- Multiple simultaneous torpedoes very difficult to defeat
- Best defense is killing submarine before it shoots
- Helicopter ASW dramatically improves survival (kills subs at range)
- Shallow water limits torpedo effectiveness (and countermeasures)
- Modern wake-homing torpedoes very hard to defeat
- Keep system reloaded and ready in submarine waters
- False alarms common - but can't ignore warnings
