# Hedgehog Launcher

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-006 |
| **Era** | 1942-1970 |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 6,000 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 5 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 4 (operators + loaders) |

## Description

Ahead-throwing anti-submarine weapon that fires a pattern of 24 small bombs ahead of the attacking ship. Unlike depth charges that require passing over the submarine, Hedgehog allows the attacking ship to maintain continuous sonar contact while weapons are in flight. Bombs explode only on contact, providing positive confirmation of hits without disrupting sonar with depth charge explosions.

## Effect on Gameplay

Dramatically improves ASW effectiveness compared to depth charges by maintaining sonar contact throughout the attack. The ahead-throwing capability allows you to track the submarine continuously and adjust course for follow-up attacks. Contact-fused bombs mean no wasted attacks - if you see an explosion, you hit the submarine.

## Specifications

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Projectiles** | 24 bombs per salvo |
| **Range** | 200-250m ahead |
| **Pattern** | Elliptical (40m x 130m) |
| **Explosive per Bomb** | 15 kg Torpex |
| **Fusing** | Contact only (no depth setting) |
| **Reload Time** | 2-3 minutes |
| **Launcher Type** | Fixed spigot mortar array |
| **Fire Control** | Simple gyro stabilization |

## System Components

### Launcher Frame
- **Spigot mortars**: 24 fixed launch tubes
- **Array pattern**: 4 rows of 6 launchers
- **Elevation**: Fixed 45-degree angle
- **Stabilization**: Gyro-stabilized mount
- **Deck mounting**: Forward deck location
- **Weather shield**: Protects launchers

### Projectiles
- **Hedgehog bomb**: Streamlined 30 kg bomb
- **Explosive**: 15 kg Torpex
- **Fuse**: Contact detonation only
- **Aerodynamics**: Stabilizing fins
- **Storage**: Ready magazine nearby
- **Handling**: Manual loading by crew

### Fire Control
- **Aiming**: Ship's heading sets direction
- **Timing**: Fire when submarine in predicted position
- **Stabilization**: Gyro compensates for ship motion
- **Range**: Fixed by projectile ballistics
- **Pattern**: Automatic spread on launch

## Attack Pattern

The 24 projectiles land in an elliptical pattern:
- **Length**: 130m (along track)
- **Width**: 40m (cross track)
- **Spacing**: ~15m between projectiles
- **Sinking**: All projectiles sink together
- **Coverage**: Submarine has 24 chances to be hit

## Attack Procedure

### Approach Phase
1. **Sonar contact**: Establish submarine track
2. **Calculate solution**: Determine course, speed, depth
3. **Attack course**: Steer to predicted position
4. **Range**: Close to 250m from contact
5. **Prepare**: Load Hedgehog if not already loaded

### Firing Phase
1. **Final bearing**: Confirm submarine position
2. **Fire**: Launch full pattern at correct moment
3. **Maintain course**: Continue tracking while bombs fly
4. **Impact**: 5 seconds flight time
5. **Observe**: Watch for contact explosions

### Post-Attack
- **Hit**: Contact explosion confirms kill/damage
- **Miss**: No explosions, sonar still tracking
- **Immediate follow-up**: Can reattack within 3 minutes
- **No sonar disruption**: Unlike depth charges

## Tactical Advantages

### Continuous Sonar Contact
- **No sonar loss**: Ship doesn't pass over submarine
- **Track throughout**: Know if submarine maneuvers
- **Immediate assessment**: Hit or miss known instantly
- **Quick reattack**: No regaining contact needed

### Contact Fusing
- **No false positives**: Explosion = hit
- **No sonar disruption**: No explosions without hit
- **Depth independence**: Works at any depth (within limits)
- **Positive confirmation**: Crew morale boost

### Higher Hit Probability
- **Statistics**: 25% hit rate (vs. 5% for depth charges)
- **Smaller pattern**: Tighter spread
- **Better aim**: Sonar maintains track
- **Multiple chances**: 24 projectiles per salvo

### Tactical Flexibility
- **Quick reload**: 2-3 minutes vs. 5+ for depth charges
- **Ammunition**: 6-8 salvos typical (144-192 bombs)
- **Standoff**: Don't risk torpedo by overrunning submarine
- **Speed**: Maintain higher speed than depth charge run

## Limitations

- Fixed range (200-250m) - cannot engage closer or farther
- Shallow depth limit (~60m) - deep submarines safe
- Small explosive charge (15 kg) - less damage than depth charge
- Contact required - near miss doesn't damage submarine
- Weather sensitive - rough seas degrade accuracy
- Limited ammunition - 6-8 salvos then exhausted
- No depth setting - submarine deep underwater may evade
- Fixed pattern - submarine can sometimes thread through
- Requires good fire control solution

## vs. Depth Charges

### Hedgehog Advantages
- Maintains sonar contact
- Higher hit probability (25% vs. 5%)
- Faster reattack
- Positive hit confirmation
- Standoff attack (safer from torpedo)

### Depth Charge Advantages
- Much larger explosive (200kg vs. 15kg)
- Near miss can damage submarine
- Effective against deep submarines
- Simpler equipment
- Pattern adjustable

## vs. Homing Torpedoes (Later Era)

Homing torpedoes (1960s+) eventually replaced Hedgehog:
- Longer range (kilometers vs. 250m)
- Self-guiding (no fire control needed)
- Effective against fast, deep submarines
- Larger warhead

Hedgehog remained useful:
- Much cheaper than torpedoes
- Faster reload
- Effective in shallow water
- Good for close encounters

## Historical Notes

Hedgehog was developed by the Royal Navy in 1941-42 as ASW effectiveness studies showed depth charges rarely hit submarines. The ahead-throwing weapon that maintained sonar contact was revolutionary. HMS Westcott made the first kill with Hedgehog in December 1942.

Statistics proved Hedgehog's value: depth charge attacks achieved kills in 5% of attacks; Hedgehog achieved 25% kill rate. The weapon became standard on Allied escorts. By 1944, Hedgehog equipped hundreds of ships. The weapon was decisive in the Battle of the Atlantic - U-boats could no longer rely on diving to escape attacks.

Famous Hedgehog actions include HMS Loch Killin sinking U-boats in 1945, and numerous destroyer escort kills. The weapon's psychological impact was significant - U-boat crews knew that ahead-throwing weapons meant they could be attacked without warning (unlike depth charges, which they heard coming).

Post-war, Hedgehog remained standard into the 1960s. The U.S. Navy kept it on many ships even after developing more advanced weapons. Some navies used Hedgehog into the 1970s-80s. The British developed the "Squid" - a larger, three-projectile ahead-thrower with depth charges, but Hedgehog remained more common.

The fundamental innovation - ahead-throwing weapons that maintain sonar contact - influenced all subsequent ASW weapons. ASROC, Malafon, Ikara, and modern vertical-launch ASROC all embody the principle Hedgehog pioneered: deliver weapon without losing sonar contact.
