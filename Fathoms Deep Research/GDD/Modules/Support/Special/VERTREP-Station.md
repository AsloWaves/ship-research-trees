# VERTREP Station

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-003 |
| **Era** | 1960-Present |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 5,000 kg (equipment) |
| **Power Draw** | 10 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 8 (handling crew) |

## Description

Vertical Replenishment station enabling helicopter cargo transfer without alongside refueling. Features marked landing spot, cargo handling equipment, safety systems, and communication gear for coordinated helicopter resupply operations. Allows rapid replenishment in high seas or tactical situations where alongside replenishment is impractical.

## Effect on Gameplay

Enables at-sea replenishment via helicopter without need for alongside approach. Significantly faster setup than UNREP, can operate in rougher seas, and maintains tactical speed and maneuvering. Critical for sustained operations when conventional replenishment is impossible or too risky.

## Specifications

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Transfer Rate** | 10 tons/hour |
| **Landing Spot** | Marked helicopter pad |
| **Max Lift** | 5 tons per load (helicopter dependent) |
| **Sea State Limit** | Sea State 5 (vs. 3 for UNREP) |
| **Range from Supply Ship** | 50-100 km |
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes |
| **Cargo Types** | Palletized stores, ammunition, fuel pods |

## VERTREP Operations

### Pre-Operation Planning
1. **Coordinate with supply ship**: Schedule, cargo list
2. **Weather check**: Wind, seas acceptable
3. **Clear deck**: Remove obstructions
4. **Brief crew**: Safety procedures
5. **Position ship**: Into wind, steady course

### Operation Sequence
1. **Supply helicopter launches**: Loaded with cargo
2. **Approach**: Helicopter radios intentions
3. **Hover**: Position over landing spot
4. **Lower cargo**: Sling or set down
5. **Disconnect**: Deck crew releases cargo
6. **Helicopter departs**: Returns for next load
7. **Move cargo**: Deck crew clears spot
8. **Repeat**: Until replenishment complete

### Cargo Types

#### Dry Cargo
- **Food**: Palletized provisions
- **Parts**: Spare components, tools
- **Stores**: Consumables, supplies
- **Mail**: Personnel mail and documents
- **Medical**: Pharmaceuticals, supplies

#### Ammunition
- **Small arms**: Boxed ammunition
- **Missiles**: Crated missiles (within weight limit)
- **Torpedoes**: Packaged torpedoes
- **Pyrotechnics**: Flares, signals

#### Fuel (Limited)
- **Fuel pods**: External bladders (500-1000 liters)
- **Drum fuel**: Barrels of aviation fuel
- **Emergency only**: Not primary fuel method

#### Personnel
- **Replacements**: New crew members
- **Medical evacuation**: Injured to hospital
- **Detachment rotations**: Aviation crew changes

## Advantages Over Alongside Replenishment

### Tactical Flexibility
- Maintain speed (vs. slow UNREP speed)
- Maintain maneuvering (vs. straight course required)
- Maintain tactical formation
- Rapid breakaway if threat appears

### Weather Capability
- Operates in higher seas (Sea State 5 vs. 3)
- No collision risk from rough seas
- Can replenish when UNREP impossible
- All-weather capability (with qualified crew)

### Speed
- Setup: 5 minutes (vs. 30+ minutes for UNREP)
- Transfer: Rapid for small amounts
- Breakaway: Immediate (vs. unrep rig recovery)
- Multiple ships: Helicopter rotates between ships

### Range Flexibility
- Supply ship can stand off 50+ km
- Supply ship not in weapon range
- Can receive from land bases
- Multiple supply sources possible

## Disadvantages vs. UNREP

### Transfer Rate
- 10 tons/hour (vs. 100+ tons/hour for UNREP)
- Not suitable for bulk fuel transfer
- Multiple helicopter sorties needed for large amounts
- Limited by helicopter availability

### Capacity
- 5 ton max loads (helicopter dependent)
- Cannot transfer heavy items
- Bulk liquids difficult
- Ammunition transfer slower than UNREP

### Dependence
- Requires helicopter availability
- Weather can ground helicopters
- Helicopter breakdown stops operations
- Limited by helicopter endurance

## Tactical Applications

### Combat Operations
- Replenish without breaking formation
- Emergency ammunition resupply during action
- Maintain readiness posture
- Quick response to supply needs

### Special Operations
- Covert replenishment (small profile)
- Irregular schedule (vs. predictable UNREP)
- Isolated ship resupply
- Emergency medical evacuation combined

### Training
- Less crew-intensive than UNREP
- Faster qualification
- Lower risk operations
- Good for building proficiency

## Limitations

- Not suitable for bulk transfers (fuel, food)
- Helicopter availability critical
- Weather still limits operations
- Slower than UNREP for large amounts
- Requires helicopter-compatible cargo packaging
- Limited by deck space
- Cannot replace full UNREP for major replenishment
- Deck operations dangerous (downwash, rotor blades)

## Historical Notes

Vertical replenishment emerged in the 1960s as helicopters became powerful and reliable enough for sustained cargo operations. The U.S. Navy pioneered VERTREP with CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, enabling underway replenishment in conditions unsuitable for alongside operations.

Vietnam War operations demonstrated VERTREP value. Ships on Yankee Station conducted frequent helicopter replenishment, maintaining station without lengthy transits for conventional replenishment. The Falklands War saw extensive VERTREP use - British ships received supplies from merchant vessels via helicopter, avoiding the risks of close approach.

Modern operations employ VERTREP routinely. Supply ships like USNS Lewis and Clark carry CH-53 or MH-60 helicopters specifically for VERTREP operations. The method has become standard, complementing rather than replacing conventional UNREP. Carriers often receive mail and priority cargo via VERTREP while fuel and bulk stores come via UNREP.

The flexibility of VERTREP proved valuable during counter-piracy operations off Somalia. Ships maintained wide spacing while helicopters shuttled supplies, reducing vulnerability to small boat attacks. Similarly, in contested waters, VERTREP enables replenishment while maintaining tactical formation and readiness.

Future developments may include autonomous cargo drones providing VERTREP capability without manned helicopter risk, though manned helicopters will likely remain the primary method for the foreseeable future.
