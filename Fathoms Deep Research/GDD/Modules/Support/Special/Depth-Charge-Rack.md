# Depth Charge Rack

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPE-005 |
| **Era** | 1915-1970 |
| **Category** | Special Systems |
| **Weight** | 4,000 kg (racks + equipment) |
| **Crew Required** | 4 (DC handlers) |

## Description

Stern and side-mounted racks for storing and deploying depth charges against submerged submarines. Depth charges roll off stern racks or are thrown from side throwers in patterns designed to bracket the submarine. The classic ASW weapon from WWI through the early Cold War before homing torpedoes became primary ASW armament.

## Effect on Gameplay

Provides basic anti-submarine capability by dropping depth charges in the submarine's estimated position. Requires good sonar contact and prediction of submarine movement. Multiple charges in patterns increase hit probability. Most effective when submarine's position is well-known and ship can make multiple attack runs.

## Specifications

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Total Capacity** | 20-40 depth charges |
| **Stern Racks** | 6-12 charges |
| **Side Throwers** | 4-8 per side |
| **Reload Time** | 2-5 minutes |
| **Drop Rate** | 1 charge per 2 seconds (stern) |
| **Pattern Types** | 5-charge, 7-charge, 10-charge |
| **Effective Depth** | 50-300m (setting dependent) |
| **Kill Radius** | 6m (lethal), 12m (damage) |

## System Components

### Stern Racks

- **Handling**: Hoists and dollies
- **Arming**: Set depth before loading
- **Types**: Mix of shallow, medium, deep settings
- **Safety**: Isolated from ship's systems

## Depth Charge Types

### Standard Charge (Mk 6, Mk 7)
- **Weight**: 150-200 kg
- **Explosive**: 100-150 kg TNT/Torpex
- **Depth Range**: 15-300m
- **Sink Rate**: 2-4 m/s
- **Kill Radius**: 6m
- **Era**: WWII standard

### Heavy Charge (Mk 9, Mk 10)
- **Weight**: 300 kg
- **Explosive**: 200 kg Torpex
- **Depth Range**: 50-600m
- **Sink Rate**: 4 m/s
- **Kill Radius**: 8m
- **Era**: Late WWII, Cold War

### Shallow Charge (Mk 37)
- **Weight**: 100 kg
- **Explosive**: 50 kg
- **Depth Range**: 5-100m
- **Sink Rate**: Fast
- **Purpose**: Schnorkel-depth submarines
- **Era**: 1950s+

## Attack Patterns

### 5-Charge Pattern
- 1 stern charge, 2 per side thrower
- Basic pattern
- 30m x 30m coverage
- Light submarine likely survives

### 7-Charge Pattern
- 3 stern, 2 per side
- Standard WWII pattern
- 40m x 50m coverage
- Better probability of damage

### 10-Charge Pattern
- 4 stern, 3 per side
- Heavy saturation
- 50m x 60m coverage
- High probability kill if centered

### Diamond Pattern
- Sequential drops forming diamond
- Multiple depth settings
- Covers depth uncertainty
- Good against deep submarines

## Attack Procedure

### Approach
1. **Sonar contact**: Maintain tracking
2. **Calculate position**: Estimate depth, course, speed
3. **Attack course**: Head for predicted position
4. **Set charges**: Depth setting per pattern
5. **Arm crew**: Ready charges on racks

### Delivery
1. **Final bearing**: Confirm submarine position
2. **Release**: Drop pattern as ship passes over
3. **Maneuver**: Turn away to avoid own explosions
4. **Observe**: Look for results (oil, debris, etc.)
5. **Reacquire**: Regain sonar contact

### Follow-Up
- **No kill**: Reset, re-attack
- **Damage**: Follow oil trail, finish off
- **Kill**: Confirm wreckage/survivors
- **Lost contact**: Begin search pattern

## Tactical Employment

### Single Ship ASW
- Requires good sonar
- Multiple attacks likely needed
- Submarine can evade between runs
- Exhausts depth charge ammunition quickly

### Coordinated Attack
- Multiple ships bracket submarine
- Continuous depth charging
- Submarine cannot surface or escape
- High probability of kill

### Barrier Patrol
- Drop charges along patrol line
- Forces submarine to remain deep/slow
- Discourages transit through area
- Harassing effect

### Convoy Escort
- Quick response to contacts
- Drive submarine deep
- Prevent attack on merchants
- May not achieve kill but protects convoy

## Advantages

- Simple, reliable weapon
- No guidance needed
- Saturates large volume
- Effective against stationary/slow submarines
- Quick reaction weapon
- Inexpensive
- Proven combat record
- Crew training straightforward

## Limitations

- Requires passing over submarine (vulnerable to torpedo)
- Submarine can evade between attacks
- Limited ammunition (20-40 charges)
- Ship must slow to detect after attack (sonar disrupted)
- Submarine knows attack coming (hears approach)
- Deep submarines hard to hit (long sink time)
- Fast submarines evade easily
- Modern submarines too deep/fast
- Own explosions damage ship's sonar
- Reload time between attacks

## Obsolescence

By 1960s-70s, depth charges became secondary to:
- **Ahead-throwing weapons**: Hedgehog, Squid (no sonar loss)
- **Homing torpedoes**: Self-guiding, longer range
- **ASW helicopters**: Standoff delivery
- **Rocket depth charges**: ASROC, Malafon, etc.

Depth charges retained for:
- Close-range emergency
- Shallow-water ASW
- Supplementary weapon
- Low-tech navies

## Historical Notes

Depth charges revolutionized ASW in WWI. Early charges were crude barrels of explosive, but even these forced U-boats deep and disrupted attacks. By 1918, improved patterns and tactics made U-boats vulnerable.

WWII saw depth charges as primary ASW weapon. The Battle of the Atlantic was won partly through improved depth charge tactics - creeping attacks, coordinated groups, and better sonar. Allied escorts sank hundreds of U-boats with depth charges, though each kill averaged 200+ charges expended.

Famous depth charge actions include HMS Walker sinking U-99 (1941), USS England's six-submarine rampage (1944), and countless convoy actions. The weapon was straightforward but required skill, persistence, and courage to overrun a submarine and drop charges knowing the submarine might torpedo you first.

Cold War ASW emphasized standoff weapons. Nuclear submarines were too fast and deep for conventional depth charging. The advent of homing torpedoes and ASW rockets reduced depth charge importance. However, they remained in inventory for close encounters.

Modern navies rarely mount depth charge racks, though some frigates retain capability. The weapon persists in low-tech navies and as backup armament. The fundamental principle - deliver explosive charge to submarine's location - remains valid even if delivery methods have evolved.
