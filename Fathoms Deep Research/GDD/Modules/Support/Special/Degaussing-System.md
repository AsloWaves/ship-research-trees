# Degaussing System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | SPL-002 |
| **Era** | 1940+ |
| **Category** | Special |
| **Weight** | 3,500 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 80 kW |

## Description

Electromagnetic coil system that counteracts the ship's magnetic signature. Steel ships create magnetic anomalies detectable by magnetic mines and magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD). Degaussing generates opposing magnetic fields that neutralize the ship's signature, making magnetic mines less likely to detonate and reducing MAD detection range. The system consists of cables wound throughout the ship's structure, powered by DC generators.

During WWII, degaussing was applied through "degaussing ranges" where ships passed over measurement coils that determined the ship's magnetic signature. Degaussing currents were then adjusted to minimize the signature. Modern ships feature built-in degaussing integrated into construction, though periodic ranging remains necessary as the ship's magnetism changes over time.

## Effect on Gameplay

When activated:
- **Magnetic Mine Resistance**: -70% chance of magnetic mine detonation
- **MAD Detection Reduction**: -50% detection range by MAD sensors
- **Submarine Detection**: Harder for submarines to detect magnetically
- **Continuous Operation**: System runs constantly in mine threat areas
- **Power Trade-off**: Significant power draw when active

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Magnetic Signature Reduction | 70-80% |
| Mine Detonation Probability | -70% vs. magnetic mines |
| MAD Detection Range | -50% enemy MAD effectiveness |
| Power Consumption | 80 kW (when active) |
| Cable Length | 1-3 km (throughout ship) |
| Adjustment Required | Periodic ranging every 6 months |
| Crew | 1 operator to monitor/adjust |
| Reliability | 93% |

## Advantages

- Critical protection vs. magnetic mines
- Reduces MAD detection (ASW aircraft threat)
- Passive defense (no countermeasure launch required)
- Works continuously when powered
- No ammunition to expend
- Protects against major threat in littoral waters
- Essential for operations near enemy coasts
- Relatively lightweight for protection provided
- Proven technology
- Can be combined with mechanical minesweeping

## Disadvantages

- High power consumption (80 kW continuous)
- Requires periodic re-ranging (maintenance)
- Ineffective against acoustic, contact, or pressure mines
- Does not eliminate magnetic signature entirely
- Power failure = no protection
- Cable routing vulnerable to battle damage
- Adjustment requires specialized facilities
- Less effective if system damaged
- Modern mines may compensate for degaussing

## Historical Notes

Magnetic mines devastated Allied shipping in 1939-40 until British scientists reverse-engineered captured German mines. Degaussing was rapidly developed and deployed fleet-wide. By 1941, most Allied warships and merchantmen featured degaussing systems, dramatically reducing mine losses.

German magnetic mines in British ports sank numerous ships before countermeasures emerged. Operation "Outward" saw degaussing ranges established at major ports. USS North Carolina and other US battleships featured integrated degaussing from construction.

Modern mines feature sophisticated magnetic sensors that can discriminate degaussed signatures, but degaussing remains valuable. During Desert Storm (1991), coalition ships operated with degaussing active in the mine-threatened Persian Gulf.

## Tactical Tips

- Activate when entering mine threat areas
- Power consumption significant - manage electrical load
- Does not protect against all mine types (acoustic/pressure remain threats)
- Particularly important in shallow water operations
- Combine with mine avoidance tactics
- Modern smart mines may defeat degaussing
- Useful for ASW - reduces MAD detection by enemy aircraft
- Schedule ranging maintenance regularly
- Battle damage to cables can compromise system
- Essential for amphibious operations and coastal bombardment
- Does not prevent all magnetic mine detonations - reduces probability
- Consider EMCON implications - degaussing field detectable by sophisticated sensors
