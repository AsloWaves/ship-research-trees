## Without DC Center

Ships without this module:
- Basic damage display only
- Slower repairs
- Less efficient firefighting
- May not know extent of flooding
- Crew works uncoordinated

## Capabilities

### Status Monitoring
- Hull integrity by section
- Machinery status
- Electrical systems
- Weapon systems operational status

### Coordination
- Direct repair parties
- Prioritize damage
- Manage counterflooding
- Coordinate magazine flooding (emergency)

### Automation (Modern)
- Automatic fire suppression activation
- Remote valve control
- Automated damage reports

## Historical Notes

The DC Center concept developed from hard lessons in WWII. Ships that survived severe damage (like USS Franklin, USS Yorktown) did so through exceptional damage control. Centralizing information and coordination proved essential. Modern ships have automated systems, but trained DC crews remain critical.

## Famous Examples

- USS Yorktown: Survived Coral Sea damage, fought at Midway
- HMS Illustrious: Survived 6 bomb hits at Malta
- IJN damage control generally inferior (less emphasis)

## Compatible With

- CIC Bridge (integrated displays)
- Modern Bridge (full automation)
- All ship types benefit
