# Fire Suppression System

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | DCM-002 |
| **Era** | 1920+ |
| **Category** | Damage Control |
| **Weight** | 5,000 kg |

## Description

Automated fire suppression system using fixed piping, sprinklers, and specialized extinguishing agents. The system provides rapid response to fires through pre-positioned nozzles in machinery spaces, magazines, and fuel storage areas. Early systems used steam or CO2, while modern installations employ Halon, FM-200, or water mist technology. Automatic activation upon fire detection enables suppression before fires grow beyond control.

The system integrates heat/smoke detectors, control valves, and distribution piping throughout protected spaces. CO2 flooding systems can suppress machinery space fires in seconds but pose crew safety risks. Modern clean-agent systems are safer for personnel while remaining effective against electrical and fuel fires.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Automated Firefighting**: +50% faster fire suppression
- **Rapid Response**: Activates automatically upon detection
- **Protected Spaces**: Machinery, magazines, fuel storage
- **Reduced Crew Requirement**: Automation reduces manpower needs
- **Damage Prevention**: Catches fires before they spread

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Firefighting Speed | 30-40 seconds per fire (50% faster) |
| Coverage | Machinery, magazines, critical spaces |
| Agent Types | CO2, Halon, FM-200, water mist |
| Activation | Automatic or manual |
| Response Time | <5 seconds from detection |
| Crew Required | 2 (system operators/monitors) |
| Reliability | 90% |
| Power | 15 kW (pumps, valves, controls) |

## Advantages

- Much faster than manual firefighting
- Automatic activation (no crew delay)
- Protects critical spaces 24/7
- Reduces crew casualties from firefighting
- Can suppress fires in spaces too dangerous for crew
- Particularly effective against fuel and electrical fires
- Modern agents safe for equipment
- Integrated with fire detection systems
- Reduces total crew requirement
- Critical for machinery space protection

## Disadvantages

- Requires power for pumps and controls
- Fixed coverage (only protected spaces)
- CO2 systems dangerous to crew in space
- Agent supply limited (can be exhausted)
- Expensive installation and maintenance
- Piping vulnerable to battle damage
- False activations possible
- Requires periodic testing and inspection
- Some agents (Halon) environmentally harmful
- May not protect all ship spaces

## Historical Notes

Fire suppression systems evolved from primitive CO2 flooding to sophisticated automated networks. Early systems appeared on 1920s warships, particularly protecting magazines and oil-fired boiler rooms. CO2 flooding could suppress machinery fires rapidly but killed crew who didn't evacuate in time.

USS Franklin (1945) might have been saved by better fire suppression - massive fires from bomb hits overwhelmed manual DC. The lessons drove post-war adoption of comprehensive suppression systems. Modern US Navy ships feature extensive automated suppression throughout engineering spaces.

The 1967 USS Forrestal fire demonstrated the need for comprehensive suppression - initial small fires grew into catastrophe, killing 134 sailors. Subsequent ships featured enhanced automated systems. HMS Sheffield (1982) lacked sufficient suppression for aluminum fires, contributing to her loss.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential upgrade from manual DC baseline
- Particularly important for machinery spaces
- Ensure crew evacuates before CO2 activation
- Monitor system status - battle damage may disable
- Combine with manual DC for comprehensive coverage
- Test systems regularly in peacetime
- Budget for agent refills after use
- Modern systems safer for crew than CO2
- Critical for ships with reduced crew (automation compensates)
- Don't rely solely on automation - maintain manual capability
- Especially valuable for large ships with extensive compartmentation
