# Centralized Damage Control Center

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | DC-002 |
| **Era** | 1940-Present |
| **Category** | Damage Control |
| **Weight** | 8,000 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 15 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 6 |

## Description

Protected command center deep within the ship for coordinating all damage control activities. Features communication systems to all compartments, damage control diagrams, status boards, and direct command of DC parties throughout the ship. Transforms damage control from decentralized efforts into coordinated ship-wide response.

## Effect on Gameplay

Unlocks detailed damage display showing exactly what systems are damaged and where. Provides significant bonuses to all repair activities through better coordination and prioritization. The DC Center gives you complete situational awareness of your ship's condition and enables tactical decisions about repair priorities.

## Specifications

| Capability | Bonus |
|------------|-------|
| **Repair Speed** | +25% |
| **Fire Fighting** | +20% faster |
| **Flooding Control** | +15% faster |
| **Crew Efficiency** | +15% DC effectiveness |
| **Damage Assessment** | Complete real-time status |
| **Coordination** | Ship-wide DC command |
| **Priority Management** | Intelligent repair sequencing |

## Facilities

### Communication Systems
- Sound-powered phones to all compartments
- Damage reporting circuits
- All-hands announcing system
- Radio link to bridge
- Emergency backup communications

### Status Monitoring
- Ship diagrams with damage marking
- Compartment status boards
- Machinery condition displays
- Electrical system status
- Watertight integrity monitoring

### Control Equipment
- Remote valve controls (modern systems)
- Flooding control panels
- Fire detection system monitors
- Ventilation control
- Emergency lighting controls

## UI Enhancements

When DC Center is installed:

### Damage Display
- **Detailed section view**: See exact damaged components
- **System status**: What still works vs. offline
- **Repair progress**: Real-time repair status bars
- **Priority indicators**: Critical vs. minor damage
- **Crew locations**: Where DC parties are working

### Flooding Status
- **Water level by compartment**: Percentage flooded
- **Rate of flooding**: Getting worse or controlled
- **Stability impact**: Effect on list/trim
- **Counterflooding options**: Balance ship
- **Emergency measures**: Magazine flooding, etc.

### Fire Status
- **Fire locations**: Marked on ship diagram
- **Intensity levels**: Small to major conflagration
- **Spread risk**: Adjacent compartments at risk
- **Ventilation status**: Isolate or supply areas
- **Fire party locations**: Which teams responding

## Coordination Benefits

### Intelligent Prioritization
The DC Center automatically recommends:
- Repair propulsion before weapons (if fleeing)
- Repair weapons before propulsion (if engaged)
- Fight fires near magazines first
- Seal flooding in machinery spaces priority
- Balance repair parties across multiple damages

### Resource Management
- Track DC party status and location
- Monitor equipment and supplies
- Coordinate specialist teams
- Manage breathing apparatus supply
- Allocate personnel optimally

### Communication Hub
- Reports flow to single location
- Orders disseminated rapidly
- Bridge receives filtered information
- Emergency situations escalated immediately
- Maintains contact during battle confusion

## Without DC Center

Ships lacking this module:
- Basic damage display only (hull%, systems down/up)
- Slower, uncoordinated repairs
- Poor damage assessment
- Cannot effectively prioritize
- Limited flooding/fire information
- Crew works independently rather than as coordinated effort

## Tactical Implications

### Combat Endurance
Ships with DC Centers can:
- Continue fighting despite heavy damage
- Prioritize repairs based on tactical situation
- Make informed decisions about withdrawal
- Maintain combat effectiveness longer

### Survival Decisions
DC Center enables:
- Accurate assessment of abandon ship necessity
- Informed counterflooding to prevent capsizing
- Critical damage control (magazine flooding, etc.)
- Effective coordination during catastrophic damage

## Limitations

- Requires protected location (not always possible)
- Vulnerable to power loss (emergency backup needed)
- Cannot repair damage, only coordinate repairs
- Still limited by available DC parties
- Communication can be disrupted
- Does not prevent damage, only improves response
- Requires trained operators

## Historical Notes

The DC Center concept emerged from WWII battle damage analysis. USS Yorktown survived Coral Sea damage partly due to good DC coordination. After Midway, the Navy formalized DC Centers on all major ships. The British adopted similar "Damage Control Headquarters" after learning hard lessons in the Mediterranean.

USS Franklin survived catastrophic damage in 1945 (724 killed, massive fires, bomb hits) largely due to her DC organization. The DC Center coordinated hundreds of men fighting fires and floods across the ship. Without centralized coordination, the carrier would have been abandoned.

Conversely, IJN generally lacked centralized DC, contributing to losses. Japanese carriers at Midway had poor DC coordination - fires spread uncontrollably while crews worked without central direction. The British carrier HMS Ark Royal might have been saved with better DC coordination when torpedoed in 1941.

Modern DC Centers include computerized monitoring, remote valve control, and integration with combat systems. The DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class has a sophisticated DC Central equipped to manage damage from NBC attacks, missiles, or collision. Automation supplements but does not replace human judgment in prioritizing damage control efforts.
