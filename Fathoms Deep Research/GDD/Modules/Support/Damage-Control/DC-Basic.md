# Basic Damage Control Party

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | DC-001 |
| **Era** | 1900-Present |
| **Category** | Damage Control |
| **Weight** | 500 kg (equipment) |
| **Crew Required** | 4 |

## Description

Dedicated damage control team equipped with basic tools, pumps, and firefighting equipment. Represents organized damage control procedures rather than ad-hoc crew responses. Even this basic level of DC organization significantly improves ship survivability compared to untrained crew improvisation.

## Effect on Gameplay

Provides modest but meaningful improvements to all damage control activities. Repairs complete faster, fires are contained more quickly, and flooding is managed more effectively. The basic DC party establishes the foundation for ship survivability without requiring power or advanced facilities.

## Specifications

| Capability | Bonus |
|------------|-------|
| **Repair Speed** | +10% |
| **Fire Fighting** | +5% faster |
| **Flooding Control** | +5% faster |
| **Damage Assessment** | Basic status reporting |
| **Response Time** | Standard |
| **Equipment** | Hand tools, portable pumps, hoses |

## Equipment Included

### Repair Tools
- Hammers, saws, wrenches
- Wooden plugs and wedges
- Oakum and caulking materials
- Emergency patching materials
- Portable shoring timbers

### Firefighting
- Portable fire extinguishers
- Hoses and nozzles
- Protective clothing
- Emergency breathing apparatus
- Fire axes and pry bars

### Flooding Control
- Portable hand pumps
- Buckets and bailing equipment
- Emergency patches
- Collision mats
- Rope and tackle

## Capabilities

### Damage Repair
- Patch small hull breaches
- Shore up weakened bulkheads
- Emergency machinery repairs
- Secure loose equipment
- Restore watertight integrity

### Fire Fighting
- Combat Class A fires (ordinary combustibles)
- Combat Class B fires (flammable liquids)
- Prevent fire spread
- Cooling adjacent spaces
- Smoke control

### Flooding Management
- Pump flooded compartments
- Seal damaged areas
- Establish drainage systems
- Monitor water levels
- Prevent progressive flooding

## Without DC Party

Ships without organized damage control:
- Rely on ad-hoc crew responses
- Slower, less effective repairs
- Higher casualties from fires
- Greater risk of progressive flooding
- Poor damage assessment
- Uncoordinated response efforts

## Tactical Value

Even basic DC organization:
- Significantly improves combat endurance
- Reduces time out of action
- Increases crew survival
- Enables continued fighting despite damage
- Foundation for all other DC systems

## Limitations

- Manual labor intensive
- No specialized equipment
- Limited against major damage
- No automated systems
- Basic damage assessment only
- Requires crew diversion from other duties
- Limited effectiveness against modern weapons
- No protective features against NBC threats

## Historical Notes

Organized damage control evolved from painful lessons. Early navies had minimal DC training - fires and flooding often doomed ships that could have been saved. The Age of Sail saw some DC practices develop (collision mats, shot plugs), but steam-era ships faced new challenges with machinery spaces and coal bunker fires.

The IJN Mikasa at Tsushima demonstrated effective DC - despite multiple hits, organized crews kept her fighting. Conversely, many Russian ships at Tsushima burned uncontrollably due to poor DC. WWI battle damage revealed ships survived when crews fought fires and floods systematically rather than panicking or abandoning ship prematurely.

The basic DC party represents the minimum organization needed for survivability. Even without advanced equipment or training, having designated personnel with basic tools and clear procedures dramatically improves outcomes. British and American navies in WWII emphasized DC training for all crew - this "every sailor a firefighter" philosophy, combined with organized DC parties, saved countless ships.

Modern navies maintain basic DC parties even on ships with advanced systems, recognizing that equipment can fail but trained personnel with basic tools remain invaluable.
