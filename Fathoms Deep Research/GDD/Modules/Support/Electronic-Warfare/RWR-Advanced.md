# Advanced Radar Warning Receiver

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | EW-002 |
| **Era** | 1960-Present |
| **Category** | Electronic Warfare |
| **Weight** | 120 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 8 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 1 |

## Description

Modern radar warning receiver with comprehensive threat library and advanced signal processing. Identifies specific radar types, prioritizes threats automatically, and provides detailed tactical information. Integrates with combat information center for coordinated defensive response.

## Effect on Gameplay

Provides complete radar threat awareness with automatic identification and prioritization. The system knows exactly what type of radar is illuminating you, what weapons it controls, and how urgent the threat is. Enables sophisticated defensive tactics and coordinated use of countermeasures.

## Specifications

| Capability | Performance |
|------------|-------------|
| **Detection Range** | 3x enemy radar range |
| **Response Time** | Instant (<0.1 sec) |
| **Bearing Accuracy** | ±2 degrees |
| **Threat Library** | 500+ radar emitters |
| **Frequency Coverage** | 100 MHz - 40 GHz |
| **Simultaneous Tracks** | 50+ threats |
| **Update Rate** | 10 Hz |

## Threat Identification

The system identifies:
- **Radar Type**: Search, tracking, fire control, missile guidance
- **Platform**: Ship class, aircraft type, missile system
- **Weapon System**: Associated weapons and capabilities
- **Threat Level**: Automatic prioritization
- **Engagement Timeline**: Time to weapon impact

## Display Integration

When integrated with CIC:
- **Threat Board**: All detected radars with priority ranking
- **Azimuth Display**: 360-degree threat picture
- **Recommended Actions**: Automated countermeasure suggestions
- **Engagement Zones**: When threats can fire
- **Missile Warning**: Specific alert for missile guidance radars

## Advanced Features

### Signal Intelligence
- Radar parameter analysis (PRF, scan rate, etc.)
- Electronic order of battle compilation
- New emitter detection and classification
- Emission control violation detection

### Automatic Responses
- Triggers defensive systems automatically
- Cues jammers to optimal settings
- Initiates chaff/flare sequences
- Alerts weapons systems for hard-kill response

### Networking
- Shares threat data with task force
- Receives threat library updates
- Contributes to joint EOB picture

## Tactical Applications

1. **Threat Prioritization**: Focus on most dangerous radars
2. **Countermeasure Optimization**: Jam the right threats
3. **Defensive Maneuvering**: Evade based on threat geometry
4. **Emission Control**: Know when you're being watched
5. **Intelligence Gathering**: Build enemy radar database

## Limitations

- Requires regular threat library updates
- Cannot detect passive sensors (ESM, visual, etc.)
- Effective jamming can blind the receiver
- New/unknown radars require time to classify
- Does not provide range information (bearing only)

## Historical Notes

Advanced RWR systems emerged in the 1960s as missile threats proliferated and electronic warfare became crucial to survival. The AN/SLR-25 aboard US Navy ships could identify Soviet radar types and prioritize threats, giving crews critical seconds to respond. During the Falklands War, British ships with modern RWR systems detected Argentine Super Étendard aircraft emissions before Exocet missile launches, though not always with enough warning.

The 1980s saw dramatic improvements with digital signal processing and comprehensive threat libraries. The AN/SLQ-32 became the standard US Navy RWR/ESM suite, capable of identifying hundreds of emitters and automatically cueing countermeasures. Modern systems use sophisticated algorithms to fingerprint radars by their unique emission characteristics, even when standard parameters change.

The networked RWR concept allows entire task forces to share threat information, creating a composite picture far more detailed than any single ship could generate. This "cooperative engagement" approach has become standard in modern naval warfare.
