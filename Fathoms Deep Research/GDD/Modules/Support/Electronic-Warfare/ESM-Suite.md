# ESM Suite

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | EWR-003 |
| **Era** | 1960+ |
| **Category** | Electronic Warfare |
| **Weight** | 600 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 15 kW |

## Description

Electronic Support Measures (ESM) system that passively detects, identifies, and classifies enemy electronic emissions. Unlike radar warning receivers that simply alert to detection, ESM suites analyze signals to determine radar types, ship classes, and even individual platform identification. The system operates passively, providing intelligence without revealing your presence.

Modern ESM integrates sophisticated signal processing, threat libraries, and automatic classification. The system detects radar, communication signals, and even electronic countermeasures, building a complete electronic order of battle picture. ESM provides early warning of threats before they detect you, as receiving systems detect emissions at much greater ranges than radar can detect targets.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Passive Detection**: Detect enemy radar emissions at 2x radar range
- **Threat Classification**: Identify ship types by their emissions
- **Early Warning**: Know enemies are present before they detect you
- **Bearing to Emitter**: Direction to detected platforms
- **Emission Analysis**: Identify weapon systems and capabilities
- **Silent Operation**: Your ESM does not reveal your position

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Detection Range | 100-200 km (against surface search radar) |
| Frequency Coverage | 0.5-40 GHz |
| Classification Database | 1000+ radar types |
| Bearing Accuracy | ±2-5 degrees |
| Processing Time | <1 second for known emitters |
| Simultaneous Tracks | 50+ emitters |
| Direction Finding | Integrated (bearing only, no range) |
| Passive Operation | Does not emit (undetectable) |

## Advantages

- Detects enemies before they detect you
- Passive operation (covert)
- Extremely long detection range
- Identifies ship types and capabilities
- Provides tactical warning time
- Works continuously without revealing position
- Builds intelligence picture
- Can detect non-radar emissions (datalinks, etc.)
- Critical for "first look" advantage
- Enables informed tactical decisions

## Disadvantages

- Bearing only (no range information)
- Only detects emitting platforms
- Cannot detect ships in EMCON (emissions control)
- Requires extensive threat library maintenance
- Complex system requiring training
- Provides no defense (detection only)
- Can be overwhelmed in high-density environments
- Cannot identify non-emitting threats
- More expensive than simple RWR

## Historical Notes

ESM evolved from WWII radar warning receivers into sophisticated intelligence systems. The Cold War saw rapid development as NATO and Warsaw Pact forces sought to identify and classify opposing forces by their electronic signatures. Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) ships compiled vast databases of radar characteristics.

During the Falklands War (1982), British Type 22 frigates used ESM to detect Argentine forces at extreme range, providing early warning. The system detected Super Etendard aircraft radars before the Argentine planes detected British ships, though the warning came too late for HMS Sheffield.

Modern ESM systems like AN/SLQ-32(V)3 integrate detection, classification, and countermeasure control. Gulf War (1991) operations demonstrated ESM's value in identifying and tracking Iraqi forces in the maritime environment.

## Tactical Tips

- Always operating - provides continuous situational awareness
- Detection at 2x radar range gives you "first look"
- Use ESM bearings with multiple platforms for triangulation
- Ships in EMCON are invisible to ESM
- Build electronic order of battle before engagement
- Identify high-value targets by their sophisticated radars
- Warning of fire control radar activation is critical
- Compare ESM contacts with radar contacts for complete picture
- Can detect enemies over the horizon
- Essential for avoiding ambushes
- Particularly valuable in multiplayer (detect before being detected)
