# Basic Radar Warning Receiver

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | EW-001 |
| **Era** | 1942-1965 |
| **Category** | Electronic Warfare |
| **Weight** | 80 kg |
| **Crew Required** | 1 |

## Description

Early radar warning receiver that detects when enemy radar is scanning your ship. Provides basic warning of radar detection with directional bearing but limited threat classification. Essential for WWII and early Cold War vessels facing radar-equipped opponents.

## Effect on Gameplay

Provides critical situational awareness by alerting you when enemy radar has detected your ship. Gives bearing to radar source and basic classification (search vs fire control), allowing you to take evasive action or activate countermeasures before weapons are fired.

## Specifications

| Capability | Performance |
|------------|-------------|
| **Detection Range** | 2x enemy radar range |
| **Response Time** | <1 second |
| **Bearing Accuracy** | ±15 degrees |
| **Threat Classification** | Search / Fire Control only |
| **Frequency Coverage** | 200 MHz - 10 GHz |
| **Alert Types** | Audio + Visual indicator |

## Warning Display

When enemy radar hits you:
- **Audio Alert**: Tone increases with signal strength
- **Bearing Indicator**: Direction to radar source
- **Alert Level**: Search (low) or Lock (high)
- **Signal Strength**: Relative intensity

## Tactical Applications

1. **Ambush Warning**: Know when you've been spotted
2. **Evasive Action**: Break contact before attack develops
3. **Countermeasure Timing**: Activate jammers when locked
4. **Threat Assessment**: Identify direction of threat

## Limitations

- No specific radar type identification
- Cannot determine range to threat
- Basic bearing accuracy only
- No electronic order of battle (EOB) database
- Cannot distinguish friendly from hostile radar
- Limited frequency coverage compared to modern systems
- No threat prioritization for multiple radars

## Historical Notes

Radar warning receivers emerged during WWII when radar became a primary detection method. German U-boats pioneered the technology with the Metox receiver to detect Allied ASW radar, providing critical warning to dive before aircraft arrived. Surface ships adopted similar systems as radar-guided weapons proliferated. The British Type 650 and American SPR-2 were early naval RWR systems, providing basic warning of radar illumination. These systems saved countless ships by providing seconds of warning before radar-guided shells or missiles arrived.

The technology proved especially valuable in the Pacific theater, where Japanese ships increasingly faced American radar-equipped vessels with night-fighting capabilities. Ships with RWR could detect they were being tracked and take evasive action or activate smoke screens before the enemy achieved firing solutions.
