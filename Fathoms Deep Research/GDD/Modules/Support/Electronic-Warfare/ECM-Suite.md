# ECM Suite

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | EWR-004 |
| **Era** | 1970+ |
| **Category** | Electronic Warfare |
| **Weight** | 1,200 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 60 kW |

## Description

Comprehensive Electronic Countermeasures suite integrating detection, jamming, and decoy control into a unified system. The ECM suite automatically detects threats via ESM, classifies them, selects appropriate countermeasures, and coordinates jamming and chaff deployment. This automated response dramatically reduces reaction time compared to manual operation of separate systems.

Modern ECM suites like AN/SLQ-32(V)3 or Russian Avtobaza systems employ AI-assisted threat evaluation, adaptive jamming techniques, and coordinated multi-layer defense. The system manages power allocation, selects jamming modes, cues chaff launchers, and coordinates with hard-kill defenses like CIWS or missiles. Crew oversight remains essential, but automation enables split-second response to simultaneous threats.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Integrated Defense**: Automated threat response
- **ESM Detection**: Passive detection of emitters at long range
- **Active Jamming**: Automatic jamming of fire control radars
- **Decoy Control**: Coordinated chaff deployment
- **Threat Prioritization**: AI evaluates and prioritizes threats
- **Multi-Threat Handling**: Engage multiple threats simultaneously
- **Reduced Reaction Time**: Responds in <1 second

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Detection Range | 150-250 km (passive ESM) |
| Jamming Power | 5-15 kW per channel |
| Frequency Coverage | 0.5-40 GHz |
| Simultaneous Jamming | 4-8 threats |
| Chaff Integration | Automatic cuing and control |
| Threat Library | 2000+ entries with updates |
| Response Time | <1 second (automated) |
| Effectiveness | -50% enemy radar accuracy when active |

## Advantages

- Fully integrated detection and countermeasures
- Automated response (critical speed advantage)
- Handles multiple simultaneous threats
- Sophisticated jamming techniques
- Coordinates all EW systems
- Reduces crew workload under stress
- AI-assisted threat evaluation
- Continuous threat library updates
- Essential for modern combat
- Can protect nearby ships (extended coverage)
- Synergistic effects (jamming + chaff > sum of parts)

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive system
- High power consumption
- Heavy (affects top-weight)
- Complex maintenance requirements
- Requires regular software updates
- Automation can make unexpected decisions
- High power draw limits endurance
- May interfere with friendly systems if not coordinated
- Vulnerable to new/unknown threats not in database
- Requires extensive crew training despite automation

## Historical Notes

Integrated ECM suites emerged in the 1970s as missile threats proliferated. The US Navy's SLQ-32 entered service in 1972, combining ESM and jamming in one system. Soviet ships deployed similar integrated systems like the Bell series.

The Falklands War (1982) demonstrated ECM's importance - ships with modern suites survived Exocet attacks that sank less-equipped vessels. HMS Glamorgan's ECM may have contributed to an Exocet passing behind her stern rather than striking amidships.

The 1987-88 Tanker War saw extensive ECM use. USS Stark's ECM suite was not activated during the Iraqi Exocet attack that damaged her - a lesson emphasizing the importance of proper employment. The Gulf War (1991) and subsequent conflicts validated ECM as essential for surface ship survival.

## Tactical Tips

- Keep system active in threat environments
- Trust the automation but monitor decisions
- Maintain power reserve for ECM operation
- Update threat libraries before deployment
- Coordinate with allied ships to avoid mutual interference
- ECM active state reveals your presence - consider EMCON
- Works best when combined with hard maneuvers
- Practice emergency procedures for ECM failures
- Backup chaff manual control for automation failure
- Critical for operations in missile threat environment
- Consider power management - ECM draws heavily
- Modern anti-ship missiles are sophisticated - ECM is not guaranteed defense
