# Radar Jammer

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | EWR-001 |
| **Era** | 1943+ |
| **Category** | Electronic Warfare |
| **Weight** | 300 kg |

## Description

Electronic countermeasure system that broadcasts powerful radio frequency energy to disrupt enemy radar. The jammer detects incoming radar signals and retransmits noise or false signals on the same frequency, degrading enemy radar accuracy and making it difficult to establish fire control solutions. Active jamming reveals your presence but denies the enemy precise targeting information.

Early systems employed noise jamming - broadcasting static across radar frequencies. Modern systems use sophisticated deception techniques including false targets, range-gate pull-off, and velocity-gate spoofing. The jammer operator must identify enemy radar types and select appropriate countermeasures.

## Effect on Gameplay

When activated:
- **Enemy Radar Degraded**: -40% accuracy for radar-aimed weapons
- **Fire Control Disruption**: Delays enemy lock-on by 5-10 seconds
- **Detection Trade-off**: You appear on radar but with poor resolution
- **Range Uncertainty**: Enemy range estimates ±500-1000m error
- **Bearing Uncertainty**: ±5-10 degree error in your position

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Effective Range | 30-50 km (affects radars scanning you) |
| Frequency Coverage | 1-18 GHz (typical system) |
| Power Output | 1-10 kW RF power |
| Jamming Modes | Noise, deception, swept-frequency |
| Effectiveness | -40% enemy radar accuracy |
| Burn-Through Range | Enemy can overcome jamming at <5km |
| Power Consumption | 40 kW |

## Advantages

- Significantly reduces enemy radar accuracy
- Degrades fire control radar effectiveness
- Makes you harder to hit with radar-guided weapons
- Can protect nearby allies (sidelobe jamming)
- Works against multiple radar types
- Critical for survival in missile age
- Can delay enemy targeting
- Modern systems very sophisticated

## Disadvantages

- Reveals your presence (you're detected, just poorly)
- High power consumption
- Ineffective against visual aiming
- Can be overcome at close range (burn-through)
- May interfere with friendly systems if not coordinated
- Requires skilled operators
- Less effective vs. frequency-agile radars
- Does not work against passive sensors

## Historical Notes

Radar jamming emerged in 1943 when German ships equipped with crude jammers disrupted Allied fire control radars. The British countered with frequency changes and jammer direction finding. Kamikaze attacks during the Philippines campaign prompted US Navy development of shipboard jammers.

Cold War developments produced sophisticated systems. During the Falklands War (1982), HMS Sheffield's jamming of her own radar frequencies may have prevented early detection of the Exocet missile that sank her - a cautionary tale about jamming coordination.

Modern systems like AN/SLQ-32 integrate threat detection, jamming, and decoy control. The 1988 engagement between USS Vincennes and Iranian vessels demonstrated electronic warfare's importance in modern surface combat.

## Tactical Tips

- Activate when enemy radar locks on (RWR alerts you)
- Jamming reveals you - use when already detected
- Ineffective against visual or infrared tracking
- Combine with chaff for maximum effectiveness
- Coordinate with allies - avoid jamming friendly radars
- Less useful at very close range (burn-through)
- Modern frequency-hopping radars harder to jam
- Essential for operations in missile threat environment
- Power management critical - jammer draws significant power
- Some situations call for stealth over jamming
