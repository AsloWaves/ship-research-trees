# Chaff Launcher

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | EWR-002 |
| **Era** | 1943+ |
| **Category** | Electronic Warfare |
| **Weight** | 450 kg |

## Description

Rapid-deployment system that launches clouds of radar-reflective material (chaff) to confuse enemy radar. Chaff consists of thin metallic strips or metallized fibers cut to specific lengths matching enemy radar wavelengths. When deployed, chaff creates multiple strong radar returns, masking the ship's true position and seducing radar-guided missiles away from their target.

Modern chaff launchers fire pre-packaged cartridges that burst at altitude, dispersing thousands of reflective elements. The resulting cloud creates a large, slow-moving radar target that appears more attractive than the actual ship. Proper timing and wind conditions are critical for effectiveness.

## Effect on Gameplay

When deployed:
- **Radar Decoy**: Creates false target cloud
- **Missile Seduction**: -50% chance enemy missile hits you
- **Limited Duration**: Chaff effective 30-60 seconds
- **Limited Ammunition**: 10-30 rounds depending on system
- **Wind Dependent**: Effectiveness varies with conditions
- **Reloading Required**: Between salvos

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Launcher Type | Multi-barrel mortar or rocket |
| Ammunition Capacity | 10-30 cartridges |
| Deployment Time | 2-3 seconds to fire |
| Chaff Cloud Size | 50-100m radius |
| Effectiveness Duration | 30-60 seconds per cloud |
| Reload Time | 5-10 seconds between salvos |
| Radar Cross Section | Cloud appears 10x larger than ship |
| Wind Sensitivity | High (strong winds disperse rapidly) |

## Advantages

- Highly effective against radar-guided missiles
- Creates instant radar decoy
- Relatively lightweight system
- Low power requirements
- Can be used repeatedly (if ammunition lasts)
- Works against multiple threats simultaneously
- Essential missile defense layer
- Proven combat effectiveness
- Quick deployment
- No warm-up time required

## Disadvantages

- Limited ammunition (expendable)
- Requires resupply between missions
- Effectiveness depends on timing
- Wind can disperse chaff rapidly
- Ineffective against infrared/visual guidance
- Modern frequency-agile radars may discriminate
- Must anticipate incoming missiles
- Does not work against guns or torpedoes
- Chaff clouds visible on your own radar
- Requires practice for effective employment

## Historical Notes

Chaff (called "Window" by the British) was first used by RAF Bomber Command in 1943 to blind German radars over Hamburg. Naval chaff systems emerged in late WWII to counter Japanese kamikaze attacks. The RN-58 chaff rocket became standard USN equipment.

During the Vietnam War, chaff proved highly effective against radar-guided SAMs. The Falklands War (1982) demonstrated chaff's value - HMS Ambuscade successfully seduced Exocet missiles with chaff clouds. Modern conflicts continue to validate chaff as a critical last-ditch defense.

Israeli Navy ships routinely practice chaff deployment. The 2006 Lebanon War saw successful chaff employment against missile threats. Modern systems like Mk 36 SRBOC (Super Rapid Bloom Onboard Chaff) can deploy chaff in under 2 seconds after threat warning.

## Tactical Tips

- Deploy immediately when RWR indicates fire control lock
- Use in conjunction with hard maneuvering
- Multiple chaff clouds increase effectiveness
- Time deployment for missile midcourse phase
- Ineffective if deployed too early (disperses)
- Coordinate with radar jammer for maximum effect
- Practice timing in peacetime
- Maintain ammunition discipline - you have limited shots
- Wind from stern helps chaff separate from ship
- Modern missiles require multiple chaff salvos
- Essential for surviving anti-ship missile attacks
