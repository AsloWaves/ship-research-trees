# Signal Flags

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | COM-001 |
| **Era** | All Eras |
| **Category** | Communications |
| **Weight** | 50 kg |

## Description

International Code of Signals using colored flags hoisted on halyards. Each flag or combination represents letters, numbers, or preset messages. The system enables basic communication between any naval vessels regardless of nation, requiring only visual contact. Flag hoists remain the traditional method for ceremonial and routine communications even in the modern era.

The International Code consists of 26 alphabet flags, 10 numeral pennants, and 3 substitutes, allowing thousands of signal combinations. Common tactical signals ("engage the enemy," "form line ahead," "prepare for action") have standardized meanings. The system is slow but reliable and requires no power or technology.

## Effect on Gameplay

## Historical Notes

Flag signals dominated naval communications until wireless telegraphy emerged around 1900. Admiral Nelson's famous "England expects that every man will do his duty" was transmitted by flag hoist at Trafalgar (1805). Even in WWII, flags remained important for radio silence operations, identification, and fleet maneuvers.

The International Code of Signals was standardized in 1857 and updated in 1901, creating a system usable by all maritime nations. Famous signals include "Tango" (keep clear, engaged in trawling) and "Zulu" (I require a tug), still used today. Modern navies maintain signal flags for ceremonies and as backup communication.

## Tactical Tips

- Use for radio silence operations
- Essential in early eras before radio
- Preset common orders for your fleet
- "Engage the enemy more closely" - instant understanding
- Cannot coordinate beyond visual range
- Keep binoculars ready to read allied signals
- Consider enemy can read them too - no security
- Useful for identification (challenge/reply protocols)
- Night operations require signal lamps instead
- Maintain signal books with standard meanings
