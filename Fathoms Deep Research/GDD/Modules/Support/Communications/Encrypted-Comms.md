# Encrypted Communications

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | COM-004 |
| **Era** | 1940+ |
| **Category** | Communications |
| **Weight** | 450 kg |

## Description

Secure voice and data communication system using encryption to prevent enemy interception. Early systems employed mechanical cipher machines (like SIGABA or Typex), while modern systems use digital encryption protocols. Encrypted communications allow coordination without revealing tactical information to the enemy, though the act of transmitting still reveals your general presence.

The system adds encryption/decryption hardware to standard radio equipment. Messages are scrambled before transmission and unscrambled by allied receivers with matching key material. Without the proper keys, intercepted messages are meaningless noise.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed with compatible radio systems:
- **Secure Voice**: Enemy cannot understand your communications
- **Tactical Security**: Coordinate without information leakage
- **Strategic Planning**: Discuss plans without enemy awareness
- **Direction Finding Still Works**: Enemy knows you transmitted, not content
- **Requires Matching Systems**: Allies need encryption too

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Encryption Method | Era-dependent (mechanical to digital) |
| Processing Delay | 0.5-2 seconds |
| Security Level | High (unbreakable with period tech) |
| Key Management | Requires secure key distribution |
| Compatibility | Allied forces with same system |
| Power Overhead | +5 kW vs. standard radio |
| Reliability | 90% (equipment dependent) |

## Advantages

- Enemy cannot understand your transmissions
- Enables secure tactical coordination
- Prevents intelligence leakage
- Critical for ambush operations
- Allows detailed planning over radio
- Protects fleet movements
- Prevents enemy reaction to your plans
- Modern systems very secure

## Disadvantages

- Heavier and more complex than plain radio
- Higher power consumption
- Processing delay (slight)
- Requires key distribution and management
- Both sender and receiver need compatible systems
- Equipment failures compromise security
- Direction finding still locates you
- More expensive than plain radio

## Historical Notes

WWII drove encryption technology forward rapidly. The US Navy's ECM (Electric Cipher Machine) provided secure voice, while SIGABA encrypted message traffic. German Enigma machines were famously compromised, but naval Enigma remained secure longer than Wehrmacht versions due to additional complexity.

The British Type X (Typex) cipher machine proved highly secure throughout WWII. Post-war, electronic encryption systems like KW-7 and later KG-84 provided increasingly sophisticated security. Modern Link 16 and similar systems integrate encryption seamlessly into tactical data networks.

The Cold War saw encryption become standard on all combatants. During the Falklands War (1982), British encrypted communications prevented Argentine intelligence from understanding British task force intentions despite intercepting transmissions.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential for competitive multiplayer (prevents eavesdropping)
- Coordinate ambushes without alerting enemy
- Remember: encryption hides content, not that you transmitted
- Maintain radio discipline even with encryption
- Manage encryption keys securely
- Test systems before operations
- Have backup plain voice capability
- Particularly valuable in competitive fleet battles
- Cannot help if enemy has visual contact
- Use alongside EMCON (emissions control) for maximum stealth
