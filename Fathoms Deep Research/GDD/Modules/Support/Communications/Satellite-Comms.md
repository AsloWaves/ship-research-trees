# Satellite Communications

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | COM-005 |
| **Era** | 1970+ |
| **Category** | Communications |
| **Weight** | 800 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 25 kW |

## Description

Global communications via military satellite networks. Satellite terminals provide reliable worldwide voice, data, and video links regardless of range or atmospheric conditions. Systems like DSCS (Defense Satellite Communications System), Milstar, and modern WGS (Wideband Global SATCOM) ensure constant connectivity with fleet command and allied forces anywhere on Earth.

The ship-mounted terminal features stabilized antenna systems that track satellites despite ship motion. Links operate in SHF (Super High Frequency) and EHF (Extremely High Frequency) bands, offering high bandwidth and resistance to jamming. Modern systems integrate encryption and anti-jam features as standard.

## Effect on Gameplay

When installed:
- **Global Range**: Communicate anywhere on the map
- **Always Connected**: Reliable 24/7 communications
- **High Bandwidth**: Voice, data, and video simultaneously
- **Weather Immune**: Operates in all conditions
- **Strategic Integration**: Direct link to fleet command
- **Mission Updates**: Real-time intelligence and orders

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Range | Global (satellite dependent) |
| Frequency | 7-45 GHz (SHF/EHF) |
| Data Rate | 1-50 Mbps (system dependent) |
| Voice Quality | Excellent |
| Latency | 250-500ms (satellite delay) |
| Reliability | 95% |
| Jamming Resistance | High (frequency hopping, EHF) |
| Encryption | Built-in (modern standards) |

## Advantages

- Truly global communications
- Works anywhere on Earth
- Immune to atmospheric interference
- High bandwidth for complex data
- Integrated encryption
- Difficult to jam (EHF systems)
- Reliable in all weather
- Enables network-centric warfare
- Video conferencing capability
- Direct link to national command

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive equipment
- High power consumption
- Requires satellite infrastructure
- Slight transmission delay (latency)
- Large antenna system
- Complex maintenance
- Satellite availability limited (coverage gaps pre-1990s)
- Early systems vulnerable to jamming
- Reveals you're transmitting (electronic warfare detection)

## Historical Notes

Naval satellite communications began with the US Navy's FLTSATCOM system in the 1970s. These UHF satellites provided the first reliable global fleet communications. During the Falklands War (1982), British forces used SKYNET satellites for strategic coordination with London.

The Gulf War (1991) demonstrated satellite communications' importance - US Navy ships had real-time connectivity for coordination and intelligence. Modern systems like Milstar and WGS provide jam-resistant, high-bandwidth links supporting network-centric operations.

China's destruction of a satellite in 2007 highlighted the vulnerability of space-based systems. Modern navies maintain HF radio and other backups in case satellite networks are compromised.

## Tactical Tips

- Essential for modern era operations
- Provides strategic situational awareness
- Enables coordination with air and ground forces
- Use for high-level command communications
- VHF/UHF still better for local tactical coordination
- Latency makes it less ideal for time-critical orders
- Critical for intelligence updates and targeting data
- Enables "over the horizon" targeting
- Consider EMCON protocols - SATCOM is detectable
- Maintain HF radio as backup if satellites lost
- Particularly valuable in distant operations
