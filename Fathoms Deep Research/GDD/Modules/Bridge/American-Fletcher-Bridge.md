## Historical Notes

The Fletcher-class destroyer bridge represents the pinnacle of WWII destroyer design. Unlike ships designed for a specific role, Fletcher-class destroyers excelled at everything - surface combat, anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, shore bombardment, and escort duty. The radar-optimized bridge integrated comprehensive electronics with practical American ergonomics. The CIC provided destroyer captains with better information than many larger ships. Fletcher-class destroyers fought in every major Pacific engagement, earning 15 Medals of Honor and countless battle stars. The class's combination of capability, reliability, and survivability made it the most successful destroyer design in history, with many serving into the 1970s and influencing destroyer design for decades.
