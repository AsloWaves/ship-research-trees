## Historical Notes

American fleet submarines executed the most successful submarine campaign in history. While German U-boats grabbed headlines, American submarines quietly strangled Japan's island economy. Operating from Pearl Harbor, Australia, and forward bases, fleet submarines prowled Japanese waters with increasing impunity. The combination of reliable boats, excellent TDC, radar integration, and (eventually) working torpedoes devastated Japanese shipping. By 1945, Japan's merchant fleet was virtually extinct, oil imports had ceased, and the home islands were starving. The fleet submarine force, comprising only 2% of the US Navy, accounted for 55% of Japanese losses. The silent service paid dearly - 52 boats lost - but achieved strategic victory that made Japan's defeat inevitable even before the atomic bombs fell.
