## Historical Notes

PT boats operated primarily at night, using speed and surprise to attack larger ships with torpedoes. The small, open helm gave skippers like John F. Kennedy (PT-109) excellent visibility for split-second maneuvering in the confined waters of the Solomon Islands. The lack of sophisticated instruments meant PT boat combat was intensely personal and required exceptional seamanship.

## Suitable Ships

- PT boats (USA)
- Motor Torpedo Boats (UK)
- S-Boats/E-Boats (Germany)
- Fast attack craft (all nations)
