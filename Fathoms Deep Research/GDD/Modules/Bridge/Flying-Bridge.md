## Historical Notes

Flying bridges became standard on warships from 1900 onward as ship sizes increased and main bridges became more enclosed. The raised platform gave the captain an unobstructed view for ship handling. During WWII, US destroyer captains often commanded from the flying bridge during surface actions for better visibility, accepting the risk. The famous photo of Admiral Halsey during Typhoon Cobra shows him on New Jersey's flying bridge in extreme conditions.

## Suitable Ships

- Destroyers (primary during maneuvering)
- Cruisers (auxiliary position)
- Battleships (auxiliary position)
- All surface vessels

## Compatibility
