## Damage Considerations

Priority Target: Enemy will target flagships
Redundancy: Multiple command stations
Transfer: Can transfer flag if damaged
Communication Loss: Fleet loses coordination
```

## Historical Notes

The Flag Bridge became essential as fleets grew beyond visual signal range. At Jutland (1916), Jellicoe commanded the Grand Fleet from Iron Duke's flag bridge, receiving reports from scouting forces by radio. The Flag Bridge allowed admirals to focus on the big picture while captains handled their own ships. Modern flagships like USS Blue Ridge are purpose-built command ships with massive communication and planning facilities.

## Suitable Ships

- Heavy cruisers
- Aircraft carriers (modern)
- Amphibious command ships
- Purpose-built command ships
