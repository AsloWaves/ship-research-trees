## Historical Notes

Modern carrier islands grew substantially larger than WWII equivalents to accommodate advanced electronics and command facilities. The Nimitz-class island is over 150 feet tall. The newest Ford-class carriers feature a redesigned, smaller island moved further aft to improve flight deck efficiency. The island houses enough electronics to require dedicated cooling systems - an island hit can blind the entire battle group.

## Suitable Ships

- Supercarriers (CVN)
- Large conventional carriers (CV)
