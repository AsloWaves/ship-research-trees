## Historical Notes

The American carrier island represented the USN's philosophy of comprehensive capability over minimal interference. While British and Japanese carriers emphasized smaller islands to maximize flight deck area, American carriers built large, fully-equipped islands with complete radar coverage, extensive CIC facilities, and flag accommodations. This approach proved superior in combat, enabling the coordinated multi-carrier operations that dominated the Pacific War. The CIC-directed fighter defenses decimated Japanese air attacks, while American air operations achieved efficiency that British and Japanese carriers couldn't match. The large American island, once criticized as inefficient, became the standard that all post-war carrier designs followed.
