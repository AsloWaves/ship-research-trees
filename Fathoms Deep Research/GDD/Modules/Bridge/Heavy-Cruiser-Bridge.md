# Heavy Cruiser Bridge

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | BRG-T02 |
| **Era** | 1925-1960 |
| **Weight** | 18,000 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 30 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 15 |

## Description

A balanced bridge design for heavy cruisers (CA) and large cruisers (CB), optimizing the compromise between protection, visibility, and capability. Larger than destroyer bridges but more compact than battleship command bridges, this design provides excellent scouting capability, fire control integration, and enough space for squadron flagship duties when needed.

The heavy cruiser bridge emphasizes independent operations, long-range navigation, and the ability to coordinate with other forces while maintaining its own combat effectiveness. Typical of treaty cruisers built under Washington and London Naval Treaty restrictions.

## Historical Notes

The heavy cruiser bridge design evolved from the Washington Naval Treaty (1922) which created the 10,000-ton, 8-inch gun cruiser category. Ships like USS Pensacola, HMS Kent, IJN Myoko, and Admiral Hipper featured bridges balancing many requirements: independent scouting, fleet screening, surface combat, and AA defense.

These bridges had to support cruisers operating alone for extended periods while also integrating with fleet operations. The design emphasis was on excellent navigation, good communications, and effective fire control without the weight penalty of battleship-style facilities.

Treaty cruisers often served as squadron flagships, requiring command facilities without the full admiral's staff of a battleship. Most could accommodate a rear admiral and small staff for cruiser division command (4-6 ships).

Typical heavy cruiser bridge arrangements:
- **USS Baltimore** (1943): Modern design with integrated radar, CIC space, good AA coordination
- **HMS Kent** (1928): Traditional enclosed bridge, retrofitted with radar 1941
- **IJN Myoko** (1929): Japanese design with excellent optics, tall fire control tower
- **KMS Admiral Hipper** (1939): German compact design with good protection

The heavy cruiser bridge proved adaptable. Most WWII heavy cruisers received radar retrofits without major structural changes, adding radar displays to the existing plotting room.

## Suitable Ships

### Primary Users
- Heavy cruisers (CA): 8-inch gun, 10,000-13,000 tons
- Large cruisers (CB): Alaska-class, super-cruisers
- Treaty cruisers (Washington/London type)
- Armored cruisers (late era)

### Specific Examples
- Baltimore-class CA
- Pensacola/New Orleans/Portland-class CA
- County-class CA (UK)
- Zara-class CA (Italy)
- Admiral Hipper-class CA (Germany)
- Myoko/Takao-class CA (Japan)
- Alaska-class CB (large cruiser)

### Not Recommended
- Light cruisers (use Light-Cruiser-Bridge)
- Battleships (need Battleship-Command-Bridge)
- Destroyers (too heavy)
- Carriers (need island design)

## Prerequisites

### Technology Required
- Gyrocompass technology (1920s)
- Fire control computer (mechanical)
- Radio communications (1920s)
- Optical fire control directors
- Electrical systems (30+ kW)

### Infrastructure
- Medium fabrication capability
- Armor plate for splinter shields
- Precision optical workshop
- Radio installation
- Fire control system integration

### Crew Training
- Naval academy graduates
- Advanced navigation school
- Fire control specialization
- Communications training
- Squadron operations training

## Upgrade Options

### Equipment Additions
Can be enhanced with:
- Surface search radar (1940+) → immediate benefit
- Air search radar (1942+) → fleet screening
- Fire control radar (1942+) → gun accuracy
- IFF systems (1943+)
- TBS radio (1941+)
- RWR equipment (1944+)
- Improved fire control computers

### Modernization Paths

- Full radar upgrade → modern search/track capability
- Digital systems → [[Modern-Bridge]] (major refit)

### Specialized Configurations
- Enhanced flagship → Limited [[Flagship-Bridge]] capability
- AA cruiser variant → Additional AA coordination
- Radar picket → Extra radar systems, longer tracking

## Operational Considerations

### Advantages
- Excellent all-around capability
- Good protection/visibility balance
- Independent operations capable
- Squadron coordination possible
- Long-range missions supported
- Good fire control integration
- Reasonable weight/crew

### Limitations
- Not full flagship capability

- Long-range reconnaissance
- Fleet eyes and ears
- Report enemy positions
- Shadow enemy forces

**Surface Combat**
- Gun duels with enemy cruisers

- Surface action group leader

**Fleet Screening**
- AA defense (with proper equipment)
- Anti-submarine screen
- Picket duty
- Squadron coordination

**Shore Bombardment**
- Fire support
- Landing support
- Coastal targets
- Good fire control for accuracy
