## Historical Notes

Merchant bridges remained relatively simple compared to warship equivalents. During WWII, Liberty ships had basic bridges with minimal equipment - a compass, engine telegraph, and perhaps a basic radar late in the war. Merchant mariners faced submarines and aircraft with little more than a lookout's binoculars. The bridge was positioned for cargo visibility rather than combat, making convoy duty particularly hazardous.
