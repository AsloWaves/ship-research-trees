# Light Cruiser Bridge

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | BRG-T03 |
| **Era** | 1920-1960 |
| **Weight** | 12,000 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 25 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 12 |

## Description

A streamlined bridge design for light cruisers (CL) and anti-aircraft cruisers (CLAA), emphasizing speed of operations, AA fire coordination, and fleet screening duties. Lighter than heavy cruiser bridges but more capable than destroyer bridges, this design provides excellent situational awareness and rapid decision-making capability.

The light cruiser bridge prioritizes quick reactions and coordination of multiple weapon systems, especially anti-aircraft batteries. Many WWII light cruisers served as AA escorts for carriers, requiring superior air search capability and AA fire control integration.

## Historical Notes

Light cruiser bridges evolved significantly during WWII. Early designs like USS Brooklyn (1937) had traditional enclosed bridges with optical fire control. By 1944, ships like USS Oakland (CLAA) had radar-festooned bridges with integrated CIC spaces and sophisticated AA coordination.

The Atlanta-class AA cruisers (CLAA) represented specialized light cruiser bridge design. With 12-16 x 5-inch/38 DP guns, these ships needed exceptional AA coordination. Their bridges featured:
- Large SK air search radar
- Multiple fire control radars
- Integrated AA plotting
- Fighter direction capability
- TBS for carrier coordination

Cleveland-class light cruisers (1942-1945) became the standard USN light cruiser. Their bridges balanced gun and AA capability, serving effectively as carrier escorts and bombardment ships. The bridge could coordinate:
- Main battery (12 x 6-inch/47)
- Secondary AA (12 x 5-inch/38)
- Light AA (28+ x 40mm, 10+ x 20mm)
- CAP fighters (via fighter direction)

British light cruisers like HMS Belfast and the Dido-class featured compact bridges with excellent visibility for North Atlantic operations. The Town-class (Southampton, Gloucester, etc.) had particularly good bridges for fleet screening.

Japanese light cruisers like Agano-class featured tall pagoda-style observation towers similar to their battleships, providing excellent long-range visibility for scouting operations.

## Suitable Ships

### Primary Users
- Light cruisers (CL): 6-inch guns, 6,000-12,000 tons
- Anti-aircraft cruisers (CLAA): 5-inch DP guns
- Scout cruisers
