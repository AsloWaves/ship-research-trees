# Submarine Sail (Modern)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | BRG-009 |
| **Era** | 1955-Present |
| **Weight** | 15,000 kg |
| **Power Draw** | 50 kW |
| **Crew Required** | 4 |
| **Pressure Depth** | 400m |

## Description

Streamlined fairwater housing multiple masts (periscopes, radar, ESM, communications) on modern nuclear and advanced conventional submarines. The sail provides the "eyes and ears" at periscope depth while the control room below manages all operations.

## Fog of War - Submerged

- **Base Visibility**: Passive sonar sphere (excellent)
- **Detection Range**: 30+ km passive, 15+ km active
- **Stealth**: Superior quieting, difficult to detect

## Fog of War - Periscope Depth

- **Mast Options**: Periscope, radar, ESM, comms
- **Brief Exposure**: Masts retract quickly
- **Data Burst**: Can receive satellite comms

## Special Features

### Multiple Masts
| Mast | Function |
|------|----------|
| Attack Periscope | Visual targeting |
| Search Periscope | Wide-angle observation |
| Radar Mast | Surface/air search |
| ESM Mast | Electronic surveillance |
| Comms Mast | Satellite/radio |

### Spherical Sonar Array
- Bow-mounted passive array
- 360° coverage
- Long-range detection
- Target motion analysis

### Towed Array Capable
- Ultra-long-range passive
- Detects at 50+ km
- Cannot operate at high speed

### Fire Control System
- Integrates all sensors
- Manages multiple weapons
- Torpedoes + missiles
- Automated tracking

## Operational Modes

### Deep Patrol
- Maximum stealth
- Passive sonar only
- Towed array deployed
- Communications limited

### Periscope Depth
- Full sensor access
- Communications possible
- Higher detection risk
- Attack position

### Surface Transit
- Maximum speed
- Full communications
- Very vulnerable
- Rare in combat

## Damage Resistance

```
Pressure Hull: Rated to 400m+
Torpedo Hit: Likely fatal
Depth Charge: Very dangerous
Collision: Hull damage
```

## Historical Notes

The modern submarine sail evolved from the conning tower as submarines became larger and more capable. Nuclear submarines like the USS Nautilus (1954) pioneered the streamlined sail design. Modern sails are carefully shaped to minimize hydrodynamic drag and flow noise. The sail houses retractable masts rather than fixed periscopes, allowing the boat to operate deeper while still accessing sensors when needed.

## Suitable Ships

- Nuclear attack submarines (SSN)
- Nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBN)
- Advanced conventional submarines (SSK)
