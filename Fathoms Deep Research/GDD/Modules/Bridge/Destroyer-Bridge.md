## Historical Notes

Destroyer bridges evolved from simple open platforms to sophisticated command centers. WWII destroyers like the Fletcher-class had relatively small bridges but packed in radar, fire control, and communications gear. The compact space meant the captain, navigator, and key officers worked in close proximity, enabling rapid tactical decisions. Many destroyer captains preferred to conn from the open bridge wing despite the danger, valuing visibility over protection.
