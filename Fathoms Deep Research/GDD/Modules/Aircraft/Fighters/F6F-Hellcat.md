## Historical Background

The Grumman F6F Hellcat was designed specifically to counter the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, incorporating lessons learned from early Pacific War combat. The result was a robust, powerful fighter that became the dominant carrier aircraft of 1943-1945.

With a 19:1 kill ratio, the Hellcat was credited with destroying more enemy aircraft than any other Allied naval aircraft. Its combination of speed, firepower, protection, and ease of handling made it the preferred mount for Navy aces like David McCampbell (34 kills).

The Hellcat's rugged construction allowed it to absorb significant damage and return to the carrier - a critical advantage in long-range Pacific operations where damaged aircraft often couldn't divert to land bases.
