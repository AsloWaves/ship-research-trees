## Historical Background

The 127mm/50 Type 3 was the standard destroyer main gun for the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Originally designed in 1914, the weapon went through numerous modifications but remained the backbone of Japanese destroyer armament throughout the war.

The Type 3 was designed primarily for surface engagements rather than anti-aircraft work. Its limited maximum elevation of 55° (in most mounts) made it less effective against aircraft compared to contemporary American 5"/38 dual-purpose guns. This deficiency contributed to heavy Japanese destroyer losses to air attack during the later war years.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for game balance*

- **Role**: Anti-surface, limited AA capability
- **Strengths**: High velocity, good accuracy, fast shells
- **Weaknesses**: Poor elevation, limited AA effectiveness, lower ROF than US 5"/38
- **Historical Accuracy**: High - reflects IJN design philosophy prioritizing surface combat
- **Comparable Weapons**: 5"/38 Mark 12 (better AA), 4.7" Mark XII (similar role)

### Special Considerations
- Limited max elevation historically hampered AA effectiveness
- Japanese destroyers relied on torpedoes as primary striking power
- Gun primarily used for surface engagements and illumination
