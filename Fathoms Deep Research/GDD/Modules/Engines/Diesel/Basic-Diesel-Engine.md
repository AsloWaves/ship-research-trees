# Basic Diesel Engine

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-015 |
| **Era** | 1910-Present |
| **Power Output** | 4,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 85% |
| **Weight** | 65 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Diesel |

## Description

The basic marine diesel engine represents the workhouse of naval auxiliary and small combatant propulsion. Unlike steam turbines that require boilers, condensers, and complex systems, a diesel engine simply burns fuel directly in its cylinders to drive pistons. This simplicity makes diesels ideal for ships where reliability and fuel economy matter more than peak performance.

Marine diesels typically operate at 300-600 RPM, driving propellers through simple reduction gearing. The engine is slow, heavy, and produces noticeable vibration - but it's extraordinarily reliable and economical. A diesel-powered patrol boat can operate for weeks on fuel that would keep a turbine destroyer running for days. This economic advantage made diesels standard for submarines, auxiliaries, escorts, and patrol craft throughout the 20th century.

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Low-Medium | Adequate for small ships |
| Efficiency | Excellent | Best fuel economy |
| Weight | Medium | Heavy for power output |
| Reliability | Excellent | Simple, proven design |
| Noise | Moderate-High | Diesel rumble and vibration |
| Maintenance | Low | Straightforward service |

## Advantages
- Outstanding fuel economy (3x better than steam)
- Extremely reliable and durable
- Simple to operate and maintain
- No boilers or steam systems needed
- Diesel fuel safer than gasoline
- Ready to operate (no warm-up time)
- Low crew requirements
- Proven over decades of service

## Disadvantages
- Low power-to-weight ratio
- Noticeable vibration
- Diesel exhaust smell and smoke
- Limited maximum power output
- Not suitable for high-speed operations
- Heavier than turbines for equivalent power

## Historical Notes

Marine diesels first appeared in submarines around 1910, where their fuel economy was revolutionary. Germany's U-boats relied on diesels for surface propulsion, giving them transcontinental range. Between the wars, diesels spread to auxiliaries, patrol boats, and coastal vessels where economy trumped speed.

During WWII, diesel engines proved their worth in corvettes, submarines, and landing craft. The reliable, economical engines powered thousands of small combatants and auxiliaries. Post-war, diesels became standard for frigates, patrol boats, and all manner of auxiliary vessels. Modern marine diesels produce far more power than early models but retain the fundamental advantages of simplicity and economy.

## Typical Applications

**Submarines**: Surface propulsion (with battery for submerged)
**Corvettes/Frigates**: Main propulsion for ASW patrols
**Patrol Boats**: Ideal for long-endurance patrols
**Auxiliaries**: Tankers, tenders, supply ships
**Landing Craft**: Reliability essential

## Compatible Ships
- Submarines (surface propulsion)
- Corvettes and frigates
- Patrol boats and subchasers
- Minesweepers
- Auxiliaries and supply ships
- Landing craft
- Coastal defense vessels

## Fuel Economy Example

On 1,000 nm patrol:
- Basic Diesel: ~8-10 tons fuel
- Geared Turbine: ~25-30 tons fuel
- Gas Turbine: ~35-40 tons fuel

## Upgrade Path

→ [[Diesel-Electric-Drive]] (with batteries for silent running)
→ [[Opposed-Piston-Diesel]] (more advanced diesel)
