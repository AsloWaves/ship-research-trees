# Triple Expansion Engine (Small)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-001 |
| **Type** | Reciprocating Steam |
| **Era** | 1890-1920 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 5,000 SHP |

## Description

Compact triple expansion engine designed for destroyers and torpedo boats. Uses high, intermediate, and low pressure cylinders to extract maximum energy from steam. This smaller variant trades overall power for reduced weight and space requirements, making it ideal for fast, small combatants.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 5,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Slow |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Average |
| **Reliability** | 92% |
| **Noise Level** | Moderate-High |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (12kt) | 1.8 tons/day | 3,500 nm |
| Flank (25kt) | 7.5 tons/day | 800 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     5,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~25 knots (on small hulls)
Acceleration:     Slow (4 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.75 kg coal per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.1x (slightly improved)
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Destroyers (pre-WWI)
- Torpedo boats
- Small protected cruisers
- Dispatch vessels
- Colonial gunboats

## Advantages

- Compact design fits small hulls
- Lighter weight than standard triple expansion
- Excellent reliability for size
- Fully reversible for maneuvering
- Simple maintenance requirements

## Disadvantages

- Limited power output restricts ship size
- Coal firing requires large crew
- Slow acceleration hampers combat maneuvers
- Vibration affects accuracy at high speeds
- High fuel consumption at flank speed

## Historical Notes

Small triple expansion engines powered the destroyer flotillas of the pre-dreadnought era. British "30-knotters" and early American destroyers typically mounted two such engines driving twin screws. The compact design allowed high speed in vessels under 400 tons displacement.

Notable destroyers like HMS Havock (1893) and USS Bainbridge (1902) used similar powerplants. These engines proved remarkably reliable, with some units remaining in service through WWI despite the availability of turbines. The reciprocating action did cause significant vibration, which destroyer crews learned to tolerate as part of life aboard these small, fast vessels.

## Compatible Ships

- Early destroyers (1890-1915)
- Torpedo boat destroyers
- Scout cruisers (small)
- River gunboats

## Upgrade Path

→ [[Parsons-Turbine]] (revolutionary upgrade)
→ [[Geared-Turbine-Light]] (modern destroyer power)
