# Geared Steam Turbine

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-004 |
| **Era** | 1915-1960 |
| **Power Output** | 30,000 SHP per unit |
| **Efficiency** | 70% |
| **Weight** | 200 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Oil |

## Description

The geared turbine solves the fundamental problem of early turbines: turbines are most efficient at high RPM, but propellers are most efficient at low RPM. Reduction gearing allows turbines to spin at optimal speed while driving propellers at their optimal speed.

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     30,000 SHP (per engine)
Max Ship Speed:   ~33 knots (depends on hull)
Acceleration:     Moderate (3 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.35 kg oil per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     2.0x (double baseline)
```

## Characteristics

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Very High | Standard WWII powerplant |
| Efficiency | Good | Major improvement over direct drive |
| Weight | Medium | Compact for power output |
| Reliability | Good | Mature technology by WWII |
| Noise | Low | Smooth turbine operation |
| Maintenance | Moderate | Gearbox requires attention |

## Advantages

- Excellent power-to-weight ratio
- Oil fuel (cleaner, easier to handle)
- Smooth power delivery
- Good fuel efficiency
- Compact machinery spaces

## Disadvantages

- Complex gearing systems
- Not reversible (requires separate astern turbines)
- Vulnerable to shock damage
- Requires skilled engineering crew

## Historical Notes

The geared turbine became the standard warship powerplant by WWI and remained dominant through WWII. The US Navy standardized on geared turbines for all major combatants. The combination of high power, good efficiency, and reasonable weight made it ideal for fast battleships and carriers.

## Famous Examples

- USS Iowa: 212,000 SHP from 4 geared turbines
- IJN Yamato: 150,000 SHP from 4 geared turbines
- HMS Vanguard: 130,000 SHP from 4 geared turbines

## Compatible Ships

- Fast battleships
- Aircraft carriers
- Heavy cruisers
- Light cruisers
- Fleet destroyers
