# Turbo-Electric Drive

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-009 |
| **Type** | Turbo-Electric |
| **Era** | 1915-1945 |
| **Nation** | United States |
| **Power Output** | 28,000 SHP |

## Description

Unique American propulsion system where steam turbines drive electrical generators, which power electric motors connected to propeller shafts. This indirect drive system offers exceptional maneuvering capability and precise speed control at the cost of weight and efficiency. The US Navy extensively used turbo-electric drive in battleships and carriers from WWI through WWII.

```

## Suitable Ship Types

- US battleships (1915-1923)
- Fleet carriers (early US)
- Heavy cruisers (some US)
- Oilers and support ships
- Large transports

## Advantages

- Exceptional maneuvering - instant speed control
- Can reverse at full power instantly
- Precise speed control (1/10 knot increments)
- Turbines run at optimal RPM always
- Each propeller independently controllable
- Excellent reliability (no reduction gears)
- Reduces vibration further than geared turbines
- Superior for aircraft carrier operations

## Disadvantages

- Heavy (electrical machinery adds 20% weight)
- Less efficient than direct geared turbines
- Complex electrical systems require specialists
- Generator/motor conversion loses ~8% power
- Expensive to build and maintain
- Large machinery space requirements
- Vulnerable to electrical failures
- Obsolete by 1940s standards

## Historical Notes

The US Navy pioneered turbo-electric drive with USS New Mexico (1918) and USS Tennessee (1920) battleships, followed by USS Lexington and Saratoga carriers (1927). The system's attraction was precise speed control - crucial for maintaining carrier formation and aircraft launch operations. Battleship captains appreciated the instant response for gunnery positioning.

USS Saratoga's turbo-electric plant produced 180,000 SHP through eight turbine-generator sets powering four electric motors. This configuration allowed independent propeller control, giving exceptional maneuverability for a 36,000-ton carrier. During WWII operations, Saratoga's precise speed control proved valuable for flight operations, maintaining exact wind-over-deck for launches.

The New Mexico class battleships demonstrated turbo-electric advantages during fleet maneuvers. Ships could maintain precise station-keeping, crucial for formation gunnery. The instant reversibility allowed rapid emergency stops - USS New Mexico once reversed from 21 knots to full astern within 90 seconds, far faster than conventional geared turbines.

However, the weight penalty became apparent as turbine technology advanced. Geared turbines in USS North Carolina (1941) were 20% lighter and 5% more efficient than turbo-electric units of similar power. The US Navy abandoned turbo-electric drive for new construction after 1923, though existing units served through WWII.

The system's legacy was proving that electric drive worked. Modern integrated electric propulsion (IEP) systems in Zumwalt-class destroyers and Queen Elizabeth carriers use similar principles with far greater efficiency, vindicating the concept after 80 years of refinement.

## Compatible Ships

- New Mexico-class battleships (US)
- Tennessee-class battleships (US)
- USS Lexington (CV-2)
- USS Saratoga (CV-3)
- Some US heavy cruisers (experimental)
- Fleet oilers (later WWII)

← [[Curtis-Turbine]] (mechanical predecessor)
← [[Parsons-Turbine]] (alternate path)
→ [[Geared-Turbine-Heavy]] (more efficient successor)
→ [Modern IEP] (distant descendant)
