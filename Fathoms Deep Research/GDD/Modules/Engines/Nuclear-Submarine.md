# Nuclear Submarine Reactor

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-015 |
| **Type** | Pressurized Water Reactor (S5W type) |
| **Era** | 1955-2025 |
| **Nation** | United States |
| **Power Output** | 15,000 SHP |

## Description

Compact pressurized water nuclear reactor designed for submarine propulsion. Revolutionary technology providing unlimited underwater endurance limited only by crew endurance and food supplies. The reactor generates heat to produce steam driving turbines connected to the propeller. Nuclear power transformed submarines from submersible torpedo boats into true underwater warships capable of sustained high-speed submerged operations.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 15,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Moderate |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | N/A (unlimited practical endurance) |
| **Reliability** | 98% |
| **Noise Level** | Low |

## Operational Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Submerged Speed | 25+ knots sustained |
| Sprint Speed | 30+ knots (brief periods) |
| Cruise Speed | 20 knots (no battery limits) |
| Silent Speed | 5 knots (ultra-quiet) |
| Patrol Endurance | 90 days (crew/food limited) |
| Core Life | 10-15 years between refuelings |
| Depth Capability | 1,300+ feet |

## Performance Stats

```

Acceleration:     Moderate (2-3 minutes to full power)
Endurance:        Unlimited (practically 90+ days)
Fuel:             Enriched uranium (HEU or LEU)
Range:            Unlimited
Silent Running:   Excellent (pumps and machinery only noise)
Air Independent:  True (unlimited submerged operation)
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Attack submarines (SSN)
- Ballistic missile submarines (SSBN)
- Cruise missile submarines (SSGN)
- Research submarines
- Special operations submarines

## Advantages

- Unlimited underwater endurance (no need to surface/snorkel)
- High sustained submerged speed (20+ knots indefinite)
- True air independence (no battery limitations)
- No exhaust detection (no diesel exhaust)
- Can generate oxygen/fresh water from seawater
- Sprint capability far exceeds diesel-electric
- Strategic mobility (transit oceans submerged)
- Quiet operation at low speeds
- Enables long-range strategic deterrent patrols

## Disadvantages

- Extremely expensive (10x+ cost of conventional)
- Complex operation requires highly trained crew
- Shielding and reactor add significant weight
- Cooling pumps create noise at high power
- Requires specialized shore facilities
- Political/strategic implications (nuclear technology)
- Decommissioning complex and expensive
- Cannot truly "turn off" (reactor always generating heat)
- Reduction gears still create noise

## Historical Notes

USS Nautilus (SSN-571), commissioned 1954, revolutionized submarine warfare. On August 3, 1958, Nautilus completed the first submerged transit under the North Pole - impossible for diesel-electric submarines. The S2W reactor enabled sustained 20+ knot submerged speed, transforming submarines from ambush weapons to hunter-killers.

The S5W reactor became the US Navy's standard attack submarine powerplant through the 1970s. Skipjack-class submarines (1959) combined S5W reactors with streamlined "tear-drop" hulls, achieving 30+ knot submerged speeds - faster than most surface ships. This speed allowed submarines to intercept and trail Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a mission impossible with conventional propulsion.

British submarines adopted nuclear power with HMS Dreadnought (1963), using a US S5W reactor. French submarines developed indigenous PWR1 reactors, while Soviet submarines used their own pressurized water designs. Each nation's reactor designs reflected different priorities - US emphasized quiet operation, Soviets prioritized power and speed.

The true revolution was strategic: ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) could patrol submerged for 70+ days, making them nearly undetectable and providing secure second-strike capability. USS George Washington (1960) began the first SSBN deterrent patrol, fundamentally altering nuclear strategy. By the 1970s, submarines carried the majority of strategic nuclear weapons.

Modern attack submarines like Virginia-class use S9G reactors producing 40,000 SHP, achieving 25+ knots with exceptional quiet operations. Improvements include natural circulation cooling at low speeds (eliminating pump noise), better shielding, and 33-year core life eliminating mid-life refueling. The submarine remains the ultimate application of naval nuclear power.

## Radiation Safety

```
Shielding:        Lead and water shielding
Radiation:        Normal background levels in crew spaces
Exposure:         Strictly monitored, well below limits
Coolant:          Pressurized water (primary loop sealed)
Containment:      Multiple redundant barriers
Safety Record:    Excellent (US Navy zero radiation incidents)
```
