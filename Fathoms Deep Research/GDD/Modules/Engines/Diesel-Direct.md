# Direct-Drive Diesel Engine

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-010 |
| **Type** | Direct-Drive Diesel |
| **Era** | 1910-1960 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 8,000 SHP |

## Description

Large marine diesel engine directly coupled to propeller shaft. Offers excellent fuel efficiency and long range, making it ideal for patrol vessels, auxiliaries, and small combatants where ultimate speed is less important than economy. The mechanical simplicity and fuel efficiency made diesels attractive for merchant conversion and long-range patrol duties.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 8,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Slow |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Excellent |
| **Reliability** | 88% |
| **Noise Level** | Loud |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (12kt) | 0.8 tons/day | 12,000 nm |
| Flank (18kt) | 2.2 tons/day | 7,000 nm |

## Performance Stats

```

```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Patrol vessels
- Corvettes
- Submarine chasers
- Minesweepers
- Auxiliary ships
- Armed merchant cruisers
- Colonial gunboats
- Small escorts

## Advantages

- Outstanding fuel efficiency (best of any engine type)
- Excellent range for extended patrols
- No boilers required (saves crew and weight)
- Diesel fuel less volatile than oil/coal
- Can start quickly (no boiler warm-up)
- Reliable mechanical design
- Lower operating costs than steam
- Suitable for merchant conversions

## Disadvantages

- Limited power output restricts speed
- Heavy vibration affects crew and equipment
- Very loud operation
- Slow acceleration
- Limited power scaling (can't boost)
- Heavy for power output at this era
- Black exhaust smoke visible
- Difficult to repair at sea

## Historical Notes

Marine diesels developed slowly for naval use. German merchant ships pioneered large diesels before WWI, but navies were skeptical. The Royal Navy experimented with diesel gunboats on the Yangtze River, appreciating their range and economy for colonial patrol duties.

HMS Titania (1915), a submarine depot ship, demonstrated diesel reliability with 2,700 SHP engines. The exceptional 8,000nm range made her ideal for supporting submarine flotillas in distant waters. French submarine chasers of WWI used small diesels, achieving 2,000nm range on tiny 400-ton hulls.

German pocket battleships (Deutschland class, 1933) used massive MAN diesels for 54,000 SHP total, achieving 26 knots with exceptional 10,000nm range. This application showed diesel potential, though the engines' weight and vibration were significant compromises. The vibration affected fire control equipment enough that gunnery accuracy suffered.

During WWII, diesels powered most auxiliary vessels, patrol craft, and small escorts. British Flower-class corvettes initially used triple-expansion steam, but later units switched to diesel for better endurance. American PC-class submarine chasers used paired diesels for 16-knot speed with 8,000nm range, ideal for convoy escort work.

Post-WWII, diesel technology improved dramatically. Lighter, more powerful engines became available, and by the 1960s, diesel propulsion was standard for frigates, patrol boats, and auxiliaries. The efficiency advantage only increased as fuel costs rose.

## Compatible Ships

- Patrol vessels (all sizes)
- Corvettes (WWII)
