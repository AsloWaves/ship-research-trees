# Geared Turbine (Heavy)

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-008 |
| **Type** | Geared Steam Turbine (Heavy) |
| **Era** | 1930-1960 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 150,000 SHP |

## Description

Massive geared turbine installation for battleships and aircraft carriers. Represents the ultimate development of steam turbine technology, combining enormous power output with good efficiency through sophisticated reduction gearing. These powerplants enabled the fast battleships and fleet carriers that dominated WWII naval operations.

## Performance Characteristics

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (15kt) | 12.0 tons/day | 15,000 nm |
| Flank (33kt) | 95.0 tons/day | 4,500 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     150,000 SHP (per turbine set, 4 per ship typical)
Max Ship Speed:   ~33 knots (fast battleship hulls)
Acceleration:     Moderate (4 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.32 kg oil per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     2.5x (excellent for heavy unit)
Vibration:        Minimal (smooth operation)
Weight/Power:     3.9 kg per SHP (excellent for size)
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- Fast battleships
- Fleet aircraft carriers
- Battle cruisers (late)
- Large cruisers (Alaska-class)
- Aviation support ships (large)

## Advantages

- Enormous power enables 30+ knot capital ships
- Excellent fuel efficiency even at high power
- Smooth operation critical for stable gun/flight platforms
- Reliable design proven in extended operations
- Good power across entire speed range
- Enables long-range carrier task force operations
- Compact relative to power output

## Disadvantages

- Massive installation requires huge machinery spaces
- Extremely expensive (major capital investment)
- Complex maintenance requires large engineering crew
- Vulnerable to underwater damage (torpedo/mine)
- No reverse without separate astern turbines
- Long acceleration time hampers emergency maneuvers
- Heavy fuel consumption at high speed

## Historical Notes

Heavy geared turbines enabled the fast battleship era. USS Iowa (1943) mounted four General Electric geared turbines producing 212,000 SHP total, driving the 45,000-ton battleship to 33 knots. This speed allowed Iowa-class ships to escort carrier task forces, fundamentally changing battleship employment doctrine.

Japanese Yamato (1941) used four Kampon geared turbines generating 150,000 SHP, achieving 27 knots despite 65,000-ton displacement. British King George V class (1940) used Parsons geared turbines for 110,000 SHP and 28 knots. German Bismarck (1940) employed Brown-Boveri geared turbines producing 138,000 SHP for 30.8 knots.

Essex-class carriers (1942-1945) demonstrated the design's versatility, using four Westinghouse geared turbines for 150,000 SHP. This power enabled 33-knot speed crucial for aircraft launch operations and tactical flexibility. The turbines' reliability during Pacific War operations, often running continuously for weeks, proved their maturity.

The efficiency advantage over earlier direct-drive turbines was dramatic. A 1943 comparison showed geared turbines consumed 30% less fuel at cruising speed and 20% less at high speed compared to direct-drive units of similar power. This extended operational radius and reduced logistical burden significantly.

Post-WWII, heavy geared turbines powered supercarriers like USS Forrestal (1955) with 260,000 SHP, and the last conventional carriers before nuclear power. The design reached its apex in USS Kitty Hawk (1961) with four Westinghouse turbines producing 280,000 SHP, achieving 34 knots on 80,000 tons displacement.

## Compatible Ships

- Iowa-class battleships (US)
- South Dakota-class battleships (US)
- North Carolina-class battleships (US)
- King George V-class battleships (UK)
- Yamato-class battleships (Japan)
- Essex-class carriers (US)
- Midway-class carriers (US)
- Illustrious-class carriers (UK)
- Alaska-class large cruisers (US)

## Upgrade Path

← [[Parsons-Turbine]] (earlier direct-drive)
← [[Turbo-Electric]] (alternate US design)
→ [[Nuclear-Carrier]] (revolutionary replacement)
