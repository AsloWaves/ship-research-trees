# Curtis Impulse Turbine

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-006 |
| **Type** | Steam Turbine (Impulse) |
| **Era** | 1910-1930 |
| **Nation** | United States |
| **Power Output** | 28,000 SHP |

## Description

American-developed impulse turbine using velocity staging rather than pure reaction design. Invented by Charles Curtis, this design uses fewer stages than Parsons turbines while achieving similar power output. The US Navy standardized on Curtis turbines for early dreadnoughts and cruisers, creating an indigenous turbine industry independent of British patents.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power** | 28,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Moderate |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Good |
| **Reliability** | 85% |
| **Noise Level** | Low |

## Fuel Consumption

| Speed | Consumption | Range (est) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruising (12kt) | 3.2 tons/day | 5,800 nm |
| Flank (21kt) | 13.0 tons/day | 2,000 nm |

## Performance Stats

```
Power Output:     28,000 SHP (per turbine set)
Max Ship Speed:   ~21 knots (battleship hulls)
Acceleration:     Moderate (3 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.48 kg oil per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.6x (slightly better than Parsons)
Efficiency Curve:  Better at partial power than Parsons
```

## Suitable Ship Types

- US Navy dreadnoughts (pre-1920)
- American heavy cruisers (early)
- Standard-type battleships
- Omaha-class light cruisers
- Fleet destroyers (US)

## Advantages

- More efficient at partial power than reaction turbines
- Fewer stages simplify construction
- Better cruising efficiency than direct-drive Parsons
- Proven reliability in US service
- Easier to manufacture domestically
- Good performance across speed range
- Slightly lighter than equivalent Parsons design

## Disadvantages

- Still requires separate astern turbine
- Direct drive limits propeller efficiency
- More complex than simple reaction design
- Higher maintenance than later geared turbines
- US-specific design limits international parts
- Not optimal at maximum power
- Requires oil-fired boilers for best performance

## Historical Notes

Charles Curtis developed his impulse turbine design in the early 1900s, licensed to General Electric for manufacture. The US Navy adopted Curtis turbines for USS Delaware (1910) and subsequent dreadnoughts through the Wyoming class (1912). This decision created an American turbine industry and avoided British patent restrictions on Parsons designs.

The Curtis design used velocity staging, where steam jets impinge on moving blades through multiple velocity reduction stages. This required fewer overall stages than Parsons' reaction turbines, simplifying manufacture and maintenance. The trade-off was slightly lower efficiency at maximum power, but better partial-load performance.

USS Texas (1914) and USS New York (1914) used Curtis turbines producing 28,100 SHP, achieving 21 knots. The turbines proved reliable during WWI service, with USS Texas operating with the British Grand Fleet. American destroyer flotillas also used Curtis turbines, appreciating their reliability and cruising efficiency.

By the 1920s, the US Navy transitioned to geared turbines which solved the cruising efficiency problem. However, Curtis turbines remained in service through WWII in older battleships and cruisers. The design's legacy was establishing American turbine manufacturing capability independent of foreign patents, crucial for US naval expansion.

## Compatible Ships

- US Navy dreadnoughts (1910-1920)
- Standard-type battleships (1913-1920)
- Omaha-class light cruisers
- Wickes/Clemson-class destroyers
- US heavy cruisers (early 1920s)

→ [[Geared-Turbine]] (improved efficiency)
→ [[Turbo-Electric]] (US specialty development)
