# COGAG Propulsion

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-014 |
| **Type** | Combined Gas and Gas |
| **Era** | 1970-2025 |
| **Nation** | Universal |
| **Power Output** | 75,000 SHP |

## Description

Combined Gas and Gas (COGAG) propulsion using two sets of gas turbines - cruise turbines for efficient operation and boost turbines for maximum speed. Both can operate simultaneously for highest power output. This configuration offers excellent performance and rapid acceleration, making it ideal for destroyers and cruisers requiring high sustained speeds. The all-gas-turbine design simplifies logistics compared to mixed diesel/gas systems.

## Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Rating |
|----------------|--------|
| **Power (Cruise)** | 20,000 SHP |
| **Power (Boost)** | 55,000 SHP |
| **Power (Combined)** | 75,000 SHP |
| **Acceleration** | Very Fast |
| **Fuel Efficiency** | Good |
| **Reliability** | 86% |
| **Noise Level** | Moderate |

## Fuel Consumption

| Mode | Consumption | Range (est) |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Cruise (18kt) | 3.5 tons/day | 6,000 nm |
| Combined (28kt) | 12.0 tons/day | 3,000 nm |

## Suitable Ship Types

- Modern destroyers
- Guided missile cruisers
- Large frigates
- Fast replenishment ships
- Amphibious assault ships
- Aviation cruisers

## Advantages

- Exceptional power-to-weight ratio
- Very rapid acceleration (seconds to full power)
- High sustained top speed capability
- Simplified logistics (single fuel type)
- Compact installation saves space/weight
- Very low crew requirements (automated)

- Easy to maintain (modular design)
- Quick engine changes (swap out modules)
- Excellent for high-speed task force operations

## Disadvantages

- Higher cruise fuel consumption than diesel systems
- Expensive fuel (compared to diesel)
- Gas turbines require filtered air intake
- Very hot exhaust (high IR signature)
- Salt corrosion issues in marine environment
- Reduced range compared to CODAG
- Foreign object damage vulnerability
- Less fuel efficient than steam at sustained high speed
- Expensive initial cost

## Historical Notes

COGAG emerged as navies prioritized speed and rapid response over endurance. The US Navy's Spruance-class destroyers (1975) pioneered the configuration with 4x GE LM2500 gas turbines producing 80,000 SHP, achieving 33 knots on 8,040 tons. The all-gas-turbine plant required only 35 engineering crew versus 100+ for steam plants of similar power.

British Type 42 destroyers (1978) used COGAG with Rolls-Royce Olympus and Tyne turbines for 54,000 SHP combined. During the Falklands War (1982), the rapid acceleration proved valuable - destroyers could sprint to intercept incoming aircraft, then quickly slow to launch helicopters. The flexibility exceeded steam plant capabilities.

The Ticonderoga-class cruisers (1983) demonstrated COGAG effectiveness with 4x LM2500 turbines producing 80,000 SHP on 9,800-ton hulls. The 30+ knot sustained speed allowed these cruisers to screen carrier battle groups effectively. The ability to operate one or two turbines for patrol, then rapidly accelerate to full power, provided tactical flexibility.

Modern destroyers universally adopted COGAG or similar configurations. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers use 4x LM2500 turbines for 100,000 SHP, achieving 30+ knots. Japanese Kongo-class and Spanish F-100 class use similar systems. The lightweight, compact installation allows more space for weapons and sensors compared to steam plants.

The main trade-off versus CODAG is cruise efficiency. Operating gas turbines at low power is less efficient than diesel engines, reducing patrol endurance by 30-40%. However, for area air defense destroyers operating with carrier groups, the emphasis is on speed and acceleration rather than independent long-range operations, making COGAG ideal.

Future developments include more efficient cruise turbines and intercooled recuperated (ICR) designs promising 50% better fuel efficiency. The basic COGAG concept will likely continue as the destroyer standard for decades.
