# Quadruple Expansion Steam Engine

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-010 |
| **Era** | 1890-1920 |
| **Power Output** | 5,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 45% |
| **Weight** | 180 tons |
| **Fuel Type** | Coal/Oil |

## Description

The quadruple expansion engine represents the pinnacle of reciprocating steam engine development. By expanding steam through four successive cylinders at progressively lower pressures, it achieves marginally better efficiency than triple expansion designs. This extra stage requires higher steam pressures and more complex machinery, but delivers approximately 65% more power than triple expansion engines of similar size.

The four cylinders - high, intermediate-high, intermediate-low, and low pressure - extract every possible bit of energy from the steam. While more complex and expensive than triple expansion engines, quadruple expansion designs found favor in capital ships where maximum power from reciprocating machinery was needed before the turbine revolution.

## Performance Stats
```
Power Output:     5,000 SHP (per unit)
Acceleration:     Slow (5 minutes to full power)
Fuel Consumption: 0.72 kg per SHP-hour
Range Factor:     1.15x
Operating Pressure: 250-300 PSI (higher than triple)
```

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | Medium-Low | Best of reciprocating designs |
| Efficiency | Poor-Moderate | Marginal improvement over triple |
| Weight | Heavy | Large, complex machinery |
| Reliability | Good | More complex but proven |
| Noise | Moderate | Four-cylinder beat |
| Maintenance | Moderate-High | More cylinders, more maintenance |

## Advantages
- Highest power of reciprocating engines
- Fully reversible for maneuvering
- Slightly better efficiency than triple expansion
- Can burn coal or oil fuel
- Proven technology for large ships

## Disadvantages
- Still inferior to turbines in power/weight
- Complex four-cylinder arrangement
- Higher steam pressure requirements
- Expensive to manufacture
- Vibration issues at high power
- Obsolete by 1910 for major warships

## Historical Notes

Quadruple expansion engines represented the last gasp of reciprocating engine technology before turbines swept them aside. They were primarily used in large pre-dreadnoughts and early dreadnoughts during the 1895-1910 transition period. Some ships like HMS King Edward VII class (1903) used quadruple expansion engines generating 18,000 SHP - impressive for reciprocating machinery.

However, the arrival of Parsons turbines in HMS Dreadnought (1906) made them instantly obsolete for high-performance warships. By 1910, no major naval power was installing quadruple expansion engines in capital ships. They lingered in merchant service and smaller warships where their reliability and reversibility mattered more than peak power.

## Compatible Ships
