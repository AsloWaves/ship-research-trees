# Curtis Steam Turbine

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module ID** | ENG-012 |
| **Era** | 1910-1935 |
| **Power Output** | 22,000 SHP |
| **Efficiency** | 62% |
| **Weight** | 220 tons |

## Description

The Curtis turbine represents an American alternative to British Parsons designs, using velocity-compounded stages instead of pressure-compounded stages. In a Curtis turbine, steam passes through a single nozzle at high velocity, then through multiple rotating and stationary blade rows that extract energy through velocity changes rather than pressure drops. This approach requires fewer stages than Parsons turbines, resulting in more compact machinery.

The US Navy adopted Curtis turbines for many capital ships in the 1910-1920 period, valuing their compactness and simpler construction. While not quite as efficient as contemporary Parsons designs, Curtis turbines were easier to manufacture and maintain, and proved highly reliable in service. They represented a distinctly American engineering philosophy prioritizing practicality over theoretical perfection.

## Performance Stats
```
Power Output:     22,000 SHP (per unit)
Acceleration:     Moderate (3.5 minutes to full power)

## Characteristics
| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Power | High | Competitive with Parsons |
| Efficiency | Moderate-Good | Slightly behind Parsons |
| Weight | Medium | More compact design |
| Reliability | Good | Simpler construction |
| Noise | Low | Smooth turbine operation |
| Maintenance | Moderate-Low | Fewer stages to service |

## Advantages
- Compact machinery spaces
- Simpler construction than Parsons
- Fewer turbine stages (easier maintenance)
- Reliable and proven in US service
- Good power-to-weight ratio
- Excellent for high-speed operations

## Disadvantages
- Slightly less efficient than Parsons turbines
- Still has direct-drive limitations (pre-gearing)
- Not reversible (separate astern turbine)
- Primarily US manufacture (supply issues for others)
- Velocity staging less forgiving of steam quality

## Historical Notes

The US Navy installed Curtis turbines in many pre-WWI and WWI-era capital ships, including the Pennsylvania, Nevada, and New Mexico class battleships. The compact design was particularly valued in US ships, where internal layout emphasized armor protection over machinery space. Curtis turbines powered the "Standard Type" battleships that formed the backbone of the US fleet in WWI.

The rivalry between Curtis and Parsons designs reflected broader Anglo-American engineering philosophies. British designs optimized for maximum efficiency, accepting complexity. American designs prioritized manufacturability and maintainability. In practice, both approaches worked well, and the US Navy successfully operated Curtis turbines through the 1930s before transitioning to geared turbines.

## Famous Examples
- USS Pennsylvania (1916): 31,500 SHP, 21 knots
- USS Nevada (1916): 26,500 SHP, 20.5 knots
- USS New Mexico (1918): 32,000 SHP, 21 knots

## Compatible Ships
- US battleships (1910-1920)
- US armored cruisers
- Large destroyers
- High-speed transports
