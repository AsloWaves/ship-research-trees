# Permadeath System

## Overview
The permadeath system is the core risk/reward mechanism in Fathoms Deep, creating meaningful stakes for player decisions through permanent loss of ships, crew, and modules. This document defines the tier-based risk scaling, permadeath mechanics, insurance systems, and design philosophy behind high-stakes progression.

## Implementation Status
**Status**: 📋 PLANNED - Core progression risk system
**Phase**: Vision/Foundation
**Priority**: HIGH - Defines stakes for entire game

---

## Core Philosophy

### Why Permadeath Exists

**Design Principle**: Meaningful loss creates meaningful victory.

**Psychological Foundation:**
Without real stakes, victories feel hollow. The anxiety of potential loss creates emotional investment. The relief of successful survival generates satisfaction. The drama of close calls creates memorable stories.

**Gameplay Benefits:**
1. **Tension Generation**: Every expedition carries real stakes
2. **Risk Management**: Constant decision-making about acceptable danger
3. **Skill Expression**: Mastery reduces loss frequency
4. **Economic Cycling**: Ships and modules continuously destroyed/created
5. **Achievement Value**: High-tier accomplishments genuinely impressive
6. **Story Creation**: Losses and near-misses generate player narratives

**What We Avoid:**
- Arbitrary loss that feels unfair
- Punishment without learning opportunity
- Gatekeeping that blocks player progression
- Frustration that drives players away
- Pay-to-avoid-loss mechanics

---

## The Tier-Based Risk Ladder

### Overview: Graduated Stakes
The permadeath system uses **10 ship tiers** with escalating risk profiles. Players opt into appropriate challenge levels based on skill, experience, and risk tolerance.

**Design Philosophy**: Lower tiers teach mechanics in forgiving environment. Middle tiers introduce real stakes. Upper tiers demand mastery with maximum consequences.

---

### Tiers 1-4: Protected Learning Zone

#### Risk Profile
- **Ship Recovery**: 100% guaranteed (always towed to friendly port if destroyed)
- **Crew Safety**: No permanent casualties (always evacuate successfully)
- **Module Damage**: Escalating destruction chance (10-30% per module)
- **Cargo/Loot**: Always at risk if ship destroyed
- **Time Investment**: Lost on failed expeditions

#### Purpose
**Educational environment where failure teaches without devastating consequences.**

**Player Experience:**
- Learn combat mechanics without ship loss anxiety
- Experiment with tactics and builds freely
- Understand extraction mechanics in practice
- Build confidence before entering permadeath tiers
- Progress steadily toward intermediate tiers

**Module Damage Escalation:**
- **Tier 1**: 10% chance per module (minimal risk)
- **Tier 2**: 15% chance per module (starting to matter)
- **Tier 3**: 20% chance per module (economic consequence)
- **Tier 4**: 30% chance per module (significant but not catastrophic)

**Design Rationale:**
New players need space to learn. Even experienced players benefit from low-stakes practice. Module damage introduces concept of permanent loss without devastating impact.

**Economic Impact:**
Module replacement costs create minor economic pressure. Players learn to value equipment without losing irreplaceable assets (ships, veteran crew).

---

### Tier 5: The Critical Threshold

#### Risk Profile
- **Ship Recovery**: 100% guaranteed (LAST fully safe tier)
- **Crew Casualties**: 30% chance of permanent crew deaths
- **Module Damage**: 40% destruction chance per module
- **Cargo/Loot**: Always at risk
- **Psychological**: First real stakes, decision point for risk-averse players

#### Purpose
**Introduction to real consequences and transition point to permadeath gameplay.**

**Player Experience:**
- First exposure to crew permadeath
- Emotional investment in named crew members at risk
- Strategic decision: Continue to higher tiers or stay in comfort zone?
- Last tier where ship itself is safe
- Significant but not catastrophic losses possible

**Crew Casualty Mechanics:**
When ship destroyed in Tier 5:
- Roll for each crew member individually: 30% death chance
- Average 3-5 crew lost from typical 10-person crew
- Veteran crew (with skills) disproportionately painful to lose
- Specialized crew (rare skills) create harder decisions about risk

**Why 30% Casualty Rate:**
- High enough to create real anxiety
- Low enough that total crew wipeout is unlikely
- Forces players to value and develop crew
- Introduces risk management thinking

**Design Rationale:**
Tier 5 is the "sorting tier" where players discover their risk tolerance. Some will stay here indefinitely (valid strategy). Others will embrace higher-tier challenges. Both playstyles are legitimate.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Build veteran crews in safe tiers before risking them
- Rotate crew assignments (don't risk best crew every expedition)
- Balance crew development against potential loss
- Understand that Tier 6+ eliminates ship safety net

---

### Tiers 6-9: Permadeath Escalation

#### Risk Profile (Graduated by Tier)

**Tier 6: Introduction to Ship Permadeath**
- **Ship Loss**: 30% permanent destruction chance
- **Crew Casualties**: 40% death chance per crew member
- **Module Destruction**: 50% loss chance
- **Purpose**: First tier where ship itself at risk

**Tier 7: Moderate Permadeath Stakes**
- **Ship Loss**: 40% permanent destruction chance
- **Crew Casualties**: 50% death chance per crew member
- **Module Destruction**: 60% loss chance
- **Purpose**: Significant but manageable risk

**Tier 8: High-Stakes Operations**
- **Ship Loss**: 60% permanent destruction chance
- **Crew Casualties**: 60% death chance per crew member
- **Module Destruction**: 70% loss chance
- **Purpose**: Serious commitment required

**Tier 9: Extreme Risk**
- **Ship Loss**: 80% permanent destruction chance
- **Crew Casualties**: 70% death chance per crew member
- **Module Destruction**: 80% loss chance
- **Purpose**: Only for experienced players accepting major risk

#### Player Experience
**Tiers 6-7**: "This ship could die, but I have reasonable survival chance"
- Manageable anxiety
- Insurance viable
- Losses sting but recoverable
- Learn permadeath management in graduated way

**Tiers 8-9**: "I'm probably losing this ship if destroyed"
- High anxiety during expeditions
- Insurance expensive but valuable
- Losses devastating but expected
- Only take out when prepared for consequences

#### Design Philosophy: The Risk Ladder
Each tier increases stakes incrementally. Players naturally progress through tiers, building experience with permadeath mechanics before facing maximum consequences.

**Economic Pressure:**
High permadeath rates create constant demand for replacement ships. Player economy revolves around:
- Building/buying replacement ships
- Developing new crews
- Acquiring modules again
- Insurance markets

**Strategic Depth:**
- **Ship Selection**: Use expendable ships for risky missions
- **Crew Management**: Rotate crews to avoid losing all veterans
- **Insurance Decisions**: When to pay for coverage
- **Mission Selection**: Only accept risks commensurate with potential reward
- **Extraction Priorities**: Ship/crew survival vs. cargo value

---

### Tier 10: Ultimate Risk

#### Risk Profile
- **Ship Loss**: 100% GUARANTEED permanent destruction if destroyed
- **Crew Casualties**: 100% GUARANTEED all crew killed if ship destroyed
- **Module Destruction**: 100% all modules lost permanently
- **Cargo/Loot**: Always at risk
- **No Recovery**: ABSOLUTE PERMADEATH

#### Purpose
**Maximum stakes for legendary accomplishments and bragging rights.**

**Player Experience:**
- Extreme anxiety and excitement
- Every decision critical
- Victories legendary
- Losses devastating but expected
- Status symbol (owning/operating Tier 10s demonstrates skill)

**Design Philosophy: The Pinnacle**
Tier 10 is not meant for regular play. It's the apex challenge for:
- Special occasions and major operations
- Experienced players seeking maximum thrill
- Demonstrating elite skill and confidence
- Creating legendary player stories

**Risk vs. Reward:**
Tier 10 expeditions must offer commensurate rewards:
- **Loot Quality**: Best modules, rarest resources, highest economic value
- **Reputation Gains**: Massive reputation boosts for successes
- **Achievement Recognition**: Special titles, cosmetics, server-wide announcements
- **Historical Significance**: Famous ships (Yamato, Bismarck, Iowa) at Tier 10

**When to Use Tier 10:**
- Major server events or campaigns
- High-value convoy escorts
- Territorial conquest operations
- Revenge missions against hated enemies
- Final expedition before quitting game (YOLO mindset)

**Insurance Considerations:**
Even expensive insurance only reduces risk to 70-80%. No complete safety net exists. Players must accept potential for total loss.

## Insurance System

### Overview
Insurance is an economic risk mitigation tool that reduces (but never eliminates) permadeath chances.

### Mechanics

#### How It Works
1. **Purchase Before Expedition**: Must buy coverage before departure
2. **Single-Use Coverage**: Valid for one expedition only
3. **Graduated Costs**: Higher tiers = more expensive insurance
4. **Risk Reduction**: Lowers permadeath percentages by 20-30%
5. **No Guaranteed Safety**: Even insured ships can permanently die

#### Insurance Costs (Concept)

**Tier 5 Insurance:**
- **Cost**: 5,000 credits
- **Effect**: Reduces crew casualty chance from 30% to 20%
- **Use Case**: Low-cost protection for first permadeath tier

**Tier 6-7 Insurance:**
- **Cost**: 30,000-50,000 credits
- **Effect**: Reduces ship loss from 30-40% to 10-20%
- **Use Case**: Moderate protection for early permadeath tiers

**Tier 8-9 Insurance:**
- **Cost**: 150,000-300,000 credits
- **Effect**: Reduces ship loss from 60-80% to 40-50%
- **Use Case**: Major protection for high-value ships, still significant risk

**Tier 10 Insurance:**
- **Cost**: 1,000,000+ credits
- **Effect**: Reduces ship loss from 100% to 70%
- **Use Case**: Extremely expensive, only for critical missions

#### Strategic Insurance Decisions

**When Insurance Makes Sense:**
- High-value cargo expeditions (potential profit exceeds insurance cost)
- Veteran crew at risk (replacement cost exceeds insurance)
- Rare/valuable ships (emotional or economic investment high)
- Low confidence in extraction success (anticipating danger)

**When to Skip Insurance:**
- Low-risk expeditions near friendly waters
- Expendable ships/crews
- Economic expeditions (loot value low)
- High confidence in survival

**Insurance as Economic Gameplay:**
Players must calculate:
- Expected value of loot vs. insurance cost
- Ship replacement cost vs. insurance cost
- Confidence in mission success
- Risk tolerance and bankroll size

### Insurance Market Dynamics

**Player-Provided Insurance (Advanced Feature):**
- Players can offer insurance contracts to others
- Risk underwriting becomes economic gameplay
- Insurance premiums fluctuate based on market conditions
- Creates insurance corporations and financial gameplay

**NPC Insurance Baseline:**
- Fixed-rate insurance always available
- Player insurance competes on price/terms
- Prevents market manipulation

## Permadeath Resolution

### When Ship Is Destroyed

#### Step 1: Crew Evacuation Check
- Crew attempts to evacuate sinking ship
- Success rate based on:
  - Ship tier (higher tier = more dangerous, lower evacuation success)
  - Damage type (catastrophic explosion vs. gradual sinking)
  - Crew skills (some specializations improve evacuation)
- Failed evacuation = crew remains on ship for permadeath roll

#### Step 2: Permadeath Rolls

**Ship Permadeath Roll:**
1. Check insurance status (reduces risk percentage)
2. Roll 1d100 against tier-specific threshold
3. **Success**: Ship recovered and towed to friendly port (damaged but repairable)
4. **Failure**: Ship permanently destroyed, removed from inventory

**Crew Casualty Rolls (for each crew member):**
1. Check insurance and evacuation success
2. Roll 1d100 per crew member against tier-specific threshold
3. **Success**: Crew survives, rescued by friendly forces
4. **Failure**: Crew killed in action, permanently removed

**Module Destruction Rolls (for each module):**
1. Roll 1d100 per module against tier-specific threshold
2. **Success**: Module salvageable, recovered with ship (if ship survives)
3. **Failure**: Module destroyed, must be replaced

#### Step 3: Asset Recovery

**If Ship Survives Permadeath:**
- Ship towed to nearest friendly port automatically
- Major repair costs (50-80% of ship value)
- Surviving modules intact but need repair
- Surviving crew traumatized (temporary skill penalties)

**If Ship Lost to Permadeath:**
- Ship removed from player inventory permanently
- All modules destroyed (even if they rolled survival)
- Dead crew removed from roster
- Insurance payout if covered (partial ship value)

#### Step 4: Cargo and Loot
**Always Lost When Ship Destroyed:**
- All cargo containers destroyed
- Loot acquired during expedition lost
- No recovery possible (creates loot sinks)

## Crew Permadeath Mechanics

### Why Crew Permadeath Matters

**Emotional Investment:**
Named crew members with developed skills create attachment. Losing veteran crew hurts emotionally, not just economically.

**Strategic Depth:**
- Rotate crews to avoid losing all veterans simultaneously
- Develop backup crews as insurance
- Balance crew risk against mission requirements

**Progression Impact:**
Crew skill development takes time. Losing veteran crew sets back progression significantly.

### Crew Development Timeline

**Rookie Crew (0-10 missions):**
- Basic skills, minimal specialization
- Low economic value
- Losing them hurts little (easily replaced)

**Trained Crew (10-50 missions):**
- Moderate skills, starting specialization
- Moderate economic value
- Losing them hurts (time investment lost)

**Veteran Crew (50-200 missions):**
- Advanced skills, deep specialization
- High economic value
- Losing them is devastating (months of development)

**Legendary Crew (200+ missions):**
- Maximum skills, unique capabilities
- Irreplaceable value
- Losing them is catastrophic (should rarely risk)

### Crew Casualty Impact

**Immediate Effects:**
- Reduced combat effectiveness
- Lost specialized skills
- Morale penalties for surviving crew
- Must recruit/train replacements

**Long-Term Consequences:**
- Months of progression lost
- Ship effectiveness reduced until crew rebuilt
- Economic costs for recruitment and training
- Psychological impact on player

## Permadeath Psychology

### The Emotional Cycle

**Before Expedition:**
- Excitement about potential rewards
- Anxiety about permadeath risk
- Strategic planning to minimize danger
- Investment in preparation (insurance, supplies)

**During Expedition:**
- Building tension as stakes accumulate
- Hyperawareness of damage and threats
- Decision paralysis vs. bold action
- Risk/reward calculations constantly updating

**After Successful Extraction:**
- Euphoria and relief
- Sense of accomplishment
- Desire to repeat (dopamine hit)
- Pride in skill expression

**After Permadeath Loss:**
- Shock and disbelief (denial phase)
- Anger at self or circumstances
- Grief over lost assets
- **Critical**: Resolve to improve and return (not quit)

### Designing for Healthy Permadeath

**Make Loss Hurt (But Not Break):**
- Painful enough to matter
- Not so devastating players quit
- Clear path to recovery
- Learning opportunity, not pure punishment

**Prevent Rage Quitting:**
- Graduated tiers mean players opt into risk
- Clear feedback on what went wrong
- Salvage systems recover some value
- Community support for major losses
- Lower tiers always available for rebuilding

**Celebrate Survival:**
- Recognition for high-tier expedition successes
- Statistics tracking survival rates
- Community sharing of near-miss stories
- Rewards for consistency (consecutive successful extractions)

---

## Risk Management Strategies

### Ship Fleet Management

**Diversified Portfolio:**
- Maintain multiple ships per tier
- Some "expendable" ships for risky missions
- "Prestige" ships only used when confident
- Backup ships in reserve

**Economic Hedging:**
- Never risk more than 20% of total wealth in single expedition
- Keep liquid credits for ship replacement
- Diversify assets (ships, modules, resources)

### Crew Management

**Rotation Systems:**
- Primary crew for important missions
- Secondary crew for routine expeditions
- Training crews for skill development
- Reserve crews as insurance

**Specialization Balance:**
- Don't over-specialize critical crews
- Develop multiple crews with similar skills
- Cross-train for redundancy

### Mission Selection

**Risk Assessment:**
- Only enter tiers appropriate for skill level
- Avoid high-tier expeditions when tilted
- Choose objectives matching risk tolerance
- Consider insurance for borderline decisions

### Extraction Tactics

**Survival Priority:**
- Ship/crew survival over cargo value
- Jettison loot if necessary for speed
- Emergency repairs even if expensive
- Call for squadron help when desperate

---

## Economic Impact of Permadeath

### Loot Sinks
Permadeath destroys ships, modules, cargo, creating constant demand:
- **Shipbuilding industry**: Players craft replacement ships
- **Module markets**: Destroyed modules need replacement
- **Resource demand**: Materials for repairs and construction
- **Insurance sector**: Risk mitigation services

### Economic Cycling
Without permadeath, economy stagnates (everyone eventually has everything). Permadeath ensures:
- Constant turnover of high-tier ships
- Veteran players still need new equipment
- Resource gathering remains valuable
- Market prices stay dynamic

### Wealth Reset Mechanism
Permadeath prevents runaway wealth accumulation:
- Even wealthy players lose assets
- Skill matters more than bankroll
- New players can catch up
- Server economy stays balanced

---

## Permadeath and Player Retention

### The Paradox
**Permadeath drives away some players but creates intense loyalty in others.**

### Retention Strategies

**For Risk-Averse Players:**
- Tiers 1-5 provide safe progression
- No requirement to enter permadeath tiers
- Valid playstyle: stay in safe zones indefinitely
- Economic gameplay doesn't require high-tier ships

**For Thrill-Seekers:**
- Tiers 6-10 provide escalating challenges
- Insurance options calibrate risk
- High-tier accomplishments earn recognition
- Community celebrates survival stories

**For Mainstream Players:**
- Graduated risk lets players find comfort zone
- Insurance provides safety net
- Squadron support reduces solo risk
- Clear feedback improves skill over time

### When Players Quit

**Acceptable Churn:**
- Players who hate permadeath (not target audience)
- Players seeking casual experience (wrong game)
- Players unwilling to accept loss (design mismatch)

**Problematic Churn (Must Prevent):**
- Frustration from unfair mechanics
- Confusion about permadeath rules
- Catastrophic loss without understanding risk
- Technical issues causing undeserved losses

**Prevention:**
- Crystal-clear permadeath communication
- Tutorial extensively covers risk system
- Failsafes against bugs causing wrongful loss
- Support for players experiencing unfair losses

---

## Permadeath Alternatives Considered

### Why NOT Full Permadeath (Everything Always Lost)
- Too punishing for mainstream audience
- Prevents new players from learning
- Creates excessive anxiety
- Reduces build experimentation
- Discourages taking calculated risks

### Why NOT Zero Permadeath (Nothing Ever Lost)
- No stakes or tension
- Victories feel hollow
- No economic cycling
- No achievement value
- Boring long-term

### Why Graduated Permadeath (Our System)
- **Best of both worlds**: Safe learning, challenging endgame
- **Player agency**: Choose risk level
- **Economic health**: Cycling without devastation
- **Emotional engagement**: Stakes where they matter
- **Skill expression**: Mastery reduces but doesn't eliminate risk

## Known Issues & Design Challenges

### Challenge 1: The "One More Try" Spiral
**Problem**: Players lose ship, immediately risk next ship seeking revenge, spiral into bankruptcy

**Mitigation:**
- Cooldown period after permadeath before returning to same tier
- Warning systems when risking last ship
- Forced lower-tier rebuilding period
- Tutorial about risk management and bankroll

### Challenge 2: Technical Deaths Feel Unfair
**Problem**: Bugs, server issues, or lag causing undeserved permadeath

**Solution:**
- Comprehensive logging of all permadeath events
- Customer support review of technical issues
- Restore policy for proven bugs/server problems
- High-quality technical infrastructure to minimize issues

### Challenge 3: Risk-Averse Players Never Progress
**Problem**: Some players stay in safe tiers forever, miss high-tier content

**Balance:**
- This is acceptable! Safe tiers are valid playstyle
- Economic incentives encourage higher-tier participation
- Social pressure from squadrons
- Exclusive high-tier content as carrot (not stick)

### Challenge 4: Insurance Abuse
**Problem**: Players gaming insurance system or market manipulation

**Prevention:**
- Single-use per-expedition insurance (can't stockpile)
- Cooldown prevents rapid insurance cycling
- NPC baseline insurance prevents monopolies
- Anti-fraud detection systems

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Permadeath statistics tracking**: Leaderboards for survival rates
- **Memorial systems**: Commemorate lost legendary ships/crew
- **Salvage mechanics**: Recover some value from permadeath losses
- **Resurrection options**: Rare, expensive crew revival (limited use)
- **Legacy systems**: Crew descendants inherit some parent skills

### Potential Additions
- **Hardcore mode**: Higher permadeath rates for masochistic players
- **Seasonal resets**: Temporary servers with accelerated progression/permadeath
- **Permadeath insurance markets**: Player-run insurance corporations
- **Ship legacy**: Destroyed ships leave wreckage salvageable by others
