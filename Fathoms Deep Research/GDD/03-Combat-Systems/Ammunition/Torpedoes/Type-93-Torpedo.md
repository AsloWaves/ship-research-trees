## Historical Background

The Type 93 torpedo, known to the Allies as the "Long Lance," was the most advanced torpedo of World War II. Its revolutionary oxygen propulsion system (using pure compressed oxygen instead of air) gave it unmatched range and left almost no wake - making it extremely difficult to detect and avoid.

The weapon was a closely guarded secret. Allied intelligence initially refused to believe that Japanese torpedoes could achieve such range and performance. The devastating losses at the Battle of Savo Island and other night actions were partially attributed to underestimating this weapon.

At 24 inches (610mm) diameter, it was significantly larger than contemporary Allied torpedoes (typically 21"/533mm), contributing to its exceptional range and warhead size.

## Balance Notes

> *Designer notes for game balance*

- **Role**: Long-range ambush weapon, devastating alpha strike
- **Strengths**: Range, damage, stealth, reload capability
- **Weaknesses**: Slow arming, large turn radius, limited launches
- **Historical Accuracy**: Very high - signature Japanese weapon
- **Comparable Weapons**: No direct equivalent (historically unique)

### Tactical Usage

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Long-range ambush | Standard setting, lead target significantly |
| Close brawl | Fast setting, tighter spread |
| Area denial | Slow setting, wide spread |
| Capital ships | Priority targets for max damage |

### Countermeasures

| Counter | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------------|
| Vigilant lookouts | Moderate (wake hard to see) |
| Torpedo spotting aircraft | High |
| Evasive maneuvering | Requires early detection |
| Torpedo bulges | Reduces damage ~15% |

## Historical Notes

### Famous Engagements

| Battle | Date | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Battle of Savo Island | Aug 1942 | 4 cruisers sunk |
| Battle of Tassafaronga | Nov 1942 | 1 sunk, 3 damaged |
| Battle of Kula Gulf | Jul 1943 | USS Helena sunk |

### Handling Dangers
The oxygen propulsion system made the Type 93 extremely dangerous to handle. Accidental detonations from oxygen leaks caused several Japanese ship losses, including contributing to the loss of cruiser Mikuma at Midway.
