# Testing Scripts

The Testing folder contains 5 scripts for port and harbor system testing.

## Port System Testing

- **ScenePortManager.cs** (15KB) - Manages port spawning and configuration in test scenes
- **SimplePortTest.cs** (31KB) - Comprehensive port testing system with docking, services, and visual feedback
- **PortConfigTester.cs** (8KB) - Tests port configuration validation and data integrity
- **HarborExitManager.cs** (9KB) - Manages ship departure from harbors
- **PortReturnHandler.cs** (6KB) - Handles ship return to port after sortie

## Purpose

These testing scripts are used for development and debugging of the port/harbor system. They provide:
- Test harnesses for port docking mechanics
- Visual debugging for port services
- Configuration validation
- Harbor entry/exit flow testing

Note: These are testing/debugging tools and may not be included in production builds.
